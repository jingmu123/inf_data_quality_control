Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) change, incident ESRD, and mortality were compared among patients with biopsy-proven focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), membranous glomerulonephritis (MN), minimal change disease (MCD), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), and lupus nephritis (LN). Competing risk models were used to estimate hazard ratios for different glomerulonephropathies for incident ESRD, with mortality as a competing outcome after adjusting for potential confounders.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of the 2350 patients with glomerulonephropathy (208 patients \\[9%\\] younger than 18 years) with a mean follow-up of 4.5±3.6 years, 497 (21%) progressed to ESRD and 195 (8%) died before ESRD. The median eGFR decline was 1.0 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> per year but varied across different glomerulonephropathies ( _P_ <.001). The highest ESRD incidence (per 100 person-years) was observed in FSGS 8.72 (95% CI, 3.93-16.72) followed by IgAN (4.54; 95% CI, 1.37-11.02), LN (2.38; 95% CI, 0.37-7.82), MN (2.15; 95% CI, 0.29-7.46), and MCD (1.67; 95% CI, 0.15-6.69). Compared with MCD, hazard ratios (95% CIs) for incident ESRD were 3.43 (2.32-5.08) and 2.35 (1.46-3.81), 1.28 (0.79-2.07), and 1.02 (0.62-1.68) for FSGS, IgAN, LN, and MN, respectively. No significant association between glomerulonephropathy types and mortality was detected ( _P_ \\=.24).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Our findings from a real-world clinical environment revealed significant differences in eGFR decline and ESRD risk among patients with 5 glomerulonephropathies. These variations in presentation and outcomes warrant different management strategies and expectations.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACEI ( angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ), ARB ( angiotensin receptor blocker ), DM ( diabetes mellitus ), eGFR ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ), EHR ( electronic health record ), ESRD ( end-stage renal disease ), FSGS ( focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ), GN ( glomerulonephropathy ), HR ( hazard ratio ), HTN ( hypertension ), IgAN ( immunoglobulin A nephropathy ), KPSC ( Kaiser Permanente Southern California ), LN ( lupus nephritis ), MCD ( minimal change disease ), MN ( membranous glomerulonephritis )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

It should be noted that I am no longer in the military and have not collaborated with scientists in the Department of Defense, nor do I have a special interest in promoting their conclusions. Having seen a large number of patients with Gulf War illnesses, I sought to provide a broad overview of the research on Gulf War illnesses and to put the controversies in perspective.\n\n【1】I would like to focus on several aspects of Haley's criticism. First, in concluding that large numbers of US troops were exposed to chemical weapons during the Gulf War, Haley and his colleagues represent a minority view. The only well-documented exposure incident occurred at Khamisiyah in March 1991 and has been exhaustively researched by scientists both in and out of the US government.\n\n【2】Any exposure was minimal, did not cause acute illness, and has not been shown to be the cause of long-term health problems.\n\n【3】No other cases of neurotoxic chemical weapons exposure have been confirmed.\n\n【4】Haley's references to other exposures represent early, unconfirmed reports that do not stand up to scrutiny. Virtually every major government or scientific group that has examined the evidence for chemical weapons exposure has found insufficient evidence to link chemical weapons use in wartime to Gulf War illnesses, including the nonpartisan Institute of Medicine\n\n【5】and a US Senate expert panel.\n\n【6】Next, Haley's repeated assertion that low-level, asymptomatic exposures to nerve agents such as sarin may produce severe chronic neurologic illness has not been supported by the bulk of human and animal research.\n\n【7】Follow-up of the Tokyo subway victims provides an excellent case in point that exposures leading to acute illness may have lasting effects, while subclinical exposures, like those postulated during the Gulf War, do not.\n\n【8】It is too soon to say if the findings reported by Haley et al regarding vestibular abnormalities and abnormal magnetic resonance scans\n\n【9】among their ill US Navy veterans are important or merely represent epiphenomena. These must be replicated by other research centers before such findings can be generalized. It is my observation and, I believe, that of most physicians experienced in Gulf War evaluations that Haley's patients are much sicker than average and that their findings may best be explained by selection bias.\n\n【10】Finally, dozens, if not hundreds, of researchers and government officials have independently reached conclusions that dramatically differ from those of Dr Haley. I believe this represents the outcome of careful thought on the part of many sincere individuals who have tried to find answers for ill Gulf War veterans.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Data from the 2009 to 2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used. The analytic sample included 3946 children. Parent proxy of child physical activity at each of the 3 2-year cycles was assessed. For the entire sample, there was a quadratic trend, with the number of days children engaged in at least 60 min/d of physical activity increasing in the period 2011 to 2012 (6.12 days) when compared with the period 2009 to 2010 (5.96 days) and then decreasing in the period 2013 to 2014 (5.83 days). A similar quadratic trend was evident for boys, those above the poverty level, non-Hispanic whites (particularly boys), and those with less than the 85th body mass index-for-age percentile based on sex. A negative linear trend was observed for those above the poverty level and non-Hispanic whites (particularly girls). In conclusion, these findings provide suggestive evidence that over the past 6 years (1999-2014), parents report that children's physical activity has slightly decreased in the latest years, with this observation being most pronounced in boys, those above the poverty level, non-Hispanic whites, and those with less than the 85th body mass index-for-age and sex percentile.

{"seq_id": "8dc0cd48-85b2-4570-b907-e9a7751be0c0", "title": "Applying to Medical School in the COVID-19 Era", "text": "【0】The already daunting process of applying to medical school has become even more stressful for premed students in this time of social distancing, tele-based meetings, and the general fear of COVID-19.\n\n【1】For many aspiring medical-school applicants, there is an increased sense of stress, as carefully charted paths to medical school become so utterly disrupted. Many of the traditional aspects of applying to medical school—Medical College Admissions Testing (MCAT); volunteering or working in hospitals; studying for long hours; and, if one is lucky enough, interviewing with medical schools—have all been greatly affected by this global pandemic. Colleges and universities around the country, for fear of becoming hot spots for COVID-19, have mandated students to vacate campuses and resume classes virtually. This poses several challenges to the potential medical-school applicant . Indeed, this pandemic may stimulate changes to medical education that were long overdue.\n\n【2】Table Challenges of Applying to Medical School in the COVID-19 Era and Potential Solutions\n\n| Challenges | Potential solutions |\n| --- | --- |\n| Lack of in-person interviews | Virtual interviews could be an advantage for people who are not able to pay the cost of traveling and lodging |\n| Delay in MCAT testing | Webcam-based system to monitor the test taker during timed tests |\n| Inability to volunteer in person because of social distancing | Other volunteer opportunities have arisen through virtual means, such as contact tracing or being part of a disaster-relief team |\n| Travel restrictions prohibiting accepted students from visiting distant medical school campuses | Tele-visits using virtual reality to explore the campus and interact with faculty and current students |\n\n【4】One of the biggest components of applying to medical school is taking the MCAT. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced testing to be canceled for nearly 2 months and even caused the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) to administer a shortened version of the MCAT. The premed students scheduled for those canceled dates were tasked with rescheduling the exam, and this delay in testing may have caused significant tension, as many have meticulously crafted plans for when to take the test. The MCAT could potentially be administered online to temper these disruptions and to provide constant service, moving forward. This would require the test takers to be monitored through a Webcam-based system in conjunction with possibly downloading testing software to ensure that no outside applications or resources are used. Although some may have challenges operating the technology, many may find this to be an easier alternative to driving to a test center, especially for those who live in rural areas where the closest testing center may be far away.\n\n【5】Along with MCAT testing, the average premed student typically volunteers or works in a hospital or laboratory in some capacity. Unfortunately, the social distancing and stay-at-home orders that had been placed caused many premed students to lose access to these opportunities. For example, most nursing homes have suspended all volunteer activities and visitation privileges in hopes of protecting their residents. Common premed jobs, such as scribe positions and medical assistants, were suspended for months, as physicians have many times transitioned to working from home remotely. Similarly, many basic science laboratories were closed for a period of months, and premed research assistants were not allowed to perform any on-site activities. Nevertheless, new online opportunities have arisen. In many states, for instance, the virtual job of contact tracing to aid in the fight against COVID-19 presented a novel opportunity for premedical students. This unfortunate pandemic has provided prospective medical school students the chance to help in a situation that is unprecedented in our generation. It is hoped that these challenges induced by the COVID-19 pandemic might also allow for applicants to experience personal growth; not everything will go according to plan, and learning how to adapt and overcome challenges is crucial, especially in the practice of medicine. Indeed, this generation of applicants will be well versed in dealing with the unexpected.\n\n【6】Every hopeful premed student understands the importance of the medical school interview process and, as such, spends the necessary amount of time preparing. How do medical schools adapt now that in-person interviews clash with social distancing guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)? Like many others who are now turning to the virtual world, medical school interviews may be conducted online through systems such as Zoom or Google Hangouts. This new online direction may have disadvantages, such as inability to actually read people and have more natural conversations. On the other hand, many students may find the virtual interview to provide a more comfortable setting from which to be interviewed; applicants may be more secure and less anxious while in their own homes. Overall, prospective students may find the virtual interviews to be a less intimidating process while still being engaging. As this pandemic has demonstrated, telemedicine is effective and may very well continue to play a vital role in health care for many years.\n\n【7】By having applicants become familiar with the tele-based technology, medical schools will be creating physicians of the future.\n\n【8】Many students applying to medical school face an enormous barrier: cost.\n\n【9】Indeed, the perceived and actual costs of applying to medical school dissuade many potential applicants who often fear applying to institutions far from home because of travel expenses. This worry is compounded, given the current economic climate. Families and communities across the country are facing financial uncertainty, as we are all still in doubt about the future. Minority communities, rural areas, and lower-income families have been hit especially hard economically during this time, as well as facing a disproportionate amount of morbidity and mortality caused by COVID-19. Students who would have otherwise been unable to apply to certain schools may now be able to overcome such hurdles because of the absence of travel costs. Once again, the pandemic offers an opportunity to reassess the status quo in a way that may prove beneficial, particularly to socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.\n\n【10】This could turn out to be the biggest silver lining of the pandemic.\n\n【11】There is much fear that there will be a second wave of COVID-19, as there was a resurgence with the influenza pandemic of 1918. Fears have been shared by the CDC director, as he has remarked that the country’s health workers may be overwhelmed should there be a combined COVID-19 and influenza season. Unlike other disasters, no one currently alive has any experience with a pandemic. The wisdom of elders of the 1918 pandemic is lost other than in the written word. Thus, there is enormous collective social anxiety, and medical students—an anxious bunch under the best of circumstances—are under tremendous stress: a fact those involved in the selection process must acknowledge and try to mitigate. Nevertheless, medical students are also some of the most resilient young people, and this struggle with COVID-19 will only make them dream bigger, work harder, and achieve more. Ultimately, this pandemic may bring forth medical school applicants ideally primed to tackle the uncertainties of modern-day medical practice.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【13】Despite the challenges noted, witnessing selfless health care workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic has inspired premedical students and likely strengthened their resolve to apply to medical schools. This moment of heightened altruism thus offers the opportunity for medical schools to streamline the admissions process and for medical school applicants to rise to the challenge.\n\n【14】Being a doctor will never be the same after the COVID-19 pandemic.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

We identified 2520 individuals undergoing dialysis or who had a kidney transplant by linking participants’ encrypted personal identification with the registry for ESRD with a median follow-up of 13 years. We classified participants into 5 categories measured by metabolic equivalent of tasks. Within each category, we analyzed the effect of moderate- and vigorous-intensity LTPA in reducing risk of ESRD. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to calculate hazard ratios (HRs).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We observed a dose-response relationship between LTPA and the risk of ESRD. The fully active group had a 12% lower hazard of ESRD compared with the no reported LTPA group (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80 to 0.98) adjusting for covariates including baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria.

Participants in the moderate-intensity continuous walking training group were instructed to walk at approximately 50% of their peak aerobic capacity for walking, using a pedometer to verify that they took 8000 steps or more per day for 4 or more days per week. Those in the high-intensity interval walking training group, who were monitored by accelerometry, were instructed to repeat 5 or more sets of 3-minute low-intensity walking at 40% of peak aerobic capacity for walking followed by a 3-minute high-intensity walking above 70% of peak aerobic capacity for walking per day for 4 or more days per week.

However, its occurrence in patients treated for osteoporosis is rare. Although poor oral hygiene and invasive dental procedures have been identified as potential triggers, little is known about the role of other systemic risk factors. We describe a patient who developed ONJ after her first treatment with denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against receptor activator of NF-κB ligand. This patient had several comorbidities that prompted us to assess the German ONJ registry for the incidence of comorbidities in patients with ONJ. In summary, almost half of the patients (35 of 86 \\[41%\\]) had 1 or more risk factors thought to increase the risk of ONJ. In conclusion, comorbidities or comedications may increase the susceptibility of developing ONJ during osteoporosis therapy.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ONJ ( osteonecrosis of the jaw )\n\n【4】Antiresorptive therapy using bisphosphonates is a well-established therapy for benign and malignant bone diseases. More recently, denosumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against receptor activator of NF-κB ligand, has also been approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and bone metastases. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a well-known complication of antiresorptive therapy for malignant bone diseases, such as skeletal metastases, affecting up to 8% of treated patients.\n\n【5】Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw: report of a task force of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\n\n【6】However, ONJ rarely occurs in patients treated for osteoporosis, which is thought to be related to the lower cumulative dose of the antiresorptive agent and additional host-related factors. It may be triggered by invasive procedures and promoted by poor oral hygiene, but little is known about the prevalence of comorbidities and comedications in these patients.\n\n【7】Bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw: report of a task force of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.\n\n【8】After having identified an index case of ONJ after treatment with denosumab, we assessed the German ONJ registry to define the role of relevant risk factors for ONJ during osteoporosis treatment in the absence of cancer. The patient’s file was analyzed for medical history, history of present illness, medications, and laboratory findings to identify potential risk factors for ONJ. Subsequently, we analyzed the German ONJ registry, which contains 1196 adjudicated cases of ONJ. All the cases had been documented using a predefined questionnaire.\n\n【9】Case Report\n-----------\n\n【10】We describe a 75-year-old woman in whom ONJ developed after the first subcutaneous injection of denosumab. She had previously sustained osteoporotic fractures of the proximal humerus and the hip while taking alendronate, 70 mg/wk, for more than 3 years. Her medical history included unclassified inflammatory bowel disease, previous glucocorticoid therapy, impaired renal function with a glomerular filtration rate of 50 mL/min, and chronic anemia for decades without the need for transfusions. The Fracture Risk Algorithm (FRAX) score assessment predicted a 28% risk of experiencing a major osteoporotic fracture during the next 10 years.\n\n【11】Treatment was switched to denosumab (60 mg subcutaneously). Two months later, development of ONJ of the right lower jaw required surgical débridement and antibiotic drug treatment. She reported no invasive dental procedure preceding the occurrence of ONJ. The diagnosis of ONJ was made by an experienced oral surgeon based on clinical and radiographic findings and was histologically confirmed by 2 independent pathologists.\n\n【12】Owing to the long duration of antiresorptive therapy before denosumab therapy, the cause of ONJ in this patient is likely to be continued suppression of bone remodeling. Until now, the incidence of ONJ associated with denosumab use for osteoporosis seems to be very low. To our knowledge, only 2 patients with ONJ have been reported, both occurring in the crossover group from the extension of the FREEDOM trial.\n\n【13】Five years of denosumab exposure in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis: results from the first two years of the FREEDOM extension.\n\n【14】On further evaluation, she was found to have heterozygous β-thalassemia with a hemoglobin level of 5.8 mmol/L (reference range, 7.4-10.7 mmol/L; to convert hemoglobin to g/dl, multiply by 0.6206) and mild to moderate iron overload based on a serum ferritin level of 665 μg/L (reference range, 30-400 μg/L; to convert ferritin to pmol/L, multiply by 2.247). Alternative osteoporosis therapies were discussed, but the patient preferred to continue denosumab therapy and did not report fractures or ONJ during the 14 months of follow-up with 2 subsequent injections.\n\n【15】Of the 1196 cases of ONJ in the registry, 86 were associated with osteoporosis treatment in the absence of cancer. All the patients had received bisphosphonates, including alendronate in 63% (n=54), ibandronate in 14% (n=12), and zoledronic acid in 11% (n=9). More than half of the patients (50 of 86 \\[58%\\]) underwent invasive dental or jaw bone procedures preceding the development of ONJ. Mean bisphosphonate exposure before ONJ diagnosis was 31 months (range, 1-102 months). Thirty-five of 86 patients (41%) had 1 or more comorbidities, such as current systemic glucocorticoid therapy (n=22; 26%), chronic obstructive lung disease or current smoking (n=8; 9%), diabetes mellitus (n=5; 6%), or hematologic disorders (n=6; 7%), as described in the present case. Although an association with ONJ has not yet been described, β-thalassemia is associated with a high risk of osteoporotic fractures, and alterations of the bone microenvironment and disturbed bone remodeling by iron overload have been implicated.\n\n【16】Thalassemia Clinical Research Network  \nBone disease in thalassemia: a frequent and still unresolved problem.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【18】Findings from this case, the first with denosumab in Germany, and the registry data emphasize the role of comorbidities in the pathogenesis of ONJ.

As we performed our analyses and initiated changes, we relied-whether intentionally or not-on the concepts outlined by James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras in their 1994 book _Built to Last_ ,\n\n【1】“A visionary company \\[or, in our case, ajournal-Ed.\\] almost religiously preserves its core ideology-changing it seldom, if ever. Core values in a visionary company form a rock-solid foundation and do not drift with the trends and fashions of the day.” Collins and Porras added, however, that, “while keeping their core ideologies tightly fixed, visionary companies display a powerful drive for progress that enables them to change and adapt without compromising their cherished core ideals.”\n\n【2】For this journal, our core values are simply stated: “We will promote the advancement of clinical medicine that results from integrated progress in medical practice, research, and education.”2 While preserving our heritage of effective and fair communication, we are willing to consider all reasonable methods for making this journal respond more capably to the revolution in medicine and medical publishing that surrounds us.\n\n【3】As we completed our first round of evaluations of the journal in early 1999, our unofficial mantra became “infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure.” We expanded office personnel and space and directed a larger portion of our effort to improving communications among our staff, reviewers, authors, and readers. These efforts met with success. By the summer of 1999, we had shortened the turnaround time for manuscript reviews, and we introduced a mechanism of expedited reviews for time-sensitive materials. The overall time from manuscript acceptance to publication also was shortened. These improvements in manuscript throughput occurred even as we experienced an increasing number of submissions. In addition to improving our logistics, we initiated changes to improve the content of our journal. Specifically, we are seeking more and higher-quality original research, recognizing that excellent original research is the foundation on which the future of medicine is built. We also negotiated for stronger and more analytic editorials. Besides recruiting traditional-format editorials, in late 1999 we made plans to publish a larger number of free-standing editorials and commentaries so that our readers can be better informed about the cutting edge of medicine and its associated controversies. The new free-standing editorials will begin appearing in the pages of the _Proceedings_ this year.\n\n【4】Jerome P. Kassirer, MD, in his farewell editorial as Editor-in-Chief of _The New England Journal of Medicine_ , used the term “university without walls” to describe that journal.\n\n【5】We too embrace this concept. Based on the idea that honest, scholarly debate is a potent stimulus for improving the quality of the journal's content, we have expanded and strengthened our Letters to the Editor section. As a result, in 1999 we witnessed a different level of debate within the pages of this journal. Other submissions to the letters section exposed us to brief original observations. The freedom allowed in this section of the journal, coupled with the relatively fast acceptance-to-publication times for letters, offers the promise of more intellectual spice in each issue.\n\n【6】As we initiated changes to the _Proceedings_ in 1999, we sought input from both fans and critics. During this process, we were impressed by the loyalty of our audience, and we were anxious to maintain the trust that has developed between the journal and our readers during its 74-year history. One of the factors contributing to this relationship is the readers' appreciation of the high-quality reviews that we publish. We plan to preserve the journal's review sections. We also will continue to publish case reports. As we do so, we will constantly reevaluate these portions of the journal to make sure that they provide valuable educational materials that reflect the current status of medical practice and inform our readers of areas of potential growth.\n\n【7】In 1999, with our journal enjoying a circulation of 120,000, our Editorial Board rededicated itself to better serving the needs of our 100,000 physician-readers whose professional interests are in general or internal medicine. In the year 2000, as in the past, authors from diverse disciplines are welcome to submit materials for publication in this journal; however, priority will be given to publishing manuscripts with a general or internal medicine message.\n\n【8】As we attempt to move this journal in a new direction, we are reminded that editors and editorial boards do not create research articles. Instead, we depend on our authors to provide the best materials possible from which we select (using a process of formal peer review) those published. We also are reminded that, prior to 1992, virtually all authors in this journal were members of the Mayo Clinic faculty. In 1992, the Editorial Board decided to publish manuscripts from outside Mayo Clinic\n\n【9】(although, for many, this decision has gone unnoticed). In 1999, the new leadership of the _Proceedings_ embraced the 1992 policy. As a result, extramural authors accounted for 27% of the submissions published in the journal in 1999. This reflects an increase from 20% in 1998. In 2000 and beyond, we welcome input from authors from Mayo Clinic, as well as those not affiliated with our institution, as they help us realize our goal of improving the journal's content.\n\n【10】We recognize that—now more than ever before—the public demands to be informed about the workings of physicians and scientists so that they can make better decisions about health care. In 1999, we began working more closely with the lay media to inform patients and the general public about the advances in medicine described within our pages. As we introduce these changes, we recognize that good research is judged only by scientific challenge and the test of time, not public popularity. We will, however, use any public attention to remind us to be constantly vigilant about the type and quality of materials we publish.\n\n【11】Although many of the policy and philosophical changes mentioned above have been in effect for mere months, the medical and scientific communities have responded to our changes with enthusiasm. The number of manuscripts submitted to this journal increased by one fourth in 1999, with the greatest portion of the growth coming in the latter months. We have used this opportunity not to expand the size of the journal but instead to focus the contents of this journal and improve the quality of the articles we publish. As expected, our rejection rate for the year increased by one fourth.\n\n【12】The integrity of any scientific journal is influenced by the quality and dedication of its consultant reviewers and editorial board.5 In 1999, we attempted to add new consultant reviewers to evaluate the diverse manuscripts submitted by our authors, and we attempted to better monitor the quality of all consultant reviewers' input. Effective with this issue, we also have expanded our editorial board to better address high-traffic areas (eg, in cardiology and neurology). This enlargement of the board was accomplished by adding additional extramural members.\n\n【13】To paraphrase the editorial comments of Frank Davidoff, MD, Editor of _Annals of Internal Medicine_ , the success and growth of any scientific journal depend on input from a host of individuals and groups, interacting in a series of positive feedback loops.\n\n【14】In my introductory editorial of 1999, I invited our readers to scrutinize our work at the _Proceedings_ and let us know whether we are accomplishing our goals.\n\n【15】As a result of this invitation, we heard from many of you. Further, we responded to your comments as frequently as we deemed feasible, and the journal benefited from these exchanges. Again in 2000, I invite you to monitor the changes we are making and give us your impressions. This journal is here to serve you. We members of the Editorial Board and staff depend on you to let us know if our actions are benefiting your practice and your patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Risk stratification in older adults undergoing coronary revascularization is challenging. Prior efforts have largely focused on traditional cardiovascular risk factors and established cardiovascular disease to predict long-term mortality risk.\n\n【2】Risk stratification for long-term mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\n【3】Older age is a widely recognized demographic risk factor associated with short- and long-term outcomes after coronary revascularization.\n\n【4】Risk stratification for long-term mortality after percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\n【5】Age frequently informs the anticipated risks of revascularization procedures and decisions about the mode and extent of coronary revascularization. Cognitive biases by clinicians may result in discrete thresholds of chronologic age to determine candidacy for coronary revascularization; for example, octogenarians are far less likely than septuagenarians to be referred for coronary artery bypass grafting.\n\n【6】However, chronologic age provides an incomplete picture of risk. There is emerging recognition that frailty, functional limitations, and clinical comorbidities that accompany older age may be more important to clinical outcomes than chronologic age. This concept, termed biologic age, or functional or physiologic age, acknowledges that individuals do not age at the same rate with the passage of time. Biologic age integrates functional decline, frailty, cognitive impairment, and clinical comorbidities and can also include emerging molecular and cellular markers of aging.\n\n【7】Clinical significance of biological age in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\n【8】investigate the impact of biologic vs chronologic age on long-term mortality in a single-center analysis of 535 adults aged ≥55 years who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between 2014 and 2018. All patients completed the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment survey and underwent a battery of questionnaires and functional tests, including tests to assess balance and mobility, at the time of coronary intervention. Biologic age was calculated on the basis of indices of cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities and deficits, subjective and objective functional impairments, or both deficits and functional impairments. After a mean follow-up of approximately 2 years, biologic age accounting for deficits and functional impairments yielded superior prediction for mortality than chronologic age alone. Biologic age incorporating functional impairments alone, but not comorbidities or deficits alone, was also associated with significant differences in risk prediction. The authors should be congratulated for prospectively assessing comprehensive functional phenotypes of patients undergoing PCI. A few limitations may limit the generalizability of the study findings. Most important, the comprehensive battery of tests and questionnaires performed in this study is unlikely to be widely implemented in most clinical settings because of time and resource constraints. This limits the applicability of the study findings to real-world clinical practice. Furthermore, the authors excluded patients with extreme functional disabilities, including those with stroke with significant residual neurologic deficits, severe dementia, or severe Parkinson disease, although this accounted for relatively few patients overall. Nearly 70% of patients in the cohort were men, consistent with prior studies of ischemic heart disease, which limits exploration of sex differences in the prognostic impact of biologic age. Although subjective and objective functional impairments were assessed, biochemical and vascular markers of biologic age, including telomere length, DNA methylation patterns, and inflammatory biomarkers, were not captured in this analysis.\n\n【9】This study highlights the importance of markers of frailty and functional status to predict long-term mortality, and these observations build on the authors’ prior work.\n\n【10】Unfortunately, structured assessments of quality of life, depression, cognition, and subjective and objective functional impairments are not systematically captured in routine cardiovascular clinical care at most centers. This represents a barrier to implementation of the study findings and missed opportunities to enhance risk stratification nationwide. Simple and pragmatic assessments of frailty and patient-reported functional status will be necessary to encourage adoption, to avoid surveys that are onerous to patients, and to limit burdensome data collection for medical staff. Approaches that leverage administrative data from the electronic health record to automatically identify deficits and surrogates of frailty may be attractive, but current indices such as the Hospital Frailty Risk Score rely on deficit models that require further study to evaluate their role for long-term risk prediction in patients with cardiovascular disease and after PCI.\n\n【11】Development and validation of a hospital frailty risk score focusing on older people in acute care settings using electronic hospital records: an observational study.\n\n【12】If routinely assessed, biologic age based on frailty would be important to improve national cardiovascular risk models. This would be particularly beneficial for providers in states with public reporting of PCI outcomes, where inadequate risk adjustment may incompletely capture the patient case mix and may lead to risk-avoidant provider behaviors.\n\n【13】Estimation of biologic age may also mitigate cognitive biases by providers in some cases, and data on frailty and functional impairments may inform shared decision-making about treatments. Finally, functional assessments at the time of cardiovascular care might identify individuals who benefit from interventions to reduce frailty. This could include nutritional supplementation and dietary interventions, prehabilitation before elective procedures, cognitive rehabilitation, and novel interventions that target frailty phenotypes.\n\n【14】Prehabilitation: the right medicine for older frail adults anticipating transcatheter aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass graft, and other cardiovascular care.\n\n【15】Ultimately, the authors provide compelling data that chronologic age is an imperfect measure of survival in patients undergoing coronary revascularization and that biologic age holds great promise. The burden is now to find the appropriate instruments and assessments to efficiently capture frailty and patient-reported functional status so that we may some day leverage these data to systematically improve the quality of cardiovascular care in the United States.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

She learned to read before she entered kindergarten, and during her later education, she became devoted first to mathematics and then to chemistry. At Hunter College, New York City, she became interested in physics. After she attended a lecture by the Italian-born physicist Enrico Fermi (1901-1954), her interest focused on nuclear physics. She was offered a teaching assistantship in physics at the University of Illinois (Champaign-Urbana), where she was the only woman on the 400-member faculty of the College of Engineering. She received her master's degree in 1942 and her PhD degree in 1945 with a thesis entitled “Doubly Ionized K-shell Following Radioactive Decay.”\n\n【1】After Yalow received her degree, she returned to New York and became the only female engineer at the Federal Telecommunications Laboratory, a research laboratory for International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT). In 1946, she began teaching physics at Hunter College but became interested in medical research. She became a part-time consultant in the Radioisotope Section in the Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital in 1947. When radioisotopes such as radioactive iodine became available from the nuclear reactor in Oak Ridge, Tenn, she believed they would provide “a torch to light the way to investigative medicine.” She began working full time at the Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital in 1950, where she was a colleague of Dr Solomon Berson (1918-1972). They used radioactive iodine to study thyroid physiology. In 1952, Berson and Yalow published an important article on the clearance of iodine by the thyroid and kidney. Francis Raymond Keating, Jr, a well-known thyroid expert, wrote that this article was “the most important contribution to the problem of diagnostic tracer procedures which has yet appeared.”\n\n【2】Berson and Yalow next applied their methods to the distribution and degradation of insulin. They noted that labeled insulin has a slow rate of disappearance in diabetic persons and hypothesized that insulin might be bound to antibodies in the blood that developed in response to the use of beef or pork insulins. Yalow stated, “We soon appreciated that the same methods used to quantify antibody could be used reciprocally to measure antigen, in this case the circulating insulin.” Thus, the radioimmunoassay principle was formulated. Yalow's report was initially rejected by a journal editor who did not believe that insulin could produce antibodies. The radioimmunoassay technique proved to be so sensitive that a Swedish scientist likened its power to detecting half a lump of sugar in a lake 62 miles square and 30 feet deep. Berson and Yalow subsequently used radioimmunoassay to measure parathyroid hormone, growth hormone, and corticotropin.\n\n【3】Yalow was the recipient of the Albert Lasker Award in 1976 and the National Medal of Science in 1988. She once said, “I have respect for people only because of the qualities they have, not because of their position.” She shared the Nobel Prize in medicine or physiology in 1977 with Drs Roger Guillemin (1924-) and Andrew Schally (1926-) for the discovery and development of radioimmunoassays of peptide hormones.\n\n【4】Yalow was honored on a stamp issued by Sierra Leone in 1995.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

This was a prospective cohort design including 342 patients (from October 1, 2010, to February 1, 2012) hospitalized for acute coronary syndrome, older than 65 years, in whom 5 geriatric conditions were evaluated at discharge: frailty (Fried and Green scales), comorbidity (Charlson and simple comorbidity indexes), cognitive impairment (Pfeiffer test), physical disability (Barthel index), and instrumental disability (Lawton-Brody scale). The primary end point was all-cause mortality. The median follow-up for the entire population was 4.7 years (range, 3-2178 days). A total of 156 patients (46%) died. Among the geriatric conditions, frailty (Green score, per point; hazard ratio, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.02-1.20; _P_ \\=.01) and comorbidity (Charlson index, per point; hazard ratio, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.0-1.40; _P_ \\=.05) were the independent predictors. The introduction of age in a basic model using well-established prognostic clinical variables resulted in an increase in discrimination accuracy ( _C_ \\-statistic=.716-.744; _P_ \\=.05), though the addition of frailty and comorbidity provided a nonsignificant further increase ( _C_ \\-statistic=.759; _P_ \\=.36). Likewise, the addition of age to the clinical model led to a significant risk reclassification (continuous net reclassification improvement, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21-0.67; and integrated discrimination improvement, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01-0.09). However, the addition of frailty and comorbidity provided a further significant risk reclassification in comparison to the clinical model with age (continuous net reclassification improvement, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.16-0.65; and integrated discrimination improvement, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.01-0.10).

Outcomes were growth in SARS-CoV-2 cases, SARS-CoV-2–related deaths, and mobility reduction across three settings: retail/recreation, grocery/pharmacy, and workplace. The main explanatory variable was the social deprivation index (SDI), a composite socioeconomic disadvantage measure.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Adjusted differences in outcomes between low-, medium-, and high-SDI counties (defined by tertile) were calculated using linear regression with state-fixed effects. Workplace mobility reduction was 1.75 (95% CI, -2.36 to -1.14; _P_ <.001) and 3.48 percentage points (95% CI, -4.21 to -2.75; _P_ <.001) lower for medium- and high-SDI counties relative to low-SDI counties, respectively. Mobility reductions in the other settings were also significantly lower for higher-SDI counties. In analyses adjusted for SARS-CoV-2 prevalence on April 1, medium- and high-SDI counties had 1.39 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.93; _P_ <.001) and 2.56 (95% CI, 1.77 to 3.34; _P_ <.001) more SARS-CoV-2 cases/1000 population on May 15 compared with low-SDI counties, respectively. Deaths per capita were also significantly higher for higher-SDI counties.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Counties with higher social deprivation scores experienced greater growth in SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths, but reduced mobility at lower rates. These findings are consistent with evidence demonstrating that economically disadvantaged communities have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Efforts to socially distance may be more burdensome for these communities, potentially exacerbating disparities in SARS-CoV-2–related outcomes.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】COVID-19 ( coronavirus disease 2019 ), SDI ( social deprivation index ), SARS-CoV-2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus )\n\n【11】To date, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected more than 32 million individuals resulting in approximately 986,000 deaths worldwide. Approximately 22% of SARS-CoV-2 reported cases and 21% of deaths have occurred in the United States.\n\n【12】There is growing evidence that economically disadvantaged communities have been disproportionately impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, shown through their higher SARS-CoV-2 incidence and case fatality rates.\n\n【13】Variation in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths across New York City boroughs.\n\n【14】To reduce the impact of COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have encouraged the adoption of social distancing, which has been mandated by state and local governments in various forms since March 2020. However, efforts to implement social distancing may be more burdensome for economically disadvantaged communities, potentially exacerbating disparities in SARS-CoV-2 spread and related outcomes.\n\n【15】As such, this study’s objective was to examine the relationships between socioeconomic disadvantage, mobility levels, growth in SARS-CoV-2 cases, and SARS-CoV-2–related deaths.\n\n【16】Methods\n-------\n\n【17】### Study Sample\n\n【18】The unit of analysis was counties in the United States. All counties with at least one SARS-CoV-2 case by May 15, 2020 (n=2833), were included. Counties with data missing on any measure were excluded, yielding a final sample of 2664 counties. Institutional Review Board oversight was not required as all data are aggregated and publically available.\n\n【19】### Data Sources\n\n【20】#### SARS-CoV-2 Cases and Deaths\n\n【21】Data on cumulative SARS-CoV-2 cases and related deaths reported on April 1, 2020 (baseline level for this study), and May 15, 2020, were obtained from a repository maintained by the Johns Hopkins University Center of Systems Science and Engineering.\n\n【22】The Center of Systems Science and Engineering collects SARS-CoV-2 case and death data reported by state and county departments of public health in real time. Data are combined into a publicly available, county-level dataset containing the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths on each day since January 2020 to the present date.\n\n【23】#### Community Mobility\n\n【24】Data on community mobility levels were obtained from Google COVID-19 Mobility Reports.\n\n【25】The Mobility Reports include percent changes in the frequency of individual visits to different types of settings relative to a baseline period before COVID-19 (the period between January 3 and February 6, 2020), based on aggregated mobile device user data. The settings tracked include: workplace, grocery and pharmacy, retail and recreation, parks, transit stations, and residences. For this study, mobility changes in the park, transit station, and residential settings were not examined due to a high level of missing data. Missingness occurred when there was an insufficient amount of data to ensure user anonymity, but does not necessarily imply low mobility levels.\n\n【26】#### Other Data Sources\n\n【27】The Robert Graham Center provides a composite measure of socioeconomic disadvantage at the county level based on socioeconomic characteristics reported in the American Community Survey, discussed below.\n\n【28】The Area Health Resources File (AHRF) is a publicly available, county-level dataset maintained by the Health Resources and Services Administration.\n\n【29】The AHRF includes combined data on economic characteristics, health care supply, population health, and other population characteristics from multiple data sources such as the Census and Medicare. For this study, the AHRF was the source of population size, population density, demographic characteristics, and level of urbanization.\n\n【30】### Main Outcomes and Measures\n\n【31】The study outcomes were growth in SARS-CoV-2 prevalence, SARS-CoV-2–related deaths per capita, and percent reduction in community mobility during the month of April 2020 in the workplace, grocery and pharmacy, and retail and recreation settings. The main explanatory variable for this study was the social deprivation index (SDI).\n\n【32】The SDI is a composite county-level measure of seven socioeconomic characteristics. These include: percent of adults without a high school degree, percent of households with a single parent, percent living in overcrowded housing, percent living in rental units, percent of households without a car, the unemployment rate, and the poverty rate. The SDI ranges from 1 to 100, with higher values representing greater deprivation. To facilitate the interpretability of analyses, counties were divided according to tertile of SDI (based on the 33 <sup>rd </sup> and 67 <sup>th </sup> percentiles) and classified as having low-, medium-, and high-SDI levels.\n\n【33】### Statistical Analysis\n\n【34】We examined the relationships between SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths per capita, and community mobility reduction with SDI graphically using locally weighted scatter plot smoothing (LOESS). To show growth in SARS-CoV-2 cases, we compared cumulative cases reported on May 15 versus April 1, 2020, separately for counties with low-, average-, and high-SDI levels. We also examined the relationship between mobility reduction and SDI conditional upon cases per capita in April because the baseline outbreak level may influence subsequent mobility reduction.\n\n【35】We then estimated adjusted differences in outcomes between low-, average-, and high-SDI counties using linear regression with state-fixed effects. Covariates included were SARS-CoV-2 cases per capita on April 1, 2020 (which effectively allows the model to estimate case growth), population size and density, and rural-urban classification, based on whether a county was located in a metropolitan, micropolitan, or non–core based (rural) statistical area as delineated by the US Office of Management and Budget. Because the spread pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to differ between urban and rural areas, in sensitivity analyses we stratified regression models according to level of urbanization.\n\n【36】Robust standard errors were used in all models. Data were analyzed using Stata MP 16.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Null hypotheses were tested assuming a two-sided type I error probability of .05.\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】The characteristics of counties with low-, medium-, and high-SDI levels are listed in Table 1 . Counties with higher SDI levels were larger and more densely populated, and had higher percentages of Black and Hispanic residents. The distribution of SDI component measures and the five study outcomes are also shown.\n\n【39】Table 1 Characteristics of Counties by Social Deprivation Index Level\n\n【40】CBSA = core-based statistical area; SDI = social deprivation index.\n\n【41】County SDI ranges from 1 to 100 (higher = more deprived) and was classified as low (1 to 23), medium (24 to 53), and high (54 to 100) based off of tertile rank.

Counties more impacted by COVID-19 reduced mobility at higher rates in all three settings (retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, and workplace). However, in every setting and for any given baseline outbreak level, counties with higher SDI had lower mobility reductions. Figure 2 A shows the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 prevalence on May 15, 2020, and baseline outbreak level stratified by county SDI. Figure 2 B shows the relationship between SARS-CoV-2–related deaths and baseline outbreak level. Counties that were more impacted by COVID-19 in April 2020 had on average more SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths by May 2020. However, for any baseline outbreak level, SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths in May 2020 were greater for counties with higher SDI.\n\n【47】Figure 1 Mobility reduction in April by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) prevalence on April 1, 2020, for counties with low, medium, and high social deprivation index levels.

In analyses stratified by metropolitan, micropolitan, and rural location , higher SDI level was also associated with more SARS-CoV-2 cases and related deaths in May 2020. However, in rural areas, there was no association between SDI and SARS-CoV-2–related deaths.\n\n【56】Discussion\n----------\n\n【57】This study shows a disparity in SARS-CoV-2–related outcomes between US counties with high and low levels of economic disadvantage. Growth in SARS-CoV-2 cases and related deaths was higher for counties with higher SDI levels. Compared with low-SDI counties, those with higher SDI levels had between one and three additional SARS-CoV-2 cases per 1000 individuals and between two and five additional deaths per 100,000. At the same time, rates of community mobility did not decline as much for higher-SDI counties. Compared with low-SDI counties, levels of mobility reduction were from 2 to 6 percentage points lower for higher-SDI counties.\n\n【58】Our results suggest that economically disadvantaged communities are most in need of SARS-CoV-2 testing, contact tracing, and social distancing. Social distancing has proven to be an effective tool for reducing SARS-CoV-2 spread.\n\n【59】However, for several reasons, vulnerable communities may not be as able to socially distance given that mobility reductions were lowest among high-SDI counties. For example, the proportion of intergenerational households may be greater in high-SDI counties, and residents may be more frequently employed in essential service positions (eg, grocery) or less able to access unemployment benefits. If individuals are unable to stay at home, additional policy efforts will be needed to ensure the safety of economically disadvantaged communities.\n\n【60】### Study Limitations\n\n【61】This study has several limitations. First, there are several weaknesses of the study data. For instance, the SDI measure was developed using 2011 to 2015 American Community Survey measures, and a more contemporary version is not yet available. The Johns Hopkins SARS-CoV-2 data are widely used and are consistently reported across counties. However, Johns Hopkins does not have control over the quality of the data submitted by state and local public health departments. The mobility data are derived from smartphone users with Google location services turned on. Although approximately half of smartphones rely on Google Android software, individuals using other operating systems and individuals without smartphones are excluded from these measures. Mobility and SARS-CoV-2 data may also be measured differentially by SDI level. For example, potentially lower SARS-CoV-2 testing in high-SDI counties may attenuate estimated differences in outcomes between low-SDI counties.\n\n【62】Second, we did not examine the contribution of specific socioeconomic factors to differences in outcomes because SDI is an aggregate of many of these factors. Third, due to the study’s observational design, the estimated associations between SDI and outcomes are subject to residual confounding. Fourth, we cannot identify a mechanism for why mobility reductions were lower in high-SDI counties. While we hypothesize that this was due to lower ability to stay at home, willingness to socially distance may also play a role. Fifth, we do not directly estimate the contribution of lower mobility reduction to greater SARS-CoV-2 spread in high-SDI counties because with these aggregate, observational data we cannot distinguish mobility reductions leading to lower SARS-CoV-2 prevalence from reductions occurring in response to increased prevalence.\n\n【63】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【64】US counties with higher SDI scores experienced greater growth in the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases and related deaths, but reduced mobility at lower rates.

Metabolic phenotypes were characterized jointly by body mass index and metabolic health: metabolically healthy underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese (MH-OB); and metabolically unhealthy underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese (MU-OB). Metabolic health was defined using the 2009 joint scientific statement for metabolic syndrome from the International Diabetes Federation Task Force on Epidemiology and Prevention, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, American Heart Association, World Heart Federation, International Atherosclerosis Society, and International Association for the Study of Obesity as having 2 or less components (primary analysis) or no components (secondary analysis) of the following: waist circumference of 102 cm or greater in men and 88 cm or greater in women, fasting plasma glucose level of 100 mg/dL or greater, blood pressure of 130/85 mm Hg or greater, triglyceride level of 150 mg/dL or greater, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 40 mg/dL in men and less than 50 mg/dL in women.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 19,941 adults, the mean age was 46.9 years; 10,005 (50.6%) were female. From 1999 to 2018, the prevalence in primary analysis declined from 33.2% (465465 of 1646) to 25.1% (454454 of 2058) (difference, −8.09%; 95% CI, −12.5% to −3.70%) for metabolically healthy normal weight, whereas it increased from 9.92% (178178 of 1646) to 14.1% (277277 of 2058) (difference, 4.17%; 95% CI, 1.13% to 7.21%) for MH-OB (both _P_ <.001 for trend). The prevalence of metabolically healthy underweight and overweight remained stable at about 1.62% (298298 of 19,94119,941) (95% CI, 1.38% to 1.89%; _P_ \\=.34 for trend) and 22.2% (4,275 of 19,941) (95% CI, 21.4% to 23.0%; _P_ \\=.14 for trend), respectively. The prevalence declined from 3.77% (72 of 1646) to 2.10% (68 of 2058) (difference, −1.67%; 95% CI, −3.22% to −0.12%; _P_ \\=.006 for trend) for metabolically unhealthy normal weight, whereas it increased from 19.0% (343 of 1646) to 26.4% (574 of 2058) (difference, 7.41%; 95% CI, 2.67% to 12.2%; _P_ <.001 for trend) for MU-OB. The prevalence of metabolically unhealthy underweight and overweight remained stable at 0.06% (11 of 19,941) (95% CI, 0.03% to 0.15%; _P_ \\=.84 for trend) and 11.2% (2528 of 19,941) (95% CI, 10.6% to 11.8%; _P_ \\=.29 for trend), respectively. Persistent differences in the prevalence of metabolic phenotypes were identified across multiple sociodemographic subgroups. For example, the prevalence of MH-OB increased from 7.58% (53 of 754) to 12.0% (79 of 694) ( _P_ <.001 for trend) for non-Hispanic Whites and 12.2% (60 of 567) to 18.4% (76 of 493) for Hispanics ( _P_ \\=.01 for trend) and remained stable at 22.6% (756 of 3,825) for non-Hispanic Blacks ( _P_ \\=.62 for trend and _P_ \\=.05 for interaction). Results in secondary analyses revealed similar patterns.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】From 1999 to 2018, US adults experienced major increases in the prevalence of both MH-OB and MU-OB, largely due to decreases in MH-N. The prevalence of MU-OB increased across all subgroups, with higher values observed in older adults and those with lower education and income levels.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BMI ( body mass index ), BP ( blood pressure ), CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), FPG ( fasting plasma glucose ), HDL-C ( high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), MetS ( metabolic syndrome ), MH-N ( metabolically healthy normal weight ), MH-OB ( metabolically healthy obese ), MH-OW ( metabolically healthy overweight ), MH-U ( metabolically healthy underweight ), MU-N ( metabolically unhealthy normal weight ), MU-OB ( metabolically unhealthy obese ), MU-OW ( metabolically unhealthy overweight ), MU-U ( metabolically unhealthy underweight ), NHANES ( National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ), TG ( triglyceride ), WC ( waist circumference )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Also, results of the complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), coagulation profile, and urinanalysis were normal. Punch biopsy from the left great toe revealed papillary dermal edema with superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic inflammation and endothelial cell swelling .

Although OSAS is a risk factor for perioperative morbidity, data quantifying the magnitude of the problem in patients undergoing non-upper airway operations are limited.\n\n【2】### PATIENTS AND METHODS\n\n【3】This retrospective, case-control study from a single academic medical institution included patients diagnosed as having OSAS between January 1995 and December 1998 and undergoing hip or knee replacement within 3 years before or anytime after their OSAS diagnosis. Patients with OSAS were subcategorized as having the diagnosis either before or after the surgery and also, regardless of time of diagnosis, by whether they were using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prior to hospitalization. Matched controls were patients without OSAS undergoing the same operation. Interventions were defined specifically as administration of a particular treatment in the context of each complication, eg, supplemental oxygen, implementation of additional monitoring such as oximetry for hypoxemia, or transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) for cardiac ischemia concerns. Postoperative complications were assessed for all patients in the different categories and included respiratory events such as hypoxemia, acute hypercapnia, and episodes of delirium. Serious complications were noted separately, including unplanned ICU days, reintubations, and cardiac events. The length of hospital stay was also tabulated.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】There were 101 patients with the diagnosis of OSAS in this study and 101 matched controls.

Although RCTs provide the best assessment of the overall value of a therapy, high-quality evidence from RCTs is often incomplete, contradictory, or absent even in areas that have been most exhaustively studied. Moreover, the likelihood of the success or failure of a therapy is not identical in all the individuals treated in any trial because therapy is not the only determinant of outcome. Therefore, the overall results of a trial cannot be assumed to apply to any particular individual, not even someone who corresponds to all the entry criteria for the trial. In addition, the potential for bias due to financial conflicts remains in many guideline groups. Guidelines are key sources of knowledge. Nevertheless, limitations in the extent, quality, generalizability, and transferability of evidence mean that we clinicians must still reason through the best choices for an individual because even in the absence of full and secure knowledge, clinical decisions must still be made. Clinical reasoning is the pragmatic, tried-and-true process of expert clinical problem solving that does value mechanistic reasoning and clinical experience as well as RCTs and observational studies. Clinicians must continue to value clinical reasoning if our aim is the best clinical care for all the individuals we treat.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】EBM ( evidence-based medicine ), LDL ( low-density lipoprotein ), RCT ( randomized clinical trial )\n\n【4】Evidence-based medicine (EBM) was originally defined as the process of “integrating individual clinical expertise and the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.”\n\n【5】The patient and the physician remained the central decision makers, but the physician was alerted to the randomized clinical trial (RCT) as the best experimental model to determine the potential benefits of new therapies. Evidence-based medicine, so defined, was unquestionably a major advance and an overdue corrective to medical opinions and decisions that too often were not based on rigorously obtained evidence, but rather were the products of inappropriate extensions of mechanistic reasoning and selective recall of personal experience. Beliefs, sometimes, became evidence. Patients with coronary disease died of ventricular arrhythmias. Therefore, suppressing ventricular extrasystoles with antiarrhythmic agents should save lives. However, this is not true. Indeed, the opposite was found in an RCT, and the death of that unfounded belief gave birth to EBM.\n\n【6】Randomized clinical trials are essential to evaluate therapies that reduce rather than eliminate a complication of a disease. However, EBM in its first formulation failed because most physicians did not think that they were sufficiently expert or had enough time to evaluate research publications that appeared with exponentially increasing frequency and often reported conflicting results that were described in a highly technical and recondite language, language that sometimes seemed designed to intimidate, not inform. In response, the guideline process was created. Experts were gathered and charged to evaluate the evidence and to issue recommendations regarding actions that should or should not be taken. The decisional process became codified and displaced from the individual patient and physician.\n\n【7】Much good has been achieved from the guideline process. As the guideline process has evolved, the categorization and weighting of evidence has been progressively formalized such that the “best” evidence is separated from the rest, and recommendations are to be based on the best. Thus, RCTs, and, even better, meta-analyses of RCTs, are the highest quality evidence, whereas clinical experience and mechanistic reasoning are not accepted either as evidence or as tests of evidence.\n\n【8】Guideline recommendations have become the standard of care, and quality of care is increasingly assessed on the basis of adherence to these recommendations. To be sure, the recommendations of guideline groups are always accompanied by a brief statement that they can be modified on the basis of individual patient circumstances and preferences. But just how this is to be done and what role clinical expertise and mechanistic reasoning should play in this process are not formally addressed. Indeed, if clinical expertise and mechanistic reasoning are disallowed any role in framing guideline recommendations about care, how can they be legitimate tools to modify such recommendations?\n\n【9】Unfortunately, the insights gained in every age may become its blind spots, just as its advances may become its excesses. Guidelines and EBM are no exception. We accept that RCTs are the best method to test therapies, and we salute the efforts our colleagues make in serving on guideline groups. However, we believe that the evidence RCTs provide is too often incomplete, inconclusive, absent, or outdated. Indeed, guideline writers themselves have documented that most recommendations are not based on RCTs and meta-analyses, but rather are increasingly supported only by lower levels of evidence.\n\n【10】Therefore, there is an inherent limit as to how definitive guideline recommendations can be.\n\n【11】Finally, and a point not widely understood or commented on, there is, at least for the moment, a critical limitation in our ability to meaningfully translate the overall results of a trial into the likelihood that an individual patient will respond to, or be injured by, the therapy that was tested.\n\n【12】Notwithstanding our colleagues’ best efforts, guidelines have not overcome these limitations in the evidence and its transferability, nor indeed have they generally acknowledged them. Thus, we argue that clinical reasoning—the expert, pragmatic, complex, subtle, analytical process that physicians and surgeons have routinely used to solve clinical problems in individual patients—continues to play an indispensable role in clinical decision making because the individual patient, who is real, and not the “average” patient, who is not, needs to remain the focus of our attention. We do not argue against guidelines being major determinants of care. We do argue against them being the only determinants of care.\n\n【13】Limitations in the Evidence in EBM\n----------------------------------\n\n【14】### No Evidence, Incomplete Evidence, or Conflicting Evidence\n\n【15】We contend that limitations in the evidence are a major limitation of EBM. For many clinical problems, there is simply no RCT evidence to apply. Consider antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis. The most recent guidelines\n\n【16】Prevention of infective endocarditis: guidelines from the American Heart Association: a guideline from the American Heart Association Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease Committee, Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young, and the Council on Clinical Cardiology, Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia, and the Quality of Care and Outcomes Research Interdisciplinary Working Group.\n\n【17】differ dramatically from those that preceded them.\n\n【18】Prevention of bacterial endocarditis: recommendations by the American Heart Association.\n\n【19】However, the evidence, or what there is of it, did not change. Time and many of the evaluators did. For many other issues, multiple RCTs have been performed, but the outcomes and the conclusions may conflict, with the result that meta-analyses are now considered the highest form of evidence. However, even the results of meta-analyses may sometimes conflict\n\n【20】and, even in the most intensively studied areas, knowledge remains incomplete.\n\n【21】For example, multiple RCTs have established unequivocally the benefit of statin therapy in reducing cardiovascular risk. Indeed, statin therapy must be among the therapies most intensely studied and a therapy whose value has been confirmed repeatedly and resoundingly by RCTs. Thus, one might assume that we know all we need to know about statin therapy. We do not.\n\n【22】Sharp public debate on the role of statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease remains.\n\n【23】In contrast, substantially on the basis of a meta-analysis of 5 dose comparison studies, the conclusion that the highest doses of statins are the best choice has been widely accepted, as evidenced by the most recent European\n\n【24】ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: the Task Force for the management of dyslipidaemias of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS).\n\n【25】and Canadian\n\n【26】2012 Update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in the adult.\n\n【27】guidelines. However, in 2 of the 5 studies that make up the meta-analysis, a dose of 80 mg, simvastatin once a day was used; unfortunately, this dose is not acceptably safe.\n\n【28】In the 3 other studies, 80 mg of atorvastatin was superior to 10 mg in one study and inferior to 20 mg of pravastatin in another, and 40/80 mg of atorvastatin was superior to 20/40 mg of simvastatin in the third study—not a compelling body of evidence on which to base public policy.\n\n【29】Moreover, the evidence as to the best dose of a statin is reportedly incomplete because, for practical purposes, only the highest and lowest doses of statins have been compared.\n\n【30】Indeed, there is no evidence that the highest dose of any statin is superior to an intermediate dose: 80 mg, atorvastatin vs either 40 mg, atorvastatin once a day or 20 mg, atorvastatin once a day. Although not always appreciated, most of the benefit in terms of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering is achieved with the lowest dose of statins. Doubling the dose produces only limited further lowering of LDL cholesterol, whereas adverse effects include myalgia, risk of diabetes,\n\n【31】Risk of incident diabetes with intensive-dose compared with moderate-dose statin therapy: a meta-analysis.\n\n【32】and perhaps an increase in acute renal injury\n\n【33】Use of high potency statins and rates of admission for acute kidney injury: multicenter, retrospective observational analysis of administrative databases.\n\n【34】as the dose increases. Thus, no recommendation of the highest dose as the “best” dose can be evidence based because the necessary evidence to do so is absent.\n\n【35】Nevertheless, the physician must make a decision as to which dose to prescribe to a particular patient.\n\n【36】There is also the reality that critical evidence will continue to appear in the not inconsiderable interval between editions of many guidelines. For example, the Cochrane Report that the treatment of mild hypertension—blood pressures in the range of 150/90 to 159/99 mm Hg—has not been found to be of clinical benefit appeared in 2012, challenging the validity of recommendations made almost a decade before.\n\n【37】National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure; National High Blood Pressure Education Program Coordinating Committee  \nThe Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure: the JNC 7 Report.\n\n【38】Publications of this potential import from sources with such authority cannot be just set aside until the next guideline group meets to consider its significance. Nor can their conclusions be simply accepted on blind faith. We need to reconsider the options with each patient we treat because we are always deciding in the interludes between the latest and the next recommendations.\n\n【39】Finally, randomization and blinded assignment, the hallmarks of an RCT, are not possible for many therapies, including most surgical interventions.\n\n【40】Challenges in evaluating surgical innovation.\n\n【41】Indeed, with many medical acts, not only is there a learning curve but skill and judgment remain essential determinants of the value of the intervention. What is of value elsewhere may not be of value everywhere. Just as in the end, all politics is local, so is all medical care.\n\n【42】### Limitations in the Generalizability of RCTs\n\n【43】By generalizability, we mean whether the overall conclusions of the study population apply to other groups of patients with the same clinical problem. Limitations in the generalizability of their results are the second fundamental limitation of RCTs.\n\n【44】The large clinical trials, which should yield the most secure results, require the participation of hundreds of sites, generally in multiple countries. The aggregate sample may be large, but inclusion criteria almost always ensure that it will not be representative of the overall population with the clinical problem. Age and gender restrictions are common. Comorbid conditions can be excluded from trials but not from clinical practice.\n\n【45】But the challenges go deeper. Even within the stated criteria, the sample selected may not be equivalent to the whole to which it is said to be representative. Usually, only a handful of patients are recruited from each center. How typical are they of the local experience? Patients recruited from specialty centers may not resemble those seen in general practice and vice versa. Patients selected for clinical trials differ by definition from those who were ineligible and indeed often differ from those who were eligible but not recruited, and these differences can affect the outcome.\n\n【46】Trials with run-in periods select patients (1) who can tolerate the therapy and (2) who respond to the therapy. The results of such trials should not be extrapolated to all those patients in whom such therapy might be initiated. And yet they are.\n\n【47】### Limitations in the Transferability of Group Results to the Individual\n\n【48】Randomized clinical trials determine the net outcomes in groups of individuals, but those probabilities are not simply and directly transferable to all individuals within the groups.\n\n【49】This is the third fundamental methodological limitation of RCTs and therefore of present-day EBM, a methodological limitation that has received little attention and one that most physicians are not aware of. The overall probability of benefit documented in the treated group in an RCT would apply only to individuals with characteristics identical to those studied if the likelihood of drug-delivered benefit and drug-produced adverse events was equally probable in all individuals in the group that had been studied. This is almost never the case. Within any clinical trial, individuals are recruited with various characteristics, many of which, even if not specified, will affect outcome. These effects are balanced by randomization into groups in the RCT but come into full play in the clinical outcome of the individual. Moreover, there is frequently substantial heterogeneity in the individual responses to therapy, such as the wide variance in lowering of LDL cholesterol by rosuvastatin,\n\n【50】Rosuvastatin, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 concentrations, and LDL cholesterol response: the JUPITER trial.\n\n【51】a phenomenon that should raise doubt as to the validity of any recommendation of a standard one-size-fits-all regimen–based strategy.\n\n【52】An even more dramatic reality is that the same therapy may benefit some and injure others, but the beneficiary and the victim cannot be confidently distinguished by conventional analysis of an RCT. We need to learn how this and identifying the clinical exceptions to the guideline rules and learning from them could provide important new insights into who is particularly likely to benefit from a therapy and who is particularly likely to be harmed.\n\n【53】### Limitations in Meta-analyses\n\n【54】Meta-analyses are considered the highest level of evidence. Meta-analyses integrate the results of a number of studies to calculate more precisely what the average result of an intervention is likely to be. However, meta-analyses select the studies they include on the basis of certain criteria. These restrictions may be reasonable to ensure that all studies are comparable in certain important aspects but will, unfortunately, from time to time, eliminate a particular trial whose design might mirror exactly a specific clinical problem. Moreover, in meta-analyses, the range of possible results is not presented, only the range of the average result. The trials included in a meta-analysis almost inevitably differ somewhat in precisely what treatment was given and to whom it was given. This may increase the robustness of the calculation of the average effect, but it makes less certain to whom this effect applies.\n\n【55】Although the relative benefit of a therapy may be similar in multiple patient groups, the actual benefit is almost always a function of specific patient characteristics. Thus, the older the patient, the higher the blood pressure, and the higher the cholesterol, the greater the absolute benefit of lowering blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\n【56】Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) Collaboration  \nEfficacy and safety of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol: a meta-analysis of data from 170,000 participants in 26 randomized trials.\n\n【57】So, the irony is that as our knowledge about the outcome in groups becomes stronger, the relation of that outcome to individuals becomes weaker.\n\n【58】### Limitations in the Guideline Process\n\n【59】Guidelines have become the forum in which the evidence is evaluated. Guidelines acquire their authority from multiple sources: from the perceived expertise and integrity of those who participate in them, from the prestige of the societies that sponsor them, from the renown of the journals in which they appear, and, increasingly, from the perceived consequences of not adhering to them. However, there are failings that have not been adequately addressed, which include the persistent challenge of financial conflicts of interest among those who participate, the failure to ensure that reasonable dissenting viewpoints in scientific debate are heard and that minority reports are provided when reasonable differences in view persist,\n\n【60】and, finally, the reality that there is no effective process to challenge the validity of specific conclusions that guidelines reach. For science to advance, challenge must be possible.\n\n【61】The guideline process is too important to fail, and we must work together to improve its performance. Nevertheless, even the powerful guidance to care provided by the guidelines does not relieve physicians of their responsibility to determine the most appropriate therapy for the specific patient they are treating.\n\n【62】What is Clinical Reasoning?\n---------------------------\n\n【63】If the highest-quality evidence is incomplete, as it so often is and as guideline writers themselves admit, how can the gap to best care be bridged? We argue that clinical reasoning is the best tool the physician can use to do so. Of course, our reasoning is imperfect, but, as Croskerry\n\n【64】has recently highlighted, not all forms of decision making are equally fragile. There is the intuitive mode of problem solving, the rapid, generally subconscious approach, driven by experience—an approach that, although subject to considerable error because of all our cognitive biases, is nevertheless indispensable given the number of decisions a clinician must make every day.\n\n【65】Clinical reasoning stands in contrast to intuitive decision making. Clinical reasoning is the disciplined, analytical, scientific approach that integrates all the relevant information in the search for the best approach to diagnosis and therapy for individual patients.\n\n【66】It does not supply generic answers for groups and is, therefore, not the same as expert opinion, which proposes general approaches on the basis of personal experience or personal analysis and which, deservedly, has been much criticized. Clinical reasoning is certainly not a license to guess or to ignore RCTs. Guidelines, which summarize evidence and offer recommendations, are the starting point of clinical reasoning. However, clinical reasoning accepts the probabilistic nature of decisions and acknowledges that all decisions are provisional. Clinical reasoning is pragmatic to its core because it declares that clinical decisions should be based on an analysis of the consequences of acting or not acting on what we think will happen to the patient immediately in front of us if we do this rather than that.\n\n【67】Complexity and imagination are defining features of clinical reasoning. Indeed, it is our individual abilities to imagine all that is possible, to grade the likelihood and the significance of one outcome vs another, to understand the limitations as well as the strengths in our analysis of the evidence, to evaluate accurately the condition and circumstances of the individual patient, to know in detail the multiplicity of possible responses to the therapies we are considering; it is all these skills and reasoning wrapped together that distinguishes the clinical reasoning of the expert clinician.\n\n【68】An example may be helpful. A postoperative patient was not doing well after mitral valve replacement, but there were, as is so often the case, many competing explanations without clear evidence for one as opposed to another. Routine investigations included echocardiography, which documented normal left ventricular systolic function and only mild aortic regurgitation. Nevertheless, the pulmonary hydrostatic pressures were markedly elevated, and no acceptable explanation was apparent. Thus, a decision was made to perform an aortogram; it revealed severe aortic insufficiency, which, by producing high left ventricular diastolic pressures, resulted in high pulmonary pressures. The severe aortic insufficiency was a complication of the insertion of the mitral valve, an unusual complication to be sure, but one that was hemodynamically devastating. Aortic valve replacement was followed by rapid and complete recovery. In retrospect, the echocardiogram apparently underestimated the degree of regurgitation because of the rapid decay in aortic pressure and the rapid increase in left ventricular pressure produced by the severe acute regurgitation.\n\n【69】Clinical reasoning is the problem-solving process that first determined the severity of the clinical problem (the patient might well not survive), then identified a specific feature that needed to be explained (the elevated pulmonary hydrostatic pressures), and finally determined that the evidence that had been gathered by routine processes (the echocardiogram) was inadequate and needed to be set aside. Indeed, our ability to recognize that the evidence may be misleading or inadequate even when we do not know the specific flaw at that moment is a hallmark of clinical reasoning. And so is the confidence to proceed when necessary with incomplete information and incomplete understanding. Only after the aortogram was obtained did the facts that seemed discordant and contradictory fall into place. This example illustrates why we characterize clinical reasoning as a complex, pragmatic, and imaginative reasoning process.\n\n【70】We stand with Bradford Hill, one of the fathers of RCTs, who said that “Any belief that the controlled trial is the only way would mean not that the pendulum had swung too far but that it had come right off the hook.”\n\n【71】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【72】Clinical reasoning remains integral to clinical care because the evidence from RCTs remains incomplete and the generalizability and transferability of the results of RCTs remain challenging. Few physicians, if any, have the time or the expertise to review all the relevant knowledge, and therefore, the guideline process remains essential to sort out and evaluate what is known. However, the evaluation of evidence is only one step in the process of care. To be sure, guidelines frequently state, at one point or another, that their recommendations are just that—recommendations—and they should be modified on the basis of the particular wishes and circumstances of the patient. They do not, however, identify this additional step as an integral part of the process, and they do not, specifically and unequivocally, validate clinical reasoning as a copartner in care. On the basis of the actual medical circumstances of individuals and their personal preferences, reasoned and reasonable extrapolations from recommendations remain essential, and guidelines and organizations that oversee care must leave room for this to occur.\n\n【73】Clinical reasoning is essential to integrate the knowledge from RCTs into a specific clinical context. We need to acknowledge this and value and teach clinical reasoning if we are to appropriately value ourselves as caregivers and meet our responsibilities to patients who have placed their trust in us.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

In his youth, his uncle taught him carpentry and he became facile with a saw, a skill that served him well in his later life as an orthopedic surgeon. After finishing secondary school in Saint Pierre, he obtained a scholarship to the French Institute in London (which had been temporarily moved to Scotland due to World War II) and crossed the Atlantic alone on a troop ship in 1944. At the time of his journey, he spoke no English, and had never seen a railroad train or visited a large city.\n\n【1】In 1946, a few months after the end of the war, Emile went to the University of Paris to study medicine. He developed an interest in orthopedic surgery. To apply for a postgraduate position to continue his education, he had to visit all of the relevant faculty members and present letters of recommendation, but he had no letters to present. A friend recommended that he see Professor Robert Judet (1909-1980). After a cursory interview, Judet offered Letournel a 6-month position beginning in 1956, despite his lack of letters. This 6-month trial soon became a permanent appointment as Judet’s assistant at Hôpital Raymond-Poincaré in Garches, a residential community in the western suburbs of Paris. Judet’s research focused on pelvic fractures, so Letournel began to study these as well.\n\n【2】In 1961, Letournel published his University of Paris graduation thesis, “ _Les fractures du cotyle. Etude d’une serie de 75 cas_ ” (“Fractures of the acetabulum: Studies on a series of 75 cases”), which included the first classification of acetabular fractures based on their radiographic appearance and brought him to the attention of the wider surgical community. Letournel continued to work with Judet until Judet’s retirement in 1978.\n\n【3】Letournel advanced to the rank of Professor at the University of Paris in 1970 and became head of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the Centre Médico-Chirurgical de la Port de Choisy in southeast Paris. He remained at Choisy — a non-profit hospital — until his retirement in October 1993.\n\n【4】Letournel soon became the best-known acetabular surgeon in the world, training numerous young physicians and regularly hosting visiting colleagues. He developed a database for the statistical analysis of both immediate and long-term results of treatment of acetabular fractures, published dozens of articles, and organized the first acetabular fracture educational course in Paris in 1984. In addition to his classification system for injuries, he developed 2 major surgical approaches (ilioinguinal and extended iliofemoral), innovative fracture reduction techniques, and instrument and implant designs that continue to be used in many orthopedic operating theaters.\n\n【5】Emile Letournel published several major textbooks on acetabular surgery. The first was in French, “Fractures du Cotyle,” and published in 1974. The second book was in English, “Fractures of the Acetabulum” published in 1981, and another with the same title followed in 1993.\n\n【6】Letournel’s contributions to orthopedics were not limited to acetabular fractures. He implanted the first knee prosthesis in France in 1968, performed more than 6000 total hip arthroplasties, devised a scapulothoracic arthrodesis technique for patients with fascio-scapulohumeral myopathy, developed implant designs and surgical techniques for management of calcaneal fractures, and regularly performed operations for bone infections.\n\n【7】He was admitted to the French Academie de Medicine et Chirurgie in 1981 and received the Legion d’Honneur from President François Mitterrand in 1988. He became known to the French general public after he operated on several Formula 1 race car drivers, including Jacques Laffite and Didier Pironi, and other notables such as the great chef Michel Chabran.\n\n【8】On August 16, 1994, at the age of 66, Emile Letournel died unexpectedly. Shortly before his death, he completed his 1050th surgery for an acetabular fracture. Following his death, his name was given to the Lycée and to a street in Saint Pierre et Miquelon. Emile Letournel was honored philatelically by Saint Pierre et Miquelon in 1999 (Scott #676).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Shakespeare experienced his first lockdown in 1564, the year of his birth, when one-quarter of the population died in his hometown of Stratford-upon-Avon. Throughout Shakespeare’s illustrious career as a playwright, London experienced repeated and devastating outbreaks of plague that forced the city’s theaters to close their doors to the paying public. Shakespeare’s family may have been touched directly by the plague’s indiscriminate violence when his only son, Hamnet, died in the midsummer of 1596 when he was 11 years old. Hamnet’s twin sister, Judith, survived. While the theaters were closed, and London’s citizens were sheltering in place, Shakespeare turned to poetry. His _Sonnets_ , a collection of 154 poems, offers a unique and unsparing account of human suffering. To those of us confronting the modern plague of COVID-19 in every work shift, the grief and loss of control can feel overwhelming. Shakespeare’s sonnets articulate parallel experiences of suffering and offer us compassion and perhaps even hope.\n\n【1】The sonnets are remembered above all for their anatomization of desire, but the shock of plague was never far from Shakespeare’s mind. In Sonnet 14 he describes its visitations as difficult to foresee, and unstoppably devastating, like “evil luck” itself.\n\n【2】The Riverside Shakespeare.\n\n【3】In Sonnet 111, which is sometimes considered the closest thing we have to Shakespeare’s autobiography, a life ruined by mistakes is compared with a life struck down by “strong infection.” The bitter remedy offered to this “willing patient” is a draught of vinegar, thought at the time to offer some protection against the plague, although Shakespeare hints that the remedy was ineffective.\n\n【4】Other sonnets make clear that Shakespeare, like us, had witnessed human suffering on a vast scale. Many such as Sonnet 19 deal with the merciless ravages of time that cannot be undone, no matter how dire the consequences, as the “earth devour\\[s\\] her own sweet brood.” Illness and death are ever-present in these poems, their relentless movement like the rhythm of the tides: Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, So do our minutes hasten to their end, Each changing place with that which goes before, In sequent toil all forwards do contend.\n\n【5】Here in Sonnet 60, Shakespeare expresses what health care workers and carers are currently confronting every day. Never has it been clearer that life can hasten swiftly and unpredictably toward an abrupt and unprepared-for end, and that death is as unstoppable—and disease as brutally unconcerned—as the turning of the tides.\n\n【6】Such is the scale of the task before us, and the seeming inadequacy of our resources to contend with it, that we may feel powerless to respond. Later the sonnet recognizes the particular vulnerability of the elderly who are exposed for no reason other than that their lives have been lived for longer. Four hundred years later, these patients again seem suddenly diminished, and painfully defined, by a disease that is devastating their generation.\n\n【7】Ageism and COVID-19: what does our society’s response say about us?\n\n【8】Whatever gifts time bestows on the world, time snatches away: “Time that gave doth now his gift confound.”\n\n【9】The sonnets also offer a remarkably prescient account of how it feels to be forcibly separated from others. One particularly distressing aspect of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the rifts caused by the isolation and quarantine measures needed to control the disease in the community as well as the infection control requirements in health care facilities. Families have been divided, often leaving vulnerable members to fend for themselves and making previously manageable distances impossible to navigate. Many health care workers are living apart from their loved ones, self-isolating to protect their families and control the spread of the disease.\n\n【10】People have tragically died in hospitals and care homes without the comfort of family members at their bedside. At work we are experiencing a new and unfamiliar sense of separation from our patients, and from each other, behind the barriers of personal protective equipment whose protection comes at the cost of meaningful communication. All over the world, face masks have become a starkly visible reminder of the need to keep apart. For all of us, in different ways, physical and emotional lockdown has become the new norm.\n\n【11】Sonnet 98 describes how it feels to be sequestered from a loved one, but also captures more generally the psychological and emotional burden of quarantine: From you have I been absent in the spring, When proud-pied April (dress’d in all his trim) Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing, That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leapt with him. … Nor did I wonder at the lily’s white, Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose, They were but sweet, but figures of delight, Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.\n\n【12】The spring Shakespeare here describes, like the spring of 2020, may be more vibrantly alive than ever, but it is scored over with a palpable sense of loss. Whatever is beautiful in the world is like a shadow of former intimacy, calling others to mind but also reminding us that we can no longer see, hear, or touch them in person. All of nature’s exquisite things are still around us: the sun, birds, color. But such pleasures reflect back to us the closeness we have lost: “They were but sweet … / Drawn after you.” Something is missing, even as the world keeps turning, as though we have been locked out of our ability to feel easy in ourselves. The thing that is missing is easeful contact with one another.\n\n【13】Yet Shakespeare offers something more, and more precious, than tired resignation in the face of the way things are. Loss, suffering, and a sense of absence are inevitable in the current crisis as life’s former routines feel more and more impossibly remote from our present realities. There is no easy comfort. Nevertheless, the same rhythms of time described in Sonnet 60 offer the promise of change and restoration. If the pandemic, its chaotic aftermath, and mortality itself are overwhelming and unalterable, there are still things we can do. The crisis moves forward relentlessly, but time in our own health care settings moves forward too, in a series of shifts “each changing place with that which goes before.” We change places with others more rested than ourselves, who keep giving care. If Shakespeare’s minutes “toil forwards,” so do the caregivers.\n\n【14】_All_ forwards, all _together_ . As long as the minutes roll forward, there is movement and change—and, with them, the prospect of recovery. It is this sense of renewed purpose and agency that the sonnet concludes by celebrating: And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand, Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.\n\n【15】Shakespeare recognizes the difficulty of holding on to what is worthwhile—our care for the sick and the dying, and for our loved ones—as time marches inexorably forward. And it registers the particular importance of recording and remembering such things for posterity. In due course, there will be time to reflect on and to process some of the cruelty and senselessness of what has happened, and perhaps to recognize, for ourselves and for each other, the things we got right: “praising thy worth.” In this way the sonnet looks forward to the future, with hope.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Reasons for stopping include symptomatic adverse effects such as hypotension or cough (in the case of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor \\[ACEi\\] use), hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury (AKI) events, or to regain renal function and delay dialysis.\n\n【8】Although the intention of the clinician is to prevent harm, it is unclear whether there are particular populations that might be at increased risk of harm or reduced benefit from RAAS inhibitor use. It may be that in advanced CKD, blockade of the RAAS is no longer of “renal value” and indeed potentially detrimental due to the reduced nephron mass and renal ischemia. Increased age, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), heart failure, long-standing diabetes, and macrovascular disease are all associated with increased serum creatinine levels and may represent populations who have limited benefit from RAAS inhibition . Conversely, those who are younger with early-stage diabetes and hyperfiltration or proteinuria may benefit. However, there is little evidence to inform clinicians on the use of RAAS inhibitors in these populations to optimize renal and cardiovascular outcomes. The UK STOP-ACEi (Multi-centre Randomised Controlled Trial of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitor \\[ACEi\\]/Angiotensin Receptor Blocker \\[ARB\\] Withdrawal in Advanced Renal Disease) trial, which is currently in follow-up, will provide additional important data on whether discontinuation leads to renal preservation.\n\n【9】Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial.\n\n【10】Figure Potential drivers of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition use and benefit in chronic kidney disease (CKD). eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate.\n\n【11】Discontinuation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in chronic kidney disease.\n\n【12】attempt to address a critical question on clinician habits in ACEi/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use over the past decade or so from their retrospective observational study of data from a community-based cohort receiving primary care in the Geisinger Health System (northeastern Pennsylvania). Their data reflect our unease at what to do to manage patients, taking into consideration their renal function, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, presence of heart failure, diabetes, and proteinuria.\n\n【13】Their retrospective review included approximately 54,000 patients with a mean age 60 years who had CKD grades 1-4. They observed discontinuation of therapy (defined as a prescription gap of ≥60 days) within 1 year for 20.7% of patients with grade 1 CKD, increasing to 45.3% for those with grade 4 CKD. By 5 years, the discontinuation rate was 46.8% and 83.7% for grades 1 and 4, respectively. The high rate of discontinuation, increasing with CKD grade, adds to mounting data indicating clinician unease in certain patient groups.\n\n【14】What can we learn from this additional data?\n\n【15】*   (1)\n\n【16】    Unfortunately, there were only 533 patients with grade 4 CKD (eGFR <30 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ), accounting for 1.0% of the total population, and grade 5 was excluded for unclear reasons, although possibly due to low numbers. There is therefore little information to add for the most advanced grades of CKD, although those who had progression to grade 5 during the course of follow-up were more than 4 times as likely to discontinue ACEi/ARB treatment compared with those with grade 1 CKD (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 4.62; 95% CI, 3.27-6.52). It perhaps would have been interesting to see rates of initiation by CKD grade for the whole population, if the selection criteria had been based purely on availability of the required laboratory data.\n\n【17】*   (2)\n\n【18】    The primary finding from this real-world cohort has confirmed, using Fine-Gray competing risk program modeling, that ACEi/ARB discontinuation was more common in those with a lower eGFR, hyperkalemia, hypotension, low serum bicarbonate level, and hospitalization, especially AKI related.\n\n【19】*   (3)\n\n【20】    Only 21.4% of those who discontinued ACEi/ARB restarted within the following 6 months. Those who discontinued at CKD grades 4/5 may be less likely to restart ACEi/ARB therapy, although the observed effect was small and the trend across the grades seen with discontinuation was not present for recommencement of therapy. Conversely, those who discontinued treatment after non–AKI-related hospitalization were more likely to restart (odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.09-1.37) than those who discontinued with no hospitalization.\n\n【21】*   (4)\n\n【22】    In addition, the authors noted that AKI-related hospitalization was the strongest risk factor for discontinuation (HR, 7.1; 95% CI, 6.11-8.25).\n\n【23】*   (5)\n\n【24】    A reduced risk of discontinuation was observed with use of thiazide diuretics (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.88-0.93), whereas use of loop diuretics was associated with an increased risk of discontinuation (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.18). The authors propose that increased use of thiazides could be a strategy for prolonging use of ACEi/ARBs, recognizing that this would require further investigation. However, it is unclear how much the observed association is due to reduced use of thiazides in the more advanced grades of CKD, in which they are putatively less effective.\n\n【25】These results were consistent for several sensitivity analyses to importantly discern whether the observed associations were medication class specific and not a marker of poor health.\n\n【26】The study by Qiao et al and other similar studies raise a few important questions. Should patients have a drug holiday during illness to putatively reduce the risk of AKI, or would maintenance of therapy be potentially protective? Clinical views are divided, as in clinical practice. Our clinical intuition suggests that we should stop, yet in many examples in the past our intuition has been wrong: β-blockers in heart failure or use of antiarrhythmic agents after myocardial infarction. Qiao et al\n\n【27】Discontinuation of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in chronic kidney disease.\n\n【28】found that AKI-related hospitalization was one of the strongest risk factors for drug discontinuation, with an HR of 7.1 (95% CI, 6.11-8.25). Although drug holidays or sick day guidelines are widely implemented, concerns have been raised that beneficial therapies may not be reintroduced thereafter.\n\n【29】This study does seem to support those concerns and provides some data on the reintroduction rates. Only 1 in 5 patients restarted therapy within 6 months of discontinuation, and it would be interesting to understand what factors affect this clinical decision, other than CKD grade and an episode of AKI. Despite the high risk for poor outcomes post-AKI, management remains poor and with a scant evidence base. In a retrospective observational study of approximately 46,000 patients in Canada, Brar et al found that 48% of patients restarted ACEi/ARBs within 6 months of an AKI episode, and this group had a lower mortality but higher risk of further AKI and heart failure. However, neither study can show if all patients recovered from the episode of AKI, what the rate of adherence to medications was, and, most importantly, the etiology of the AKI.\n\n【30】This study verifies that use of these drugs remains low for some groups, as recently also confirmed by Murphy et al, who noted that only 40% of patients with CKD are prescribed them despite guidelines in the United States. The observed high rates of discontinuation also confirm findings from a UK study of primary care records that showed 56.8% discontinuation at 5 years after initiation for patients with renal disease.\n\n【31】During recruitment for the STOP-ACEi trial, we have also seen differing views. The barriers to wider use remain elusive.\n\n【32】There remain many unanswered questions regarding the use of ACEi/ARBs in CKD. This study adds to our understanding of current practice and further highlights the need for high-quality randomized studies to allow us to effectively use this valuable group of drugs in an ever-aging population with multiple comorbidities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Persons in close contact with a patient with active pulmonary TB and those from endemic regions of the world are at highest risk of primary infection, whereas patients with compromised immune systems are at highest risk of reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI). Tuberculosis can affect any organ system. Clinical manifestations vary accordingly but often include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Positive results on either a tuberculin skin test or an interferon-γ release assay in the absence of active TB establish a diagnosis of LTBI. A combination of epidemiological, clinical, radiographic, microbiological, and histopathologic features is used to establish the diagnosis of active TB. Patients with suspected active pulmonary TB should submit 3 sputum specimens for acid-fast bacilli smears and culture, with nucleic acid amplification testing performed on at least 1 specimen. For patients with LTBI, treatment with isoniazid for 9 months is preferred. Patients with active TB should be treated with multiple agents to achieve bacterial clearance, to reduce the risk of transmission, and to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Directly observed therapy is recommended for the treatment of active TB. Health care professionals should collaborate, when possible, with local and state public health departments to care for patients with TB. Patients with drug-resistant TB or coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus should be treated in collaboration with TB specialists. Public health measures to prevent the spread of TB include appropriate respiratory isolation of patients with active pulmonary TB, contact investigation, and reduction of the LTBI burden.\n\n【1】AFB ( acid-fast bacilli ), BCG ( bacille Calmette-Guérin ), CFP-10 ( culture filtrate protein 10 ), DOT ( directly observed therapy ), EMB ( ethambutol ), ESAT-6 ( early-secreted antigenic target 6 ), HIV ( human immuno deficiency virus ), IFN-γ ( interferon-γ ), IGRA ( IFN-γ release assay ), INH ( isoniazid ), LTBI ( latent TBI ), MDR-TB ( multidrug-resistant TB ), NAA ( nucleic acid amplification ), PZA ( pyrazinamide ), RIF ( rifampin ), TB ( tuberculosis ), TBI ( TB infection ), TST ( tuberculin skin test ), XDR-TB ( extensively drug-resistant TB )\n\n【2】Effective medical therapy for tuberculosis (TB) has existed for more than half a century, yet TB remains among the most pressing public health issues of our day. Tuberculosis is, in part, a disease of poverty.\n\n【3】The fact that it remains the eighth leading cause of death in the world speaks to the challenges facing practitioners and public health officials as they try to control a disease that is so entwined in the cultural and economic fabric of society. Challenges to effective solutions include lack of access to diagnosis and treatment, the frequent coexistence of epidemics of TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB).\n\n【4】Tuberculosis control and elimination 2010-50: cure, care, and social development.\n\n【5】Although a chasm in disease burden exists between resource-rich and poor regions, an increasingly mobile and connected global community has ensured that TB remains highly relevant to practitioners throughout the world. This review highlights key principles in the management of TB. For purposes of definition, TB infection (TBI) occurs when a susceptible person inhales droplets containing _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ nuclei that travel through the respiratory tract to the alveoli. In most patients, an immune response limits propagation of TBI, resulting in an asymptomatic, noninfectious, localized infection that may remain in the body for many years. These patients have positive immunologic test results for _M tuberculosis_ and carry a diagnosis of latent TBI (LTBI). A constellation of clinical, radiographic, microbiological, and histopathologic hallmarks are used to diagnose active TB disease.\n\n【6】EPIDEMIOLOGY\n------------\n\n【7】An estimated one-third of the world's population is infected with TB.\n\n【8】Tuberculosis accounted for 1.3 million deaths in 2007, and the prevalence of active disease is estimated at 13.7 million (206 per 100,000 persons).\n\n【9】Incident cases of active TB are highest (≥100 cases per 100,000 persons) in sub-Saharan Africa, India and Central Asia, parts of Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and Micronesia. Intermediate incidence rates (26-100 per 100,000 persons) are observed in Central and South America, China, and northern Africa. Low rates (<25 per 100,000 persons) occur in the United States, Canada, Australia, Western Europe, and Japan.\n\n【10】While absolute numbers have been on the rise, the prevalence of TB in relationship to population has trended downward during the past 15 years, and global public health efforts have averted an estimated 6 million deaths during this time.\n\n【11】Tuberculosis control and elimination 2010-50: cure, care, and social development.\n\n【12】Nevertheless, the emergence of drug resistance coupled with the persistence of HIV and global poverty have thwarted a more substantive break in the TB epidemic. Indeed, 0.5 million cases of MDR-TB, in which the infecting organism is resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF), were reported in 2007, and 55 countries reported at least 1 case of extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), in which the organism is resistant to at least INH, RIF, fluoroquinolones, and either aminoglycosides or capreomycin, or both. The magnitude of the problem is particularly overwhelming in parts of the Russian Federation and Central Asia, where the proportion of MDR-TB among incident TB cases ranged from 12% to 28% between 1994 and 2009, compared with 0% to 3% in the United States.\n\n【13】As in the rest of the world, the incidence of TBI in the United States has declined during the past decade, but this decline has been much less pronounced among foreign-born Americans. More than half of active TB cases in the United States currently occur in foreign-born individuals, and most cases result from reactivation of LTBI.\n\n【14】Changes in the transmission of tuberculosis in New York City from 1990 to 1999.\n\n【15】The effect of global migration on TB has been seen throughout the developed world, most dramatically in London, where cases of active TB increased by 50% between 1999 and 2009, mostly among foreign-born individuals.\n\n【16】Sociodemographic risk factors for TBI include recent residence in an endemic region of the world, low socioeconomic position, being a member of a racial or ethnic minority (in the United States), homelessness, residency or employment at high-risk facilities (eg, correctional facilities, homeless shelters, skilled nursing facilities), and employment as a health care worker caring for patients with TB.\n\n【17】TRANSMISSION\n------------\n\n【18】Tuberculosis is transmitted through droplet aerosolization by an individual with active pulmonary disease. The highest risk of transmission occurs among patients with cavitary or positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smears\n\n【19】 however, patients with negative smears but positive cultures may still transmit the disease.\n\n【20】Tuberculosis transmission by patients with smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis in a large cohort in the Netherlands.\n\n【21】Host factors dramatically influence which of those exposed to TB are most likely to contract primary disease or progress to active disease. Those with greater susceptibility include persons with immune systems that have been compromised through either diseases, such as HIV infection and hematologic and reticuloendothelial malignancies, or through immunosuppressive medications, such as corticosteroids, tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors, calcineurin inhibitors, and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. Furthermore, patients with chronic diseases, such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and silicosis, are at elevated risk. Finally, age younger than 4 years, long-term malnutrition, and substance abuse are independent risk factors for disease.\n\n【22】CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\n-----------------------\n\n【23】### Pulmonary TB\n\n【24】**Primary Pulmonary TB.** Symptoms occurring around the time of inoculation are referred to as _primary pulmonary TB._ Symptoms are generally mild and include low-grade fever.\n\n【25】Two-thirds of persons with primary pulmonary TB remain asymptomatic. Physical examination findings are generally unremarkable, and the most common radiographic finding is hilar adenopathy.\n\n【26】Less common radiographic findings include pulmonary infiltrates in the mid and lower lung field.\n\n【27】**Reactivation TB.** Approximately 90% of TB cases among adults can be attributed to reactivation TB. Symptoms present insidiously, most commonly with fever, cough, weight loss, fatigue, and night sweats. Less common symptoms include chest pain, dyspnea, and hemoptysis. Physical examination findings are nonspecific and may include rales or signs of pleural effusion (eg, dullness to percussion). Chest radiography demonstrates infiltrates in the apical-posterior segment of the upper lobes, and up to 20% of these infiltrates are associated with cavities characterized by air-fluid levels. Although not specific for TB, apical computed tomographic findings may show a “tree in bud” morphology manifested by centrilobular lesions, nodules, and branching linear densities.\n\n【28】Pulmonary tuberculosis: CT findings–early active disease and sequential change with antituberculous therapy.\n\n【29】Among the roughly 15% of patients who present without upper lung field infiltrates, a variety of radiographic findings have been described, including lower lung infiltrates (especially superior segments), nodules, effusions, and hilar adenopathy. Finally, up to 5% of patients with active pulmonary disease may have normal findings on chest radiography.\n\n【30】Normal chest radiography in pulmonary tuberculosis: implications for obtaining respiratory specimen cultures.\n\n【31】This is particularly worth noting among patients coinfected with HIV, who are more likely to have atypical (eg, less predisposition for upper lobes) or normal findings on chest radiography.\n\n【32】**Endobronchial TB.** Endobronchial TB develops as the direct extension of TB from a pulmonary parenchymal source or sputum inoculation into the bronchial tree.\n\n【33】Symptoms may include barking cough with sputum production, and examination may reveal rhonchi and wheezing\n\n【34】 the wheezing may lead to misdiagnosis of asthma.\n\n【35】Diagnostic features and therapeutic outcome of erosive and ulcerous endobronchial tuberculosis.\n\n【36】Diagnosis and response to therapy may be assessed through bronchoscopy.\n\n【37】### Extrapulmonary TB\n\n【38】Extrapulmonary TB accounts for roughly 15% of TB cases among immunocompetent hosts and for 50% to70% of cases that occur in the context of coinfection with HIV.\n\n【39】In low-incidence countries, immigrants from endemic countries are much more likely to present with extrapulmonary TB.\n\n【40】As a rule, TB can present in any organ system; therefore, vigilance and examination for extrapulmonary disease are important for all persons being evaluated for TBI. A summary of the most common presentations of extrapulmonary TB follows .\n\n【41】TABLE 1 Diagnosis of Common Extrapulmonary TB Manifestations\n\n| Site | Diagnostic procedure |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tuberculous lymphadenitis | Excisional biopsy with culture |\n| CNS TB | Characteristic CSF exam AFB smear and culture of CSFPolymerase chain reaction for TB of CSF |\n| Pleural TB | Pleural biopsy with pathology and culture |\n| Tuberculous peritonitis | Laparoscopic peritoneal biopsy with culture |\n| Tuberculous pericarditis | Pericardiocentesis with culture |\n| Skeletal TB | Needle biopsy and culture |\n| Genitourinary TB | Biopsy and culture of massesCulture of urine |\n| Miliary (disseminated) TB | Culture of involved sites |\n\n【43】AFB = acid-fast bacilli; CNS = central nervous system; CSF = cerebrospinal fluid; TB = tuberculosis.\n\n【44】**Tuberculous Lymphadenitis.** Up to 40% of extrapulmonary TB cases are attributable to tuberculous lymphadenitis.\n\n【45】It presents most commonly in the cervical lymph nodes, followed by the mediastinal and axillary nodes.\n\n【46】A typical presenting symptom is long-term, unilateral, nontender lymphadenopathy; systemic symptoms are often absent.\n\n【47】On examination, the node is typically matted and adherent to surrounding structures.\n\n【48】If tuberculous lymphadenitis is clinically suspected, fine-needle aspiration should be pursued, followed by lymph node biopsy if the aspiration is nondiagnostic.\n\n【49】**Pleural TB.** Accounting for roughly 4% of all TB cases, pleural TB is the second leading cause of extrapulmonary TB.\n\n【50】In addition to constitutional symptoms, patients may present with nonproductive cough and pleuritic chest pain.\n\n【51】Chest radiography typically shows a unilateral effusion, and pleural fluid analysis shows lymphocyte-predominant exudative features with low glucose levels and low pH.\n\n【52】Tuberculous pleurisy: a study of 254 patients.\n\n【53】Pleural fluid culture is positive in only roughly 30% of cases, whereas the combination of histology and culture from a closed pleural biopsy specimen yields a diagnosis in most cases.\n\n【54】**Central Nervous System TB.** A devastating manifestation of the disease, central nervous system TB occurs in approximately 1% of all TB cases.\n\n【55】Tuberculous meningitis is clinically heralded by a 2- to 3-week prodrome of malaise, headache, low-grade fever, and personality changes. This prodrome is followed first by a meningitic phase that mimics bacterial meningitis (fever, nuchal rigidity, altered mental status) and then by a paralytic phase characterized by rapid progression to stupor, coma, seizures, paralysis, and death.\n\n【56】Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrates elevated protein levels (100-150 mg/dL; to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), low glucose levels (<45 mg/dL; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555), mononuclear pleocytosis, and an elevated cell count (100-150 cells/μL). A less common manifestation of the disease is central nervous system tuberculoma, which is characterized by single or multiple conglomerate caseous foci within the brain that cause focal neurologic symptoms and signs of elevated intracranial pressure. Finally, spinal tuberculous arachnoiditis represents a focal inflammatory disease producing gradual encasement of the cord with associated neurologic deficits.\n\n【57】**Tuberculous Peritonitis.** The most common manifestation of TB in the gastrointestinal tract is tuberculous peritonitis.\n\n【58】Protean manifestation of gastrointestinal tuberculosis: report on 130 patients.\n\n【59】Incidence of abdominal tuberculosis in Bangladeshi migrants in east London.\n\n【60】Cirrhosis and portal hypertension are associated with an increased proclivity for tuberculous peritonitis.\n\n【61】Patients present with insidious onset of ascites (73%), abdominal pain (65%), weight loss (61%), and low-grade fever (59%).\n\n【62】Clinically, tuberculous peritonitis may be mistaken for ovarian carcinoma or peritoneal carcinomatosis.\n\n【63】Unexplained lymphocytic ascites should prompt definitive diagnostic testing for peritoneal TB. Culture of tubercles obtained through peritoneal biopsy remains the criterion standard for diagnosis.\n\n【64】**Tuberculous Pericarditis.** In the developing world, tuberculous pericarditis is likely the most common cause of pericardial effusion and constrictive pericarditis\n\n【65】 however, in high-income nations, it is rare.\n\n【66】Patients can present with pericardial effusion, constrictive pericarditis, or a mixed effusive and constrictive condition.\n\n【67】Clinical characteristics and initial management of patients with tuberculous pericarditis in the HIV era: the Investigation of the Management of Pericarditis in Africa (IMPI Africa) registry.\n\n【68】Symptoms are those of effusion or constriction from any cause (dyspnea, cough, orthopnea, edema) in the context of systemic symptoms (night sweats, low-grade fevers, weight loss).\n\n【69】**Skeletal TB.** Skeletal TB occurs in 1% to 5% of patients with TB and presents most commonly in the thoracolumbar spine. Patients present with localized pain over the afflicted site; systemic symptoms are often absent.\n\n【70】Diagnosis is confirmed through culture of specimens obtained through needle aspiration or biopsy.\n\n【71】**Miliary TB.** The lymphatic and hematogenous spread of TB is referred to as _miliary TB_ .\n\n【72】Patient presentation is variable, and systemic symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats) are common.\n\n【73】When miliary TB occurs in the context of primary infection, patients maypresent with septic shock and acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n【74】DIAGNOSIS\n---------\n\n【75】The diagnosis of LTBI is established by a positive result on either a tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon-γ (IFN-γ) release assay (IGRA), in the absence of active TB. Active TB is diagnosed on the basis of a combination of epidemiological (eg, exposure, travel to or residence in a high prevalence area, previous TB), clinical (eg, cough lasting longer than 2-3 weeks, fever, night sweats, weight loss), radiographic (eg, infiltrates, fibrosis, cavitation), microbiological (eg, positive sputum smear or culture), and histopathologic (eg, caseating granuloma) features. Patients in whom clinical suspicion for TB infections is strong on the basis of clinical criteria should undergo chest radiography. Patients with chest radiographic findings suggestive of pulmonary TB should submit 3 sputum specimens, preferably obtained on different days, for AFB smears and culture.\n\n【76】At least 1 early morning sputum specimen should be submitted. Patients unable to produce sputum spontaneously should undergo sputum induction, which requires inhalation of an aerosol of sterile hypertonic saline (3%-15%) in negative-pressure isolation rooms.\n\n【77】Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage may be necessary in patients unable to produce adequate expectorated or induced sputum samples. Nucleic acid amplification (NAA) testing should be performed on at least 1 respiratory specimen.\n\n【78】Confirmation of the diagnosis of TB requires laboratory identification of _M tuberculosis_ by AFB smear microscopy with NAA test and/or culture .\n\n【79】FIGURE Evaluation and initial management of suspected pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). IGRA = interferon-γ release assay; LTBI = latent TB infection; NAA = nucleic acid amplification; TST = tuberculin skin test.\n\n【80】### Tuberculin Skin Test\n\n【81】The TST, also known as the Mantoux test, requires the intradermal injection of 0.1 mL of 5 tuberculin units of purified protein derivative into the volar surface of the forearm. The TST measures cell-mediated immunity manifesting as a delayed-type hypersensitivity to tuberculin purified protein derivative, which contains a mixture of antigens shared by several species of mycobacteria.\n\n【82】LTBI: latent tuberculosis infection or lasting immune responses to _M. tuberculosis_ ? A TBNET consensus statement.\n\n【83】The test result is recorded as the diameter of transverse induration in millimeters 48 to 72 hours after administration. Interpretation of the TST result varies depending on the prevalence of and the risk for progression to TB in different groups. Induration between 5 and 15 mm is considered positive and may be indicative of LTBI . The size of induration has some predictive value in that persons with TBI tend to have larger indurations\n\n【84】The effect of BCG vaccination on tuberculin reactivity and the booster effect among hospital employees.\n\n【85】 however, it does not correlate with risk for progression to active TB. An increase of 10 mm or more in the skin test reaction within 2 years in persons with previously negative results (conversion) is indicative of recent _M tuberculosis_ infection. The TST cannot discriminate between active TB and LTBI.\n\n【86】TABLE 2 Interpretation of TST Results for Populations at Risk of TB\n\n【87】HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; TB = tuberculosis; TNF = tumor necrosis factor; TST = tuberculin skin test.\n\n| At-risk populations | Positive TST reaction size (mm) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Patients with HIV infectionPatients receiving immunosuppressive therapybImmunosuppressive therapies include chemotherapeutic agents, TNF-α inhibitors, and glucocorticoid therapy (>15 mg/d of prednisone equivalent for >1 mo).Abnormal findings on chest radiography consistent with previous TB infectionPersons who have come in close contact with an actively contagious patient | ≥5 |\n| Patients with certain chronic conditionscDiabetes, dialysis-dependent renal failure, silicosis, and being underweight.Patients with certain malignanciesdLeukemia, lymphoma, and cancers of the head, neck, and lung.Foreign-born persons from high-incidence regions (>25/100,000)Employees and residents of high-risk facilitieseHealth care facilities, prisons, and homeless shelters. | ≥10 |\n| Healthy people at low risk of TB | ≥15 | a HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; TB = tuberculosis; TNF = tumor necrosis factor; TST = tuberculin skin test.\n\n【89】b Immunosuppressive therapies include chemotherapeutic agents, TNF-α inhibitors, and glucocorticoid therapy (>15 mg/d of prednisone equivalent for >1 mo).\n\n【90】c Diabetes, dialysis-dependent renal failure, silicosis, and being underweight.\n\n【91】d Leukemia, lymphoma, and cancers of the head, neck, and lung.\n\n【92】e Health care facilities, prisons, and homeless shelters.\n\n【93】Interpretation of skin-test results is the same for bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)–vaccinated and non-BCG–vaccinated persons. The estimated interval between _M tuberculosis_ infection and skin test reactivity (ie, skin test conversion) is 2 to 12 weeks.\n\n【94】Therefore, those in close contact with patients who have active pulmonary TB with initial negative test results should have the test repeated 8 to 12 weeks after exposure. Skin test conversion may also be due to new delayed-type hypersensitivity after infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria or BCG vaccination.\n\n【95】The phenomenon of reversion (ie, decrease in the size of the tuberculin reaction) may present problems in skin test interpretation when serial TSTs are performed. Therefore, TST should not be performed if a positive TST result has been documented previously or if the patient has been treated for TB. False-positive skin tests can result from BCG vaccination or infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria. False-negative test results may occur because of the following technical and biological limitations: presence of active TB; presence of other bacterial, fungal, and viral (eg, HIV) infections; live virus vaccination; immunosuppressive therapy; long-standing renal failure; malnutrition; lymphoid diseases; and age.\n\n【96】The TST may have a booster effect on immunologic memory in patients with a history of TB, previous BCG vaccination, and exposure to nontuberculous mycobacteria.\n\n【97】The effect of BCG vaccination on tuberculin reactivity and the booster effect among hospital employees.\n\n【98】This results in a positive TST 1 to 4 weeks after initial negative findings on TST. Evaluation for the booster phenomenon with a second TST 1 to 4 weeks after the first test (the 2-step method) should be considered for persons from countries with a high incidence of TB, for those with a history of BCG vaccination, and (as a baseline assessment) for those who need periodic retesting, such as health care workers. Test interpretation is based on the induration observed with the second test.\n\n【99】About 10% of immunocompetent persons with LTBI will develop TB disease over their lifetime, with the greatest risk for progression (5%) being in the first 2 years after infection with _M tuberculosis_ .\n\n【100】Approximately 50% of TB cases will occur within 2 years after initial infection.\n\n【101】The intrinsic transmission dynamics of tuberculosis epidemics.\n\n【102】Targeted tuberculin testing identifies persons at high risk of developing TB who would benefit from treatment for LTBI. These include persons at risk of becoming infected with _M tuberculosis_ and those with clinical conditions associated with increased risk of progression of TB infection to active TB . A joint statement from the American Thoracic Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides guidelines on testing and treatment of LTBI in the United States.\n\n【103】### Interferon-γ Release Assay\n\n【104】Serum IGRAs are in vitro tests of whole blood or mononuclear cells that are based on IFN-γ release after T-cell stimulation by _M tuberculosis_ –specific proteins (eg, early-secreted antigenic target 6 \\[ESAT-6\\] and culture filtrate protein 10 \\[CFP-10\\]), which are absent from BCG vaccine strains and most nontuberculous mycobacteria. The QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (Cellestis Limited, Carnegie, Victoria, Australia) is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay–based whole blood assay that measures and quantifies IFN-γ (IU/mL) released from blood collected in special tubes that are coated with _M tuberculosis_ –specificantigens, including ESAT-6, CFP-10, and TB7.7(p4). The T-SPOT. _TB_ test (Oxford Immunotec Limited, Abingdon, United Kingdom) is an enzyme-linked immunospot assay that uses peripheral blood mononuclear cells incubated with mixtures of peptides containing ESAT-6 and CFP-10 to measure the number of cells secreting IFN-γ (IFN-γ-spot–forming cells). Results of IGRA are reported both qualitatively (positive, negative, indeterminate, or border-line) and quantitatively (IU/mL or IFN-γ-spot–forming cells). Reversion of IGRA test results from positive to negative has been observed, particularly in those with negative results on the initial TST.\n\n【105】Conversion of IGRA (ie, a change in test results from negative to positive within 2 years) has not been associated with an increased risk of subsequent progression to TB disease.\n\n【106】The IGRA can be used in the same setting as TST but has the advantage of being able to differentiate _M tuberculosis_ infection from previous BCG vaccination and most nontuberculous mycobacterial infections; it may also be able to discriminate true-negative responses from anergy. However, currently available IGRA, like TST, cannot distinguish active TB from latent infection.\n\n【107】LTBI: latent tuberculosis infection or lasting immune responses to _M. tuberculosis_ ? A TBNET consensus statement.\n\n【108】Because ESAT-6 and CFP-10 proteins are present in _Mycobacterium marinum, Mycobacterium kansasii_ , and _Mycobacterium szulgai_ , false-positive IGRA results are possible. As with negative TST findings, negative findings on IGRA may not exclude TB infection in immunosuppressed persons. An IGRA is the preferred method of testing for groups of people who have low rates of returning to have their TST test results read and for those who have received BCG vaccine. The TST is preferred for testing children younger than 5 years. For other groups being tested for LTBI, either TST or IGRA may be used.\n\n【109】A summary of tests for TB is presented in Table 3 .\n\n【110】TABLE 3 Key Features of Tests for TB\n\n| Test | Strengths | Limitations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Tuberculin skin test | High specificity in non–BCG-vaccinated populationsCost-effectiveness | Training required for administration and interpretationReturn visit required in 48–72 h for test resultPossible booster effectPossible false-positive and false-negative results |\n| Interferon-γ release assay | High specificityOnly 1 patient visit requiredResults available in 16–24 hNo confounding by BCG vaccination | Blood withdrawal requiredIndeterminate results in those who are immunosuppressed and in those aged <5 yNo capacity to differentiate between latent and active TB High cost |\n| Chest radiography | Ready availabilityCapacity to differentiate latent infection from active TB | Low sensitivity and specificityNot confirmatory |\n| Smear microscopy | Ease, speed, and cost-effectiveness of the techniqueQuantitative estimate of the number of bacilliUsefulness in determining infectiousness and in monitoring treatment progress | Low sensitivityNo capacity to differentiate from nontuberculous mycobacteria |\n| Nucleic acid amplification test | High specificityHigher sensitivity than smear microscopyRapid (1–2 d) diagnosisCapacity to differentiate TB from other mycobacteria | Low sensitivity with smear-negative TBContamination-proneTechnical skill and expertise requiredResults may remain positive in patients who have completed treatmentHigh cost |\n| Culture in solid media | Examination of colony morphology possibleQuantitative results | Wait of 3–8 wk for result |\n| Automated liquid culture | Sensitivity greater than culture in solid mediaFaster results (1–3 wk) | Contamination-proneStringent quality assurance systems requiredExpensive equipment required |\n\n【112】BCG = bacille Calmette-Guérin; TB = tuberculosis.\n\n【113】### Chest Radiography\n\n【114】Chest radiography is indicated for all persons being evaluated for LTBI or active TB. Pulmonary TB as a result of endogenous reactivation of latent infection classically presents with infiltrates in the apical and posterior segments of the right upper lobe, the apical-posterior segment of the left upper lobe, and the superior segment of the lower lobe. Cavitation, fibrosis, and/or enlargement of the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes may be present. In some cases, pulmonary TB may present as lobar or segmental infiltrates, lung mass, scattered fibronodular lesions (“miliary”), or pleural effusions.\n\n【115】### Smear Microscopy\n\n【116】Smear microscopy for the detection of AFB is the most rapid and inexpensive method for TB diagnosis. Two commonly used methods for AFB staining are the carbolfuchsin methods (eg, Ziehl-Neelsen and Kinyoun methods) and the fluorochrome procedure using auramine O or auramine-rhodamine dyes. The fluorochrome method with fluorescence microscopy is preferred because it is far more sensitive than the carbolfuchsin methods. The finding of AFB on respiratory specimens associated with the appropriate epidemiological, clinical, and radiographic findings is highly suggestive of TB.\n\n【117】### Nucleic Acid Amplification Test\n\n【118】The NAA test is useful for the rapid detection of _M tuberculosis_ in respiratory specimens. The Enhanced Amplified MTD (Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct) test (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA) detects _M tuberculosis_ ribosomal RNA directly from AFB smear–positive and AFB smear–negative respiratory specimens from patients with suspected TB. The Amplicor MTB (Mycobacterium Tuberculosis) test (Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, NJ) detects _M tuberculosis_ DNA in AFB smear–positive respiratory specimens.\n\n【119】Interpretation of NAA test results should be correlated with AFB smear results.\n\n【120】Positive findings on the NAA test and a positive sputum AFB smear are strongly indicative of TB.\n\n【121】Feasibility of shortening respiratory isolation with a single sputum nucleic acid amplification test.\n\n【122】The role of clinical suspicion in evaluating a new diagnostic test for active tuberculosis: results of a multicenter prospective trial.\n\n【123】When NAA and sputum microscopy test results are discordant, physicians should exercise their clinical judgment in deciding whether to start anti-TB treatment while culture results are awaited.\n\n【124】When the clinical suspicion for TB is high, a positive NAA test result in smear-negative cases can be valuable for the early detection of TB in approximately 50% to 80% of cases.\n\n【125】Use of the amplified _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ direct test in a public health laboratory: test performance and impact on clinical care.\n\n【126】Findings on the NAA test often remain positive after cultures become negative during therapy and can remain positive even after completion of therapy\n\n【127】 therefore, it should not be used for assessing infectivity or response to treatment.\n\n【128】### Culture\n\n【129】Culture remains the criterion standard for laboratory confirmation of TB. Three types of culture media are available for the microbiological detection of _M tuberculosis_ : egg-based (Löwenstein-Jensen), agar-based (Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11), and liquid (Middlebrook 7H12 and other commercial broth systems). Mycobacterial growth tends to be slightly better on the egg-based medium but more rapid on the agar medium. Growth in liquid media is faster than growth on solid media and allows detection in 1 to 3 weeks.\n\n【130】The development of automated liquid culture systems for mycobacterial growth detection, such as BACTEC 460TB and BACTEC MGIT960 (Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks, MD), VersaTREK Myco (Trek Diagnostic Systems, Westlake, OH), and BacT/Alert 3D (bioMérieux, Durham, NC), which are faster and more sensitive than solid media, has clearly facilitated TB diagnosis in the past decade.\n\n【131】### New Technology\n\n【132】Several recently developed tests for TB, including molecular drug resistance, have the potential for providing rapid diagnosis and targeted treatment.\n\n【133】Rapid molecular detection of tuberculosis and rifampin resistance.\n\n【134】These fully automated tests provide rapid drug-resistance testing for RIF and INH; however, they require sophisticated technology and are currently available only at reference laboratories.\n\n【135】### Other Considerations\n\n【136】At the start of LTBI therapy, baseline measurements of serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and bilirubin are recommended for patients who have a history of liver disease (eg, hepatitis B or C, alcoholic hepatitis, or cirrhosis), use alcohol regularly, have risk factors for chronic liver disease, are infected with HIV, are pregnant, or have given birth within the past 3 months.\n\n【137】All patients diagnosed as having LTBI should be offered voluntary HIV counseling and testing.\n\n【138】All patients with active TB should receive counseling and be tested for HIV infection. Serologic tests for hepatitis B and C should be performed for patients with risk factors such as injection drug use, foreign birth, and HIV infection. Susceptibility testing for INH, RIF, ethambutol (EMB), and pyrazinamide (PZA) should be performed on any initial culture that is positive. Susceptibility testing to the second-line drugs should be performed on specimens from patients who have had previous therapy, are known to have resistance to first-line drugs, are contacts of patients with drug-resistant TB, or have persistently positive cultures 3 months or more after starting treatment. Baseline measurements of platelet count and serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and serum creatinine levels are recommended for all patients starting TB treatment.\n\n【139】TREATMENT\n---------\n\n【140】### Latent TB Infection\n\n【141】Treatment for LTBI is recommended for persons deemed to be at relatively high risk of developing active TB  and should be initiated only after active TB has been excluded by clinical and radiographic evaluations. Failure to rule out TB may result in inadequate treatment and development of drug resistance. For most patients, treatment with INH for 9 months is preferred .\n\n【142】Pyridoxine supplementation (25 mg/d) to INH is recommended for patients at an increased risk of neuropathy, including those with preexisting peripheral neuropathy, nutritional deficiency, diabetes mellitus, HIV infection, renal failure, alcoholism, or thyroid disease and those who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Intermittent treatment (ie, a twice-weekly regimen) should only be performed as directly observed therapy (DOT). Due to the high rates of hospitalization and death from liver injury, the combination of RIF and PZA is no longer recommended for the treatment of LTBI.\n\n【143】TABLE 4 Treatment Regimens for Latent Tuberculosis Infection\n\n【144】Data from _MMWR Recomm Rep._\n\n| Medication | Adult dose (maximum) | Interval and duration |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preferred regimen |  |  |\n| Isoniazid | 5 mg/kg (300 mg) | Daily for 9 mo |\n| Alternative regimens |  |  |\n| Isoniazid | 15 mg/kg (900 mg) | Twice weekly for 9 mo |\n| Isoniazid | 5 mg/kg (300 mg) | Daily for 6 mo |\n| Isoniazid | 15 mg/kg (900 mg) | Twice weekly for 6 mo |\n| Rifampin | 10 mg/kg (600 mg) | Daily for 4 mo |\n\n【146】### Active TB\n\n【147】Patients with active TB should be treated with multiple agents to achieve bacterial clearance, to reduce the risk of transmission, and to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Directly observed therapy, which involves direct observation of patients ingesting anti-TB medications, is the preferred management strategy for all patients being treated for TB. For treatment to be successful, patient-centered case management and close collaboration between health care professionals and local public health programs are imperative.\n\n【148】Medications for treating TB are classified as first- and second-line drugs . First-line drugs are INH, RIF, EMB, and PZA. The rifamycin derivatives rifapentine and rifabutin are also considered among the first-line drugs. Second-line drugs include the aminoglycosides streptomycin, kanamycin, and amikacin; the polypeptide capreomycin; p-aminosalicylic acid; cycloserine; the thioamides ethionamide and prothionamide; and several fluoroquinolones (eg, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin and gatifloxacin). The American Thoracic Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America have issued a joint statement on the treatment of TB in the United States.\n\n【149】An overview of this guideline and summary recommendations follow.\n\n【150】TABLE 5 Doses and Adverse Effects of Antituberculosis Medications\n\n【151】GI = gastrointestinal;

Although these regimens are broadly applicable, treatment must be individualized on the basis of each patient's clinical situation. Each of the 4 TB treatment regimens has an initial phase of 2 months followed by a continuation phase of 4 or 7 months . Treatment in the initial phase is usually empirical because susceptibility data may not be available. To guard against drug resistance and to ensure maximal effectiveness, the initial phase of treatment should include 4 drugs (INH, RIF, PZA, and EMB). If the isolate is susceptible to INH and RIF, EMB can be discontinued. Depending on the regimen chosen, medication in the initial phase may be given daily throughout treatment, daily for 2 weeks then twice weekly thereafter, or 3 times weekly throughout. Susceptibility data should direct treatment in the continuation phase, which lasts for 4 months in most patients. The continuation phase of treatment should be extended to 7 months for the following 3 groups of patients: those with cavitary pulmonary TB whose sputum culture remains positive after 2 months of treatment; those in whom the initial phase of treatment did not include PZA (eg, thosewho have severe liver disease or are pregnant); and those being treated with once-weekly INH and rifapentine whose sputum culture remains positive after 2 months of treatment. Extending the continuation phase of treatment in these situations reduces the rate of relapse. During the continuation phase, medications may be given daily or 2 to 3 times a week with DOT.\n\n【155】TABLE 6 Treatment Regimens for Drug-Susceptible Pulmonary Tuberculosis\n\n【156】Data from _MMWR Recomm Rep._\n\n| Initial phase | Continuation phase |\n| --- | --- |\n| Regimen | Drugs | Interval and doses (duration) | Regimen | Drugs | Interval and doses (duration) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1 | IsoniazidRifampinPyrazinamideEthambutolaEthambutol need not be included when the organism is known to be fully susceptible. | 7 d/wk for 56 doses (8 wk) or 5 d/wk for 40 doses (8 wk) | 1a | IsoniazidRifampin | 7 d/wk for 126 doses (18 wk) or 5 d/wk for 90 doses (18 wk) |\n|  |  |  | 1b | IsoniazidRifampin | Twice weekly for 36 doses (18 wk) |\n|  |  |  | 1c | IsoniazidRifapentine | Once weekly for 18 doses (18 wk) |\n| 2 | IsoniazidRifampinPyrazinamideEthambutolaEthambutol need not be included when the organism is known to be fully susceptible. | 7 d/wk for 14 doses (2 wk), then twice weekly for 12 doses (6 wk); or 5 d/wk for 10 doses (2 wk), then twice weekly for 12 doses (6 wk) | 2a | IsoniazidRifampin | Twice weekly for 36 doses (18 wk) |\n|  |  |  | 2b | IsoniazidRifapentine | Once weekly for 18 doses (18 wk) |\n| 3 | IsoniazidRifampinPyrazinamideEthambutolaEthambutol need not be included when the organism is known to be fully susceptible. | 3 times weekly for 24 doses (8 wk) | 3a | IsoniazidRifampin | 3 times weekly for 54 doses (18 wk) |\n| 4 | IsoniazidRifampinEthambutolaEthambutol need not be included when the organism is known to be fully susceptible. | 7 d/wk for 56 doses (8 wk); or 5 d/wk for 40 doses (8 wk) | 4a | IsoniazidRifampin | 7 d/wk for 217 doses (31 wk); or 5 d/wk for 155 doses (31 wk) |\n|  |  |  | 4b | IsoniazidRifampin | Twice weekly for 62 doses (31 wk) | a Ethambutol need not be included when the organism is known to be fully susceptible.\n\n【158】The minimum duration of treatment for culture-positive TB is 6 months. If PZA is not included in the initial phase, treatment should be given for 9 months. Smear-negative, culture-negative pulmonary TB may be treated successfully with 4 months of a combination INH-RIF regimen. Completion of anti-TB treatment is determined by both the total number of doses taken and the duration of therapy.\n\n【159】### Follow-up Evaluation\n\n【160】Patients receiving treatment for TB infection or disease should be counseled about adverse effects and should have clinical evaluations at least once monthly to assess adherence and evaluate for possible adverse effects of anti-TB medications . Patients receiving INH for LTBI therapy should be given no more than a 1-month drug supply and should be monitored monthly for drug-induced hepatotoxicity or other adverse effects.\n\n【161】Laboratory monitoring during treatment for LTBI is indicated only for patients with abnormal baseline liver function test results and other risks of liver disease and for evaluation of possible adverse effects during treatment.\n\n【162】Patients being treated for pulmonary TB should have sputum microscopy and culture performed at least once a month until 2 consecutive negative specimens are obtained. Sputum culture after 2 months of treatment is particularly important because a positive result is associated with increased risk of relapse\n\n【163】Rifapentine and isoniazid once a week versus rifampicin and isoniazid twice a week for treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-negative patients: a randomised clinical trial.\n\n【164】and requires 7 months of continuation therapy. Platelet counts and measurements of hepatic and renal function are necessary for those with baseline abnormalities or those at increased risk of toxicity (eg, hepatitis B or C infection, alcohol abuse).\n\n【165】When EMB is to be used, visual acuity and red-green color discrimination should be monitored.\n\n【166】Follow-up chest radiography after 2 months and at the completion of treatment is optional. Expert consultation should be sought for the management of patients who develop substantial adverse effects and require alternative treatment regimens.\n\n【167】TREATMENT IN SPECIAL SITUATIONS\n-------------------------------\n\n【168】### Infection With HIV\n\n【169】In general, the treatment of LTBI and TB in HIV-infected adults is the same as in adults not infected with HIV, with a few exceptions. Treatment for TB can be complicated by the interaction between rifamycins, antiretroviral agents, and other anti-infective drugs prescribed for opportunistic infections. In persons receiving antiretroviral therapy, RIF should be avoided or used with caution. Rifabutin, which has fewer problematic drug interactions, may be substituted for RIF. During the continuation phase of treatment, the INH-rifapentine regimen should never be used because of the high relapse rate.\n\n【170】Concurrent initiation of anti-TB and antiretroviral therapy may cause increased adverse effects and paradoxical reactions in patients not already receiving treatment. The term _immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome_ is used to describe this paradoxical reaction, which presents as worsening clinical (eg, high fever, weight loss, increased lymphadenopathy) and radiographic (eg, increased pulmonary infiltrates) manifestations of TB resulting from the immune reconstitution achieved by antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【171】Immune restoration disease after the treatment of immunodeficient HIV-infected patients with highly active antiretroviral therapy.\n\n【172】The mechanism for these paradoxical reactions is unclear but appears to be immune mediated: lower CD4 counts in patients with HIV infection seem to be associated with a higher risk of developing immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.\n\n【173】For these reasons, antiretroviral therapy should be delayed for 2 to 8 weeks after starting anti-TB therapy.\n\n【174】Treatment of HIV-related TB is complex and is best managed by those with expertise in both HIV infection and TB.\n\n【175】### Extrapulmonary TB\n\n【176】The same basic principles for the treatment of pulmonary TB apply to extrapulmonary TB. For TB at any site, a treatment course of 6 to 9 months with regimens that include INH and RIF is recommended; the single exception is meningitis, for which 9 to 12 months of treatment is recommended. The addition of corticosteroids to anti-TB treatment is recommended for patients with TB of the pericardium and central nervous system, including the meninges.\n\n【177】### Pregnancy and Breast-feeding\n\n【178】For the treatment of TB in pregnant women, the initial regimen should be INH, RIF, and EMB for at least 9 months. Although teratogenicity data for PZA are limited, it is probably safe to use in pregnancy. Breast-feeding should not be discouraged for women receiving anti-TB treatment. Pyridoxine supplementation (25 mg/d) is recommended for all pregnant and breast-feeding women taking INH.\n\n【179】### Drug-Resistant TB\n\n【180】Treatment of drug-resistant TB (resistance of the organism to 1 first-line drug) has become even more complex, difficult, and expensive with the emergence of MDR-TB and XDR-TB. Patients with drug-resistant TB may acquire further drug resistance and are at high risk of treatment failure.\n\n【181】Treatment outcomes for HIV-uninfected patients with multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.\n\n【182】These patients should receive prompt expert consultation. General guidelines for treating patients with drug-resistant TB include using multiple (4-6) drugs, including an injectable agent to which the organism is susceptible. Treatment includes second-line drugs that have many adverse effects and are more expensive and less effective than first-line drugs. Careful supervision under DOT is mandatory to ensure adherence to therapy. Treatment is extended to 24 months after culture conversion, with posttreatment follow-up for 24 months. Case series reveal a possible role for surgical therapy in select cases of MDR-TB and XDR-TB.\n\n【183】Surgical treatment for multidrug-resistant and extensive drug-resistant tuberculosis.\n\n【184】CONTROL AND ELIMINATION\n-----------------------\n\n【185】Active TB is frequently treated in the outpatient setting. Patients with active TB should be managed in conjunction with local public health offices and TB control agencies to coordinate visits and maximize adherence. When active TB is suspected, patients should wear a simple surgical mask when they are out of the house or near other people.\n\n【186】Initial treatment in the hospital may be appropriate for patients who are acutely ill, those with substantial comorbid illness, or infectious patients who are nonadherent to therapy.\n\n【187】These patients should be admitted to a negative-pressure isolation room with at least 6 air exchanges per hour.\n\n【188】Health care professionals should wear a fit-tested N95 mask; those who have not been fit-tested or are unable to use an N95 mask should use a powered air-purifying respirator. Simple surgical masks are more effective than N95 masks at preventing extrusion of respiratory droplets; therefore, patients with TB should wear a simple surgical mask when they are not in their isolation room. Patients may be removed from isolation when clinical improvement is seen on effective therapy and when 3 consecutive sputum samples on separate days are AFB smear–negative.\n\n【189】If patients with active pulmonary TB are medically stable for discharge but are not yet AFB smear–negative, they may be discharged only if a definitive plan for outpatient therapy has been coordinated with the local TB control agency, if no children younger than 4 years or no immunocompromised persons live with them, and if they agree to leave their home only for medical appointments.\n\n【190】The preferred mechanism of therapy for both inpatients and outpatients is DOT.\n\n【191】The effect of directly observed therapy on the rates of drug resistance and relapse in tuberculosis.\n\n【192】Treatment of patients with active TB is the top public health priority for TB control, followed by contact investigation of all persons who came into close contact with these patients before initiation of therapy. Such contact investigation should be carried out on all patients with confirmed active pulmonary TB and on selected patients with suspected pulmonary TB before testing is complete.\n\n【193】Patients with extrapulmonary TB are generally not infectious; therefore, contact investigation is not indicated.\n\n【194】The third priority for TB elimination and control is to reduce the population-based burden of LTBI through targeted testing and treatment. This strategy is particularly important in low-incidence nations, where most TB cases arise from reactivation of LTBI. In high-incidence, resource-poor settings, this strategy is rarely feasible. Testing for LTBI is indicated to detect patients at risk of new infection or at risk of reactivation of LTBI due to underlying medical conditions. Persons at risk of new infection include contacts of patients with active pulmonary TB, employees at facilities with a high risk of exposure (eg, prisons, health care facilities, homeless shelters), and those who have recently immigrated (ie, within the past 5 years) from regions of the world where TB is endemic. Persons at highest risk of reactivation include those taking immunosuppressive medications (ie, chemotherapy, tumor necrosis factor α inhibitors) and those with HIV infection, hematologic malignancy, silicosis, dialysis-dependent renal failure, or changes on chest radiography consistent with previous TB.\n\n【195】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【196】Tuberculosis remains a devastating disease throughout the world. Efforts to eradicate it have been thwarted by poverty, lack of health care access, drug resistance, immunosuppressed populations (eg, HIV-infected persons), and global migration. Effective management requires prompt recognition using a combination of clinical, radiographic, microbiological, and histopathologic hallmarks and initiation of appropriate multidrug therapy. In addition to effective treatment of patients with active TB, public health management strategies include contact investigation and testing of persons who came into close contact with patients with active TB before initiation of therapy and reduction of the population-based burden of LTBI through targeted testing and treatment.\n\n【197】CME Materials\n-------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Piecewise linear regression was used to evaluate the trends in the overall population and in subgroups.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Among 45,982 deaths due to MR during the study period, higher mortality rates were seen in older White females from the western United States. In 1999, the crude and age-adjusted mortality rates were 27.4 (95% CI, 26.3 to 28.4) and 27.5 (95% CI, 26.4 to 28.5) per 1,000,000 persons, respectively. By 2018, these rates declined to 18.0 (95% CI, 17.3 to 18.7) and 17.7 (95% CI, 17.0 to 18.4) per 1,000,000 persons, respectively ( _P_ <.001 for trend for both). Crude mortality rates declined from 1999 to 2012 (annual percentage change \\[APC\\], −4.1 (95% CI, −4.6 to −3.6) but then increased after 2012 (APC, 2.6 \\[95% CI, 0.8 to 4.4; _P_ <.001 for change in trend\\]). The age-adjusted mortality rates declined from 1999 to 2012 (APC, −3.9 \\[95% CI, −4.4 to −3.4\\]) but subsequently increased after 2012 (APC, 1.4 \\[95% CI, −0.4 to 3.2; _P_ <.001 for change in trend\\]). The observed decrease was consistent across age, sex, race, geographic region, and urbanization subgroups ( _P_ <.05 for all).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Mortality due to MR in American adults declined at an annual rate of approximately 4% until 2012 and has since then increased by about 1.5% annually.

However, in adjusted analysis, anticoagulation did not predict either a better or a worse outcome for primary outcomes (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.67-1.64; _P_ \\=.84) or for secondary outcomes (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.670-3.46; _P_ \\=.31). The benefit of anticoagulation was also not established in patients with LV thrombus (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.32-5.97; _P_ \\=.66).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In patients with ischemic LV aneurysms, oral anticoagulation therapy with warfarin may not be effective enough to reduce cardiac and cerebrovascular events including systemic embolism.

Although resistant gram-positive infections have been concerning to clinicians, the increasing incidence of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative infections has become the most pressing issue in bacterial resistance. Indiscriminate antimicrobial use in humans and animals coupled with increased global connectivity facilitated the transmission of gram-negative infections harboring extended-spectrum β-lactamases in the 1990s. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, such as those containing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamases, have been the latest scourge since the late 1990s to 2000s. Besides β-lactam resistance, these gram-negative infections are often resistant to multiple drug classes, including fluoroquinolones, which are commonly used to treat community-onset infections. In certain geographic locales, these pathogens, which have been typically associated with health care–associated infections, are disseminating into the community, posing a significant dilemma for clinicians treating community-onset infections. In this Concise Review, we summarize emerging trends in antimicrobial resistance. We also review the current knowledge on the detection, treatment, and prevention of infection with these organisms, with a focus on the carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli. Finally, we discuss emerging therapies and areas that need further research and effort to stem the spread of antimicrobial resistance.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】BLBLI ( β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor ), CPGNB ( carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli ), ESBL ( extended spectrum β-lactamase ), GNB ( gram-negative bacilli ), KPC ( Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase ), NDM ( New Delhi metallo-β-lactamases )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【6】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)._ <sup>TM </sup> Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【7】**Learning Objectives:** On completion of this article, you should be able to (1) recognize that antimicrobial resistance is a pressing global health concern, (2) appreciate the epidemiology, risk factors for, and the treatment of infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacilli, and (3) recognize that a holistic approach is required to combat the global spread of antimicrobial resistance.\n\n【8】**Disclosures:** As a provider accredited by ACCME, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine (Mayo School of Continuous Professional Development) must ensure balance, independence, objectivity, and scientiﬁc rigor in its educational activities.

Disclosure of this information will be published in course materials so that those participants in the activity may formulate their own judgments regarding the presentation.\n\n【9】Although antimicrobial resistance is complex and longstanding, what has recently and appropriately garnered attention is that the evolution of resistant microbes has outpaced the development of antibiotics. From the emergence of penicillin and methicillin resistance in _Staphylococcus aureus_ to vancomycin-resistant enterococci, we are now faced with the specter of resistant superbug gram-negative infections, some of which have become virtually untreatable.\n\n【10】Although resistant gram-positive infections have been of most concern, the spread of resistant gram-negative infections is currently the most pressing emerging issue in bacterial resistance. In this Concise Review, we present current knowledge with respect to the detection, treatment, and prevention of infection with these organisms, with a focus on the carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli (CPGNB). We also discuss emerging therapies and areas that need further efforts and research to stem the spread of antimicrobial resistance.\n\n【11】Why Should We Be Concerned?\n---------------------------\n\n【12】Antimicrobial resistance should concern clinicians for several important reasons. First, treatment options are limited and sometimes nonexistent. Among the Enterobacteriaceae (eg, _Escherichia coli, Klebsiella,_ and _Enterobacter_ ), the extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) mediate resistance to the first- through fourth-generation cephalosporins. The more recently developed carbapenemases, such as _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases (KPCs) and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamases (NDMs), also hydrolyze carbapenems, the preferred agents of the β-lactam class when treating serious ESBL gram-negative infections. Both ESBL and CPGNB often exhibit multiclass resistance. Non-Enterobacteriaceae gram-negative bacilli (GNB), such as _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Acinetobacter baumannii_ , are significant nosocomial pathogens found in the environment and on medical equipment that frequently possess multiple-resistance mechanisms beyond β-lactamases. These pathogens are especially problematic in intensive care units, where multi- or even pan-drug resistance is commonly encountered.\n\n【13】Second, resistance has spread widely on several fronts. On a biologic level, genes that encode resistance are often carried on plasmids, which are shared easily among the GNB, in particular the Enterobacteriaceae. This exchange of resistance genes can occur within a host\n\n【14】Outbreak of carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae containing blaNDM-1, Ontario, Canada.\n\n【15】and in the environment.\n\n【16】Gram-negative organisms, such as _E coli_ and _K pneumoniae,_ are important causes of community-onset and health care–associated infections, respectively, and these 2 species have been most frequently associated with ESBL and carbapenemase carriage. Geographically, resistant gram-negative infections have caused outbreaks on a locoregional level\n\n【17】Tracking a hospital outbreak of carbapenem-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ with whole-genome sequencing.\n\n【18】Emergence and rapid regional spread of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.\n\n【19】and also worldwide\n\n【20】Clinical epidemiology of the global expansion of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases.\n\n【21】 the latter facilitated by increased international travel and medical tourism. Currently, KPC is endemic in parts of the United States, certain Latin American countries (Colombia and Brazil), and the Mediterranean (Italy, Greece, and Israel), and NDM is endemic in the Indian subcontinent, Balkan States, North Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic outbreaks occurring in the United States.\n\n【22】In the Indian subcontinent, NDM has disseminated into the community and has been found in drinking water sources.\n\n【23】Household spread of KPC has also been reported.\n\n【24】Figure Distribution of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase (KPC), New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM), and OXA-48 group carbapenemases worldwide.\n\n【25】Third, dissemination and acquisition may be silent and pose significant challenges for infection control. Because the Enterobacteriaceae form part of the normal gut microbiota, individuals can be colonized asymptomatically and unknowingly serve as a reservoir for spread to others; a subset eventually develops infections due to these bacteria.\n\n【26】Tracking a hospital outbreak of carbapenem-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ with whole-genome sequencing.\n\n【27】Fourth, infections are associated with increased mortality and economic costs. A recent meta-analysis found that mortality was twice as high in patients with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia compared with those with bacteremia due to carbapenem-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae; mortality attributable to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infection was up to 44%.\n\n【28】A lack of initial, active antibiotic therapy is an independent predictor of mortality in infections caused by KPC-producing _K pneumoniae_ .\n\n【29】Predictors of mortality in patients with bloodstream infections caused by KPC-producing _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ and impact of appropriate antimicrobial treatment.\n\n【30】Overall, antimicrobial resistance is estimated to cost $55 billion in the United States yearly.\n\n【31】The ESBL _E coli_ and _Klebsiella_ species infection was found in a matched-cohort study to have an additional attributable cost of $16,450 per patient and a mean additional 9.7 days of hospitalization.\n\n【32】Similar findings have been described for KPC infections.\n\n【33】What Are the Mechanisms of β-Lactam Resistance in GNB?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】The mechanisms of resistance in GNB seem daunting, partly because of the alphabet soup and the somewhat arbitrary nature of β-lactamase nomenclature. A basic understanding, however, is necessary to appreciate the epidemiology, treatment options, and infection control implications. Several important definitions are reviewed in Table 1 . The Ambler classification system classifies β-lactamases into 4 groups (class A, B, C, and D) on the basis of their amino acid sequences and their active site .\n\n【35】Table 1 Definitions of Common Terms Used to Describe Resistant Gram-Negative Bacilli\n\n| β-lactam antibiotics: | These antibiotics comprise the penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems, which share the common basic chemical structure of a 4-member β-lactam ring. |\n| --- | --- |\n| β-lactamases: | These enzymes hydrolyze the β-lactam ring and inactivate the β-lactam class of antibiotics. |\n| Ambler classification: | This is a classification system for β-lactamases on the basis of their amino acid sequences and their active site residue. |\n| Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs): | These are broad-spectrum, Ambler class A β-lactamases, which hydrolyze the penicillins, and first- to fourth-generation cephalosporins, which are cefoxitin susceptible and are inhibited by the β-lactamase inhibitors (eg, clavulanate). |\n| Cephalosporinases: | ESBLs are technically cephalosporinases, but the term _cephalosporinase_ is generally reserved to describe Ambler class C AmpC β-lactamases, which are cefoxitin resistant, hydrolyze the penicillins and first to third-generation cephalosporins, and are not inhibited by the β-lactamase inhibitors, such as clavulanate. |\n| Carbapenemases: | These are broad-spectrum β-lactamases (usually Ambler class A, B, or D), which have the ability to hydrolyze carbapenems, in addition to the penicillins and also the first- to fourth-generation cephalosporins, although activity may vary depending on the exact type of carbapenemase. |\n| Carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli (CRGNB) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae vs carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacilli (CPGNB) and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae: | CPGNB are most often CRGNB (susceptibility testing may yield rare isolates and may have low carbapenem minimum inhibitory concentrations); however, not all CRGNB are carbapenemase producers. Carbapenem resistance may be mediated by ESBL or AmpC production, for example, associated with porin loss . The Enterobacteriaceae are a large family of gram-negative bacilli, which ferment glucose. Nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli (non-Enterobacteriaceae) include _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ and _Acinetobacter baumannii_ . |\n\n【37】Table 2 Characteristics of Important β-Lactamases and Potential Treatment Options\n\n【38】BLBLI = β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor; ESBL = extended-spectrum β-lactamases; KPC = Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase; NDM = New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase.\n\n| Enzyme | ESBL | AmpC | KPC | NDM | OXA-48 group |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Activity | ESBL | Cephalosporinases | Carbapenemases |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Ambler class | A | C | A | B | D |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Active site residue | Serine | Serine | Serine | Zinc | Serine |\n| Resistance gene location | Plasmid | Chromosomal (inherent in some genera, such as _Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter_ ), occasionally plasmid | Plasmid | Plasmid | Plasmid |\n| β-lactams inactivatedbOlder BLBLIs are amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ticarcillin-clavulanate.

Treatment needs to be individualized, considering susceptibility results, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors, infection site, and patient factors (allergies or intolerances). Note that the polymyxins are limited by nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity and have no activity against Proteus, Providencia, and Serratia. Tigecycline has no activity against Pseudomonas, Proteus, and Providencia, is a bacteriostatic agent, and achieves poor serum and urine levels; thus, it should not be used as monotherapy in bloodstream infections or in urinary tract infections. | CarbapenemsPossibly BLBLIs, such as piperacillin-tazobactam, in carefully select patients (low inoculum, nonsevere infections, such as cystitis) | Cefepime (in select patients, such as those needing only a short course of therapy, low-inoculum, nonsevere infections)Carbapenems | More data neededPolymyxins,tigecycline, and aminoglycosidesCombination treatment, consider including a carbapenemCystitis: fosfomycin (oral) nitrofurantoin | More data neededPolymyxins, tigecycline, and aminoglycosidesAztreonamdAztreonam is intrinsically active against the metallo-β-lactamases but often inactivated by the organism’s concomitantly produced ESBLs.

Novel BLBLIs, such as ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam-avibactam, have activity against ESBLs, AmpCs, and KPCs. Aztreonam-avibactam has activity against NDMs.\n\n【41】c Not all options have been listed. Treatment needs to be individualized, considering susceptibility results, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors, infection site, and patient factors (allergies or intolerances). Note that the polymyxins are limited by nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity and have no activity against _Proteus, Providencia_ , and _Serratia_ . Tigecycline has no activity against _Pseudomonas_ , _Proteus_ , and _Providencia_ , is a bacteriostatic agent, and achieves poor serum and urine levels; thus, it should not be used as monotherapy in bloodstream infections or in urinary tract infections.\n\n【42】d Aztreonam is intrinsically active against the metallo-β-lactamases but often inactivated by the organism’s concomitantly produced ESBLs. The aztreonam-avibactam combination, however, is expected to be active.\n\n【43】Class A enzymes include the ESBLs and KPC enzymes. These enzymes are most commonly found in Enterobacteriaceae and are usually plasmid-borne. The ESBLs hydrolyze penicillins, first- through fourth-generation cephalosporins, and aztreonam but may be inhibited by β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor (BLBLI) combinations, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate and piperacillin-tazobactam. Cephamycins such as cefoxitin also retain susceptibility despite these enzymes. However, in serious ESBL infections (eg, bacteremia or high-inoculum infections), BLBLIs may not be reliable, making the existing combination products unsuitable; therefore, carbapenems are the β-lactams of choice. In addition to possessing the hydrolytic activity of ESBLs, KPCs also hydrolyze carbapenems. Few choices are left for treatment because other resistant determinants (eg, to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides) are almost invariably cocarried on plasmids. Among the aminoglycosides, however, gentamicin seems to retain the most activity against the KPC producers.\n\n【44】Clinical epidemiology of the global expansion of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases.\n\n【45】Class B enzymes are metallo-β-lactamases and examples include NDM, imipenem (IMP), and Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM). Metallo-β-lactamases hydrolyze penicillins, first- through fourth-generation cephalosporins, BLBLIs, and the carbapenems. Of interest, the monobactam aztreonam retains activity. However, because most isolates coproduce ESBLs, aztreonam is usually rendered ineffective.\n\n【46】The class C enzymes are the cephalosporinases or AmpC enzymes. These enzymes are chromosomally encoded and inherent in species such as the MY SPACE organisms (M _organella,_ Y _ersinia,_ S _erratia,_ Pseudomonas _/_ P _roteus/_ P _rovidencia,_ A _eromonas/_ A _cinetobacter,_ C _itrobacter_ , and E _nterobacter_ species). In some of these (eg, _Enterobacter, Serratia_ , and _Citrobacter_ ), AmpC can become induced during treatment with cephalosporins. Organisms initially testing susceptible to cephalosporins (eg, ceftriaxone) may develop resistance during treatment with this class. This is an important point for clinicians to note and especially a problem with _Enterobacter_ species; one study with 213 isolates found that 38% possessed inducible AmpC.\n\n【47】The use of cefepime for treating AmpC β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.\n\n【48】AmpCs are sometimes plasmid encoded and also inducible but sporadically found in other Enterobacteriaceae; one study in 70 sites and 25 US states found an incidence of plasmid-borne AmpC to be 4% in _E coli_ and 8.5% in _K pneumonia_ .\n\n【49】AmpCs hydrolyze the penicillins, first- to third-generation cephalosporins, BLBLIs, and aztreonam. Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, is poorly hydrolyzed by AmpCs, so many isolates test susceptible, and cefepime may be effective as treatment. In high-inoculum or serious infections, however, carbapenems are generally considered to be more reliable.\n\n【50】Class D enzymes are oxacillinases or OXA enzymes, so named because of their high hydrolytic activity against oxacillin. They are, however, a very diverse group, with some members being narrow-spectrum β-lactamases and others including carbapenemase activity. Unlike class A enzymes, they are not inhibited by the β-lactamase inhibitors. More recently, the OXA-48 group has emerged to become a predominant carbapenemase in some Mediterranean countries with sporadic cases reported in the United States.\n\n【51】This group is plasmid borne, has disseminated among Enterobacteriaceae (predominantly _K pneumoniae_ , unlike the other OXA types), and has been implicated in multiple nosocomial outbreaks.\n\n【52】Of note, carbapenem resistance does not always necessarily stem from carbapenemase production. Isolates that are ESBL or AmpC producers when coupled with a porin loss may be resistant to carbapenems. Porins are protein channels that allow entry of solutes into the bacterial cell, including antibiotics. Resistance to carbapenems may also result from efflux pumps, which extrude antibiotics from the bacterial cell.\n\n【53】Why Are ESBL and CPGNB Often Resistant to Other (Non–β-Lactam) Drug Classes?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【54】Plasmids encoding β-lactamases often carry other antibiotic-resistance genes, for example, enzymes that modify antibiotic targets (eg, ribosomal RNA methylation conferring high-level aminoglycoside resistance), or antibiotics themselves (eg, acetyltransferases modifying quinolones and aminoglycosides). Plasmids can also encode various efflux pumps that extrude not only β-lactams but also quinolones, aminoglycosides, and tetracyclines.\n\n【55】Who Is at Risk for Acquiring Resistant GNB?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【56】Risk factors for acquiring ESBL and CPGNB include prior and recent antibiotic use, residence in long-term acute care facilities, admission to an intensive care unit, presence of indwelling medical devices or wounds, poor functional status, increased age, solid organ or stem cell transplant, and receipt of health care in or travel to endemic areas.\n\n【57】In addition, resistance to a particular antibiotic may not necessarily be associated with exposure to antibiotics from the same class but may follow exposure to other classes. For example, one study on _Acinetobacter baumannii_ bacteremia found that fluoroquinolone exposure was associated strongly with carbapenem-resistant isolates; this association could be due to activation of intrinsic mechanisms of resistance (eg, efflux pumps).\n\n【58】How Are Infections With Resistant GNB Diagnosed?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【59】Diagnosis of infection is via culture of clinical specimens with bacterial identification and susceptibility testing. Most isolates have a susceptibility pattern with a typical ESBL or CPGNB phenotype .\n\n【60】Confirmatory testing for ESBL or carbapenemase production can be performed for infection control purposes but is not currently routinely recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. The CPGNB isolates may sometimes test susceptible (using clinical breakpoints) to one or more of the extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and/or cefepime) and only have modest increases in carbapenem minimum inhibitory concentrations; this is especially a problem with the OXA-48–producing isolates. Confirmation of ESBL or carbapenemase production typically comprises a phenotypic test (eg, a double disk diffusion test for ESBLs and the modified Hodge test, Carba NP test, or other inhibitor-based tests for carbapenemases) or a molecular test, which typically is a polymerase chain reaction assay for a specific resistance gene encoding the β-lactamase (eg, KPC and NDM).\n\n【61】Comparison of a novel, rapid chromogenic biochemical assay, the Carba NP test, with the modified Hodge test for detection of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli.\n\n【62】Identification of colonized patients is important as part of infection control because asymptomatic carriage is a reservoir for further propagation. Patients at risk may include those who have had direct contact with another actively infected or colonized patient, patients transferred from other facilities (especially long-term care facilities), or those who have been hospitalized overseas within the past 6 months.

Expert consultation with an infectious disease specialist is recommended. Carbapenems are the treatment of choice for invasive or high-inoculum infections caused by ESBL and AmpC producers. For CPGNB, treatment options are even more limited. Often the polymyxin (colistin or polymyxin B), tigecycline, and sometimes select aminoglycosides are the only active agents . The polymyxins are limited by nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity and have no activity against _Proteus, Providencia_ , _Morganella_ , and _Serratia_ . We have only started to understand how to optimize the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of these agents. Tigecycline has no activity against _Pseudomonas_ , _Proteus_ , _Providencia_ , and _Morganella._ In addition, it is a bacteriostatic agent, achieves poor serum and urine levels, and thus should not be used as monotherapy in bloodstream or urinary tract infections. Other legacy antimicrobials, such as oral fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin, can be used if found to be active, but their use is generally limited to lower urinary tract infections. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or the quinolones may also be used if these test susceptible, but this is uncommon. For the acutely ill or septic patient, empiric therapy with agents active against ESBL and CPGNB may have to be considered if the patient possesses appropriate risk factors; clinicians should also take into account the local epidemiology of ESBL and CPGNB in their area of practice. A local hospital antibiogram can be very helpful in this respect. State or public health departments may also publish such data and be a useful resource.\n\n【73】Data from prospective, randomized trials are lacking for combination therapy for CPGNB; however, in vitro studies and accumulated retrospective experience suggest that, at least for KPC infections, combination therapy, including a carbapenem (eg, polymyxin-carbapenem or aminoglycoside-carbapenem), may have a mortality benefit.\n\n【74】Predictors of mortality in bloodstream infections caused by _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase-producing _K. pneumoniae_ : importance of combination therapy.\n\n【75】Extended infusions with carbapenems may be considered to increase the probability of achieving optimal bactericidal killing, although more data from randomized trials are needed.\n\n【76】Clinical data are scant for treatment of OXA-48 and NDM infections; a recent retrospective, observational study suggested that for bacteremia from OXA-48 producers, combination therapy that included colistin produced a mortality benefit.\n\n【77】Blood stream infections due to OXA-48-like carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae: treatment and survival.\n\n【78】Clearly, new and effective agents are needed for CPGNB infections, and recent stimuli for development, such as the Generating Antibiotics Incentives Now Act, are much welcomed initiatives. Avibactam is a novel β-lactamase inhibitor furthest along in development and expected to be introduced into clinical use soon. It has good activity against KPCs when combined with ceftazidime, and although it does not intrinsically inhibit metallo-β-lactamases, it has potent activity against metallo-β-lactamases, such as NDM, when combined with aztreonam.\n\n【79】In vitro activities of ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam-avibactam against 372 Gram-negative bacilli collected in 2011 and 2012 from 11 teaching hospitals in China.\n\n【80】Activities of NXL104 combinations with ceftazidime and aztreonam against carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae.\n\n【81】How Are Resistant Gram-Negative Infections Prevented?\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【82】A proactive approach to combating antimicrobial resistance should take place on the prescriber and local level and on the regional or national and international level.\n\n【83】### Prescriber and Local Level\n\n【84】#### Health Care Worker Education\n\n【85】In a study by Giblin et al,\n\n【86】Clinicians' perceptions of the problem of antimicrobial resistance in health care facilities.\n\n【87】clinicians were more likely to believe that antimicrobial resistance was a problem nationally than at their own practice or institution. It is difficult to engage physicians and other health care workers when they do not believe a problem exists. Hard data should be presented and made readily accessible (eg, via Web portals), such as a local antibiogram (ideally stratified for both inpatient and outpatients) and local hand hygiene or isolation precautions adherence rates. A local antibiogram is essential to facilitate rational empiric antibiotic prescribing. Education of health care professionals is important and should begin during initial training and be featured regularly as part of ongoing education programs. Special efforts should be targeted toward the greatest barriers identified in one’s local context. In the study by Giblin et al, for example, the chief barriers were identified as (1) resisting the urge to treat colonization rather than true infection, (2) discontinuing use of antimicrobials when infection is cured or unlikely, and (3) practicing antimicrobial control.\n\n【88】#### Infection Control and Antimicrobial Stewardship\n\n【89】Such efforts should be spearheaded by multidisciplinary teams (involving physicians, pharmacists, microbiologists, and nurses). Antimicrobial stewardship should extend beyond inpatients to the outpatient setting (including emergency departments), where most patients are seen.\n\n【90】#### Active Surveillance and Interrupting the Chain of Transmission\n\n【91】Active surveillance of at-risk patients should be part of routine infection control activities—a bundled approach, including early detection, isolation and cohorting, and skin decontamination in select patient groups (eg, daily chlorhexidine bathing) can help interrupt the chain of transmission.\n\n【92】Successful control of an outbreak of _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemase-producing _K. pneumoniae_ at a long-term acute care hospital.\n\n【93】Novel approaches may help in decreasing environmental contamination (eg, adenosine triphosphate bioluminescence or UV monitoring for effectiveness of environmental cleaning, hydrogen peroxide vapor decontamination,\n\n【94】and use of copper-coated surfaces\n\n【95】Antimicrobial activity of copper surfaces against carbapenemase-producing contemporary Gram-negative clinical isolates.\n\n【96】); however, more studies will be needed to validate and standardize such approaches, keeping in mind that each method has inherent limitations. Laboratories, depending on local hospital epidemiology, should determine the optimal method for CPGNB screening and be aware that no one method is perfect (molecular methods only detect resistance targets identified in the assay, whereas phenotypic methods may be less sensitive overall and are generally more labor intensive).\n\n【97】### Regional or National and International Level\n\n【98】#### Information Sharing\n\n【99】Given the potential for rapid regional dissemination of resistant GNB with increased interfacility transfers for medical care, novel methods to accurately identify patients who are at risk of or who are known CPGNB carriers during transfer of care will help ensure that appropriate infection control measures will be continued. Regional antimicrobial surveillance networks, such as the Healthcare-Associated Infections-Community Interface, European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network, and Asian Network for Surveillance of Resistant Pathogens, play an important role in providing necessary data for policy making and resource allocation.\n\n【100】#### Decrease in Nonhuman Use of Antimicrobials\n\n【101】Currently, only the European Union has banned (since 2006) the use of antibiotics for nontherapeutic uses in farm animals. It has been estimated that 80% of antimicrobial use in the United States is for nontherapeutic uses in livestock. Further inroads globally should be made into regulating such use because this has been linked to antimicrobial-resistant human infections.\n\n【102】Antimicrobial resistance: a global view from the 2013 World Healthcare-Associated Infections Forum.\n\n【103】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【104】Antimicrobial resistance, in particular resistant GNB, is a formidable threat to human health. Although the climate for the development of novel, active agents against CPGNB has improved somewhat in recent years, and indeed several new agents are in the pipeline, these agents will most certainly not be a panacea. A holistic approach must be embraced, including continued health care professional education, attention to infection control, adoption of new technologies and algorithms in screening, diagnosing and interrupting the chain of infection, antimicrobial stewardship in both humans and animals, and greater regional and international collaboration.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Following high school graduation in Prostějov, he studied chemistry at the Chemical and Technological Faculty of the Czech Technical University in Prague, graduating in 1936. He continued at the University and completed a doctoral thesis in chemistry in 1939. However, he was not allowed to continue at the University after 1939, because Germany had seized Czechoslovakia and considered Wichterle “politically unreliable.”\n\n【1】Wichterle was able to obtain work in a research institute at the Bat'a Shoe Company in Zlin, where he continued his investigations in the chemistry of plastics. Two years later he developed a procedure to make a synthetic polyamide fiber named _silon_ , which was similar to nylon − that had been discovered in 1938 in the United States − but of which Wichterle was unaware. He was imprisoned by the Gestapo in 1942 for a few months but then released. Following World War II, he returned to the Czech Technical University, where he taught organic and inorganic chemistry, and wrote popular textbooks in both fields. He obtained a second doctorate in 1949 on the technology of plastics. Three years later, at age 39, he became Dean of the newly established Institute of Chemical Technology in Prague, but was forced to vacate his position after a political purge by Czechoslovakia's Communist leadership in 1958.\n\n【2】That same year, a research center for synthetic polymers named Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences was established with Wichterle as director. He was known as a fine mentor and once told his students, “Those of you who do not know more about your project than your supervisor within one year should leave at that time. Your supervisor has about ten graduate students and many other duties. You would not like to admit that you are ten times less efficient.”\n\n【3】He worked on the synthesis of cross-linked hydrophilic gels in order to find a material suitable for permanent contact with living tissues. This work resulted in a gel, poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), which absorbed up to 40% of water and was non-irritating. By Christmas 1961, he had succeeded in producing four hydrogel contact lenses with an instrument made from a child's building kit (similar to an erector set) and a phonograph motor. These were to be the world's first soft lenses. (Hard lenses made of glass had been developed in the 1880s and were succeeded by hard Plexiglas lenses in the 1930s.) He first tried the lenses in his own eyes and found that they were comfortable. He then developed a centrifugal casting procedure to mass produce lenses by spin casting. The US National Patent Development Corporation (NPDC) bought the American rights for production of the new lenses from the Czechoslovak government for $330,000 and then sublicensed the patent to the Bausch and Lomb Corporation.\n\n【4】Wichterle became well known because of his international activities, including presentations at congresses of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry. He filed approximately 180 patents pertaining to his work in organic synthesis, polymerization, production methods, and measuring devices.\n\n【5】He was expelled from the Institute of Macromolecular Chemistry in 1970 because he had signed “The Two Thousand Words,” a manifesto supporting continuation of the democratization that had begun during the Prague Spring of 1968. He resumed his scientific activities following the Velvet Revolution in 1989, and he was later elected president of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. An asteroid (#3899) was named after Wichterle in 1993.\n\n【6】According to his grandson, Wichterle received no more than one-tenth of 1% of what the Czechoslovak government had been paid for his patent rights for contact lenses. However, he did not complain and never regretted not gaining wealth from his inventions. He led a comfortable life and enjoyed traveling and visiting other scientists throughout the world. During the last year of his life he had a heart attack and a stroke, and died in his sleep on August 18, 1998. He was honored on a postage stamp (Scott #3590) issued October 16, 2013, by the Czech Republic to commemorate the 100 <sup>th </sup> anniversary of his birth.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The primary care clinician is critically involved in the pharmacologic management of AF, whether it be direct prescription of AADs or managing potential drug-drug interactions with other medications. In this review, we provide instructive, high-yield clinical scenarios and quick clinical references to increase familiarity and comfort with the use of AADs.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AAD ( antiarrhythmic drug ), AF ( atrial fibrillation ), AV ( atrioventricular ), CCB ( calcium channel blocker ), CYP ( cytochrome P450 ), ECG ( electrocardiography ), LBBB ( left bundle branch block ), TdP ( torsades de pointes )\n\n【4】**Article Highlights**\n\n【5】*   •\n\n【6】    Overview of sodium and potassium channel blocker anti-arrhytmic drugs\n\n【7】*   •\n\n【8】    Common drug-drug interactions, including cytochrome P450 interactions and QT prolongation\n\n【9】*   •\n\n【10】    Considerations in renal and hepatic dysfunction\n\n【11】*   •\n\n【12】    Approach to initiation appropriate anti-arrhythmic agent based on patient conditions\n\n【13】*   •\n\n【14】    Case-based approach to highlight common scenarios and clinical pearls\n\n【15】Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common atrial arrhythmia. Its prevalence is expected to double, with estimates of approximately 33.5 million people being affected worldwide.\n\n【16】Worldwide epidemiology of atrial fibrillation: a Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study.\n\n【17】In addition to general cardiologists and cardiac electrophysiologists, the primary care clinician is critically involved in the long-term management of these patients. This includes drug initiation, monitoring, and discontinuation. As more patients develop AF and are treated with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) along with a concomitant escalation of comorbidities with aging, disease complexity and polypharmacy inevitably increase. The management of AADs in AF can seem daunting, given their potentially lethal adverse effect profile, which includes the potential for proarrhythmia and multiple drug-drug interactions.\n\n【18】As recent data have shown improved patient outcomes with the maintenance of sinus rhythm, it is to be expected that more patients will be prescribed these agents.\n\n【19】Effect of catheter ablation vs antiarrhythmic drug therapy on mortality, stroke, bleeding, and cardiac arrest among patients with atrial fibrillation: the CABANA randomized clinical trial.\n\n【20】Early rhythm-control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【21】Trials conducted since the early 2000s had not demonstrated a superiority of rhythm control over rate control in managing patients with AF.\n\n【22】A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【23】Randomized trial of rate-control versus rhythm-control in persistent atrial fibrillation: the Strategies of Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (STAF) study.\n\n【24】In specific subsets of patients, such as AF and heart failure, AF ablation has been shown to improve left ventricular systolic function.\n\n【25】Studies have also depicted a lower risk of stroke in patients treated with rhythm control compared with rate control.\n\n【26】Rhythm versus rate control therapy and subsequent stroke or transient ischemic attack in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【27】More recent literature from a large randomized controlled trial revealed that early rhythm control within 1 year of AF diagnosis reduced the composite primary outcome of cardiovascular death, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, or acute coronary syndrome at a 5-year follow-up.\n\n【28】Early rhythm-control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【29】It is anticipated that more patients with AF will have AADs as part of their treatment regimen in an attempt to maintain sinus rhythm. In this review, we present an instructive combination of familiar and high-yield clinical case scenarios the primary care clinician will commonly see in the outpatient setting along with drug-related clinical pearls. To guide our readers, a simple general conceptual schema for the use of AADs in AF is provided in Figure 1 . These are presented in a fashion to enhance familiarity with and safety of AADs and to afford comfort and confidence with management and surveillance of these agents.\n\n【30】Figure 1 Simplified schema for an antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) approach for atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. General considerations are described for both rate and rhythm control, adapted from the 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association atrial fibrillation guidelines.\n\n【31】2019 AHA/ACC/HRS focused update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society.\n\n【32】Note that many of the decisions on which antiarrhythmic drugs can or should be used are based on presence of either reduced ejection fraction or other structural heart disease and ischemia. Purple boxes indicate non–first-line agents. ∗On the basis of new data from the EAST-AFNET 4 trial, consider rhythm control in the first year, particularly for those with additional cardiovascular comorbidities. ∗∗Sotalol can be considered in patients with ischemic heart disease without heart failure. BB, beta blocker; CCB, calcium channel blocker; EF, ejection fraction; GDMT, guideline-directed medical therapy; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.\n\n【33】Atenolol: a Dated Drug With Potential Dangers in the Elderly\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】An 82-year-old man with a past medical history of AF and hypertension presents with symptoms of fatigue. He weighs 65 kg; blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg, and electrocardiography (ECG) shows second-degree type I atrioventricular (AV) block. Laboratory studies reveal a creatinine concentration of 1.5 mg/dL (to convert mg/dL to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4). He has been treated with atenolol for AF rate control and hypertension for the past 25 years.\n\n【35】### Atenolol Use in Elderly Patients\n\n【36】Atenolol was a popular beta blocker widely used in the 1980s and 1990s for both hypertension and migraine prevention. Atenolol has continued to be prescribed to many patients despite numerous trials showing that it is an inferior antihypertensive agent and that there is an increased risk of death in the elderly compared with other blood pressure drugs.\n\n【37】Like other sinus and AV nodal–blocking agents, it is associated with a risk of sinus node dysfunction and advanced degrees of heart block. It is renally excreted, and elderly patients with declining renal function are at greater risk from the adverse effects of atenolol.\n\n【38】#### Resolution\n\n【39】Because of his fatigue and second-degree type I AV block, you discontinue atenolol to see whether symptoms improve after drug washout. If he requires rate-controlling agents in the future, you plan to use metoprolol and to up-titrate as needed with a lenient rate control strategy for a target heart rate in AF of less than 110 beats/min.\n\n【40】Lenient versus strict rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【41】You recommend an antihypertensive without beta-blocker properties, such as amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide. You continue to monitor for signs of syncope or presyncope and other signs suggestive of sinus pauses or high-grade AV block.\n\n【42】Digoxin: an Old Drug to Be Used With Caution in AF and Heart Failure\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】A 69-year-old man presents with fatigue and nausea. He has a history of AF and heart failure and is receiving digoxin in addition to guideline-directed medical therapy. He has a creatinine concentration of 2.1 mg/dL and a digoxin level of 2.0 ng/L (upper limit of normal for the treatment of AF; to convert ng/L to nmol/L, multiply by 1.281). ECG shows junctional rhythm at 85 beats/min.\n\n【44】### Digoxin Use in AF and Heart Failure\n\n【45】In heart failure, digoxin improves myocardial contractility. It increases vagal tone and slowing of the AV node, resulting in decreased ventricular rates. Whereas it has not been shown to improve mortality (with some studies suggesting increased mortality), it has been shown to improve symptoms and to reduce hospitalizations in patients with heart failure.\n\n【46】Digoxin and mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【47】Despite being commonly used in the past, it is no longer considered first-line therapy for either indication, especially in those with reduced kidney function and in the elderly.\n\n【48】2019 AHA/ACC/HRS focused update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society.\n\n【49】However, in a 2020 trial (Rate Control Therapy Evaluation in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation \\[RATE-AF\\]) in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, digoxin was shown to improve symptoms and to reduce N-terminal pro–B type natriuretic peptide levels compared with a beta blocker (bisoprolol), indicating a potential shift in favor of digoxin in this particular population of patients.\n\n【50】It is possible that the drug may again be more widely used, and thus the primary care clinician needs to be aware of the risks of digoxin, especially in elderly patients.\n\n【51】### Monitoring of the Patient Receiving Digoxin\n\n【52】Digoxin has a relatively narrow therapeutic window. For heart failure alone, the target serum levels should be between 0.5 and 1.0 ng/L. For AF, the target range is higher (0.5-2.0 ng/L).\n\n【53】It is primarily excreted by the kidneys and should be used carefully in patients with chronic kidney disease. Digoxin toxic effects may be manifested as nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, visual disturbance, and characteristic electrocardiographic changes (such as atrial tachycardia, AV block, junctional rhythms, regularized AF). Digoxin effect, which is due to therapeutic digoxin therapy and not necessarily related to toxicity, can be seen as characteristic “sagging” ST segments . Of note, discontinuation of digoxin in stable patients may be associated with an increased risk of heart failure hospitalizations.\n\n【54】Figure 2 Electrocardiogram showing significant digoxin effect. Note the sagging ST segments prominent in the lateral leads (I, aVL, V5, and V6).\n\n【55】#### Resolution\n\n【56】You admit the patient to the hospital for cardiac monitoring and discontinue digoxin. Digoxin immune antibody is given with resolution of arrhythmia and symptoms.\n\n【57】Amiodarone: the Most Effective AAD With the Potential for Most Adverse Effects\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【58】A 75-year-old man presents to clinic for routine follow-up after repeated hospitalizations for AF with rapid ventricular rates. The patient is nervous because he has read about many issues with long-term amiodarone use. He wants to know about the potential adverse effects, monitoring, and drugs to avoid.\n\n【59】### Potential Adverse Effects of Amiodarone\n\n【60】Amiodarone is a highly lipid soluble molecule with a long half-life (25-100 days). Long-term amiodarone use can be associated with numerous adverse effects, and thus active surveillance is required. The most important toxic effects are hepatic (elevated liver enzyme activities in 15%-30% and cirrhosis in <3%), cardiac (QT prolongation or AV block), thyroid (hypothyroidism in 6% or hyperthyroidism in 0.9%-2.0%), pulmonary (interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in 1%-17%), ocular (corneal deposits in >90% or optic neuritis in <2%), and skin (photosensitivity in 25%-75% or blue-gray discoloration in 4%-9%). Some of these can occur early within months (ie, toxic effects in the lung, liver, and thyroid), whereas others may take years to be manifested and occur in a cumulative dose-dependent fashion.\n\n【61】### Monitoring of the Patient Receiving Long-term Amiodarone Therapy\n\n【62】If amiodarone use is longer than 3 months, the following baseline tests should be obtained: ECG for QT prolongation (avoid if QTc >500 milliseconds) and AV block (avoid if second-degree type II or greater); thyroid function test; liver function test; pulmonary function test; chest radiograph; formal ophthalmologic examination; and initial skin examination. Thyroid and liver function testing should be performed every 6 months. ECG, chest radiography, eye examination, and pulmonary function testing may be repeated every 6 to 12 months. All other testing should be repeated as symptoms dictate.\n\n【63】2019 AHA/ACC/HRS focused update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society.\n\n【64】The adverse effects and monitoring recommendations are summarized in Figure 3 . If there is any concern for toxic effect, amiodarone should be stopped immediately.\n\n【65】Figure 3 Major adverse effects of amiodarone and monitoring strategy. Frequency of monitoring examinations and testing may also depend on the patient’s clinical status and comorbidities. Amiodarone should be discontinued if any adverse effects are suspected. ALT, alanine transaminase; AST, aspartate transaminase; AV, atrioventricular; ECG, electrocardiography; PFT, pulmonary function testing; SA, sinoatrial; TSH, thyroid-stimulating hormone.\n\n【66】### Drug Interactions With Amiodarone\n\n【67】Amiodarone interacts with many commonly used cardiovascular medications, generally resulting in the need for closer monitoring, dose reduction, or medication discontinuation. These medications include warfarin, digoxin, calcium channel blockers (CCBs; diltiazem, verapamil), and certain statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin). The doses of warfarin and digoxin should be decreased by 50% when amiodarone is started if patients are receiving these agents.\n\n【68】A more comprehensive list of potential drug interactions in regard to hepatic metabolism through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system is shown in Table 1 . Medications that reduce heart rate, such as beta blockers and CCBs, may require closer monitoring. This is because amiodarone also reduces heart rate by its intrinsic beta-blocker effects.\n\n【69】Table 1 Cytochrome P450 Metabolism of AADs and Other Common Drugs\n\n|  | CYP2C9 | CYP2D6 | CYP3A4 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Outpatient AADs | Amiodarone | AmiodaroneCarvedilolFlecainideMetoprololMexiletinePropranololPropafenone | AmiodaroneDiltiazemDofetilideLidocaineVerapamil |\n| Drugs with potential interactions | Warfarin | Antipsychotics (haloperidol, risperidone)SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine)SNRIs (duloxetine, venlafaxine)TCAsOpioids (hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone)TrazadoneMirtazapine | Statin (simvastatin, atorvastatin, lovastatin) |\n\n【71】AADs, antiarrhythmic drugs, CYP, cytochrome P450; SNRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; SSRIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; TCAs, tricyclic antidepressants.\n\n【72】### Dronedarone\n\n【73】Dronedarone has been touted as “amiodarone with fewer toxicities” because of its lack of iodine. Theoretically, this reduces the risk of thyroid toxic effects. There are many situations in which its use is contraindicated, however. It should not be used in renal failure. It should be avoided in patients with persistent AF without plans for restoration of sinus rhythm and in patients with decompensated heart failure. In short, dronedarone still requires monitoring; it can be used in certain clinical situations, although efficacy remains questionable.\n\n【74】#### Resolution\n\n【75】You discuss this with the patient. He understands the risks and rationale for the use of amiodarone and agrees to surveillance testing. You advise him to contact you with any symptoms that you have noted.\n\n【76】Flecainide and Propafenone (Sodium Channel Blockers; Class I AADS): Strategies for Patients With Structurally Normal Hearts\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【77】A 32-year-old male athlete presents to your clinic for follow-up after numerous cardioversions in the emergency department for AF with rapid ventricular response. After cardioversion, he had always been prescribed anticoagulation. Previous echocardiograms have shown a structurally normal heart. He wants to learn about the “pill-in-pocket” approach to treating AF. He asks what to monitor when it is being initiated, how to use it, and whether he needs to be receiving anticoagulation.\n\n【78】### Mechanism of Action of Flecainide and Propafenone\n\n【79】Flecainide and propafenone are sodium channel blockers, both of which are commonly used for AF. They are oral medications that can be taken in a scheduled twice-daily dose for long-term AF prevention and suppression or in a so-called as-needed pill-in-pocket dosing approach for episodes.\n\n【80】Both medications should be avoided in patients with preexisting ischemic or structural heart disease (which includes left ventricular hypertrophy as well as significant valve disease).\n\n【81】The decision on when and how to use these agents is shown in Figure 4 .\n\n【82】Figure 4 Flow diagram for consideration of flecainide or propafenone for atrial fibrillation (AF). The strategy for selection of the pill-in-pocket or daily dosing approach should be made in consideration of frequency of symptoms, presence of reliable symptoms, and patient’s preference. BB, beta blocker; BID, twice daily; CCB, calcium channel blocker; ECG, electrocardiography; TID, three times daily; TTE, transthoracic echocardiography.\n\n【83】### Pill-in-Pocket Strategy: Monitoring and Initiation\n\n【84】Baseline ECG is necessary to determine baseline QRS duration and any evidence of conduction system disease. Baseline echocardiography should also be performed to evaluate for structural heart disease. Initiation should occur in a monitored setting, in either the emergency department or hospital, both to ensure efficacy and to monitor QRS duration for the first dose. Once safety and efficacy have been established, the pill-in-pocket strategy is used on an as-needed basis to terminate AF, with instructions on the maximum dose per 24 hours.\n\n【85】Clinical effectiveness of a systematic \"pill-in-the-pocket\" approach for the management of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\n\n【86】This requires patients to have reliable symptomatic palpitations when AF occurs to know when to take the drug.\n\n【87】### Scheduled Daily Dosing and Stress Testing\n\n【88】For patients with twice-daily scheduled dosing, treadmill ECG to specifically monitor for QRS duration widening, atrial flutter, or ventricular arrhythmias should be performed 1 to 2 weeks after this agent is started. These medications exhibit “use dependence,” which means that there is a greater drug effect at faster heart rates. Stress testing before starting of these agents should be done to rule out ischemia if there is suspicion for underlying coronary artery disease as propafenone and flecainide are contraindicated in these patients. QRS widening with ventricular arrhythmias on treadmill ECG should prompt discontinuation.\n\n【89】### Anticoagulation\n\n【90】The decision as to whether to start anticoagulation should be based on time in AF and CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score, which is used to estimate risk of ischemic stroke. In general, patients with reliable symptoms of AF for less than 24 hours with a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score of less than 2 are considered low risk and may not need long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【91】Transesophageal echocardiography is often used to rule out thrombus before initiation of an AAD, especially if the time in AF is unknown and if the patient had not previously received anticoagulation with an elevated CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score. If direct current cardioversion is performed, anticoagulation should be continued for a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks after cardioversion regardless of risk score and continued indefinitely in those with a risk score of 2 or more.\n\n【92】### Important Medication Considerations and Drug Interactions\n\n【93】When flecainide or propafenone is started with either approach, it is important also to start a low dose of either a beta blocker or a CCB to prevent the development of atrial flutter with rapid 1:1 conduction, a rhythm that can produce heart rates above 200 beats/min.\n\n【94】Both medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and thus have many important drug interactions . It is important for clinicians to be aware of these important interactions. Key points for use of sodium channel blockers for AF are summarized in Table 2 .\n\n【95】Table 2 Key Summary Points for Sodium Channel Blockers (Vaughan-Williams Class Ic)\n\n| Flecainide or propafenone |\n| --- |\n| • Always administer the medication in combination with a low-dose beta blocker or CCB to avoid atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction. |\n| • The medication is able to be taken as needed by a “pill-in-pocket” dosing strategy for paroxysmal AF with reliable symptoms. |\n| • The drug is most efficacious at higher heart rates; perform treadmill ECG within 1-2 weeks of initiation to evaluate for widening of QRS or ventricular arrhythmia, particularly for daily dosing. |\n| • Avoid in structural heart disease (eg, > mild valve disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), prior heart attack, or active ischemia. |\n\n【97】AF, atrial fibrillation; CCB, calcium channel blocker; ECG, electrocardiography.\n\n【98】#### Resolution\n\n【99】You advise him to consider both strategies. If he were to choose to start pill-in-pocket flecainide or propafenone, he would need to take the first dose in a monitored setting, with a beta blocker or CCB taken 30 minutes before the first dose. If he chooses the scheduled dosing approach, he will need treadmill ECG 1 to 2 weeks after initiation. You defer long-term anticoagulation at this time, given that his CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score is 0.\n\n【100】Dofetilide (Potassium Channel Blocker; Class III AAD): Strategy for Structural Heart Disease or Heart Failure\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【101】A 75-year-old woman with hypertension presents for AF management. She is already taking dofetilide, which was initiated in the hospital setting. She has normal renal function, and her QTc with this agent is 474 milliseconds. Of note, she required a stay of 2 extra days in the hospital before starting this drug because she was taking hydrochlorothiazide. The additional days were needed to allow the hydrochlorothiazide to be stopped and washed out of her system before starting of dofetilide. She asks about the dangers of taking this medication and what can increase this risk.\n\n【102】### Mechanism of Dofetilide and the Concerns With QTc Prolongation\n\n【103】Dofetilide is a potassium channel blocker commonly used in AF. It exhibits reverse-use dependence, which means that the drug is more potent at slower heart rates.\n\n【104】Dofetilide requires inpatient initiation because of the potential for significant QT prolongation. ECG should be performed every 6 months to monitor the QTc interval. Dose reduction or termination may be indicated, depending on renal function, heart failure status, and the QTc interval. The prescribing cardiologist should assist with any dose adjustment.\n\n【105】### Drug Interactions With Dofetilide\n\n【106】Two antihypertensives that should not be used in these patients are hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil. Hydrochlorothiazide interferes with renal tubular cation exchange, which can increase dofetilide concentrations and result in hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.\n\n【107】These electrolyte derangements are particularly dangerous in patients with prolonged QTc. Prolonged QTc interval can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes (TdP). Verapamil is contraindicated because it inhibits CYP3A4 and can result in reduced dofetilide excretion.\n\n【108】Because of reverse-use dependence, beta blockers and CCBs should be used carefully, reduced in dose, or completely avoided if dofetilide is prescribed. This prevents the development of bradycardia, which will prolong the QTc interval and potentiate the risk of TdP in these patients. Caution should be exercised with all drugs that prolong the QTc interval or are inhibitors of CYP3A4. These include drugs that are listed in Table 1 and Table 3 . It is critical to avoid hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia as well, and oral supplementation may be needed to minimize QTc interval prolongation.\n\n【109】Table 3 AADs and Other Common Agents That Cause QT Prolongation\n\n|  | QT prolongation |\n| --- | --- |\n| Outpatient AADs | AmiodaroneDofetilideSotalol |\n| Drugs with potential interactions | Antiemetics (ondansetron, metoclopramide)Antipsychotics (haloperidol, droperidol)Antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, macrolides, trimethoprim, azoles)LoperamideMethadone |\n\n【111】AADs, antiarrhythmic drugs.\n\n【112】#### Resolution\n\n【113】You decide to avoid verapamil and hydrochlorothiazide. You avoid beta blockers, given the concern for bradycardia, and use a first-line agent such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. You monitor magnesium and potassium levels and plan to prescribe oral supplementation if these are lower than 2 mmol/L or 4 mmol/L, respectively.\n\n【114】Sotalol (Potassium Channel Blocker): a Potassium Channel Blocker With Beta-Blocker Effect\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【115】A 55-year-old woman with AF comes in for consideration of initiating an AAD. She has normal renal function and a normal ejection fraction noted on echocardiography. Her resting heart rate is 52 beats/min. Her husband is receiving sotalol for AF, and she wants to know whether this would be a suitable medication for her.\n\n【116】### Sotalol vs Dofetilide\n\n【117】Sotalol has many similarities to dofetilide. Sotalol is a potassium channel blocker commonly used for AF. It prolongs the QTc interval and requires inpatient initiation. It is also cleared through the kidneys. Unlike dofetilide, sotalol has an additional beta-blocker effect. Therefore, you should be particularly vigilant about bradycardia, which may potentiate deadly ventricular arrhythmias such as TdP. This drug, like dofetilide, exhibits reverse-use dependence and thus works more effectively at slower heart rates.\n\n【118】Sotalol should not be used in patients who are bradycardic while awake (heart rate <60 beats/min), given the higher risk for TdP. Key points for use of potassium channel blockers are summarized in Table 4 .\n\n【119】Table 4 Key Summary Points for Potassium Channel Blockers (Vaughan-Williams Class III)\n\n| Sotalol and dofetilide |\n| --- |\n| • The drug is most efficacious at slower heart rates; need to avoid significant bradycardia. |\n| • Beta blockers and CCBs should be used carefully or discontinued. |\n| • Inpatient loading is required for 5 doses (both are twice-daily medications). |\n| • Careful use is necessary with drugs that can provoke hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (eg, diuretics). |\n| • The drug is contraindicated if baseline QTc is >450 milliseconds. Avoid other QT-prolonging medications; concern for TdP. |\n| • Avoid the drug in patients with renal dysfunction as it is renally cleared. |\n| • Monitor with creatinine, potassium, and magnesium levels and ECG every 6-12 months. |\n\n【121】AF, atrial fibrillation; CCB, calcium channel blocker; ECG, electrocardiography; TdP, torsades de pointes.\n\n【122】#### Resolution\n\n【123】Given her sinus bradycardia, you decide she is not a good candidate for sotalol. She may be a candidate for dofetilide, which does not have the added beta-blocker effect but is still of concern, given her already low resting heart rate. She may be a candidate for catheter ablation or require a pacemaker for safe institution of other AADs for AF treatment. You refer her to an electrophysiologist for an in-depth discussion of treatment options.\n\n【124】AADS and QT Prolongation\n------------------------\n\n【125】A 65-year-old man with prior colon adenocarcinoma presents with nausea and diarrhea. He has a history of AF while receiving sotalol for many years. He also takes loperamide as needed. ECG today shows sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block (LBBB), heart rate of 62 beats/min, and a QTc interval of 525 milliseconds. He wants to know what medications to avoid as he read that some can be bad for his heart.\n\n【126】### Measurement of QTc\n\n【127】The QT interval should be measured from the start of the QRS to the end of the T wave (measured in milliseconds; 1 small box on standard ECG is 40 milliseconds, and 1 large box (5 small boxes) is 200 milliseconds). The end of the T wave may be unclear or obscured by a U wave. A common recommendation is to draw a tangent line along the steepest part of the terminal portion of the T wave until it intersects with the isoelectric line as shown in Figure 5 . Note, this means that the terminal portion of the QT interval measurement may not be on the electrocardiographic signal itself. This is then corrected for heart rate by the Bazett formula, which involves dividing the QT interval by the square root of the R-R interval (measured between 2 consecutive R waves, in seconds).\n\n【128】Figure 5 QT and JT measurement with correction for wide QRS. The QT and JT measurements are shown for normal QRS (left) and wide QRS (center and right). Note, on the left panel, the measurement of the terminal portion of the QT/JT is the intersection of the tangent line and the isoelectric line and does not intersect with the electrocardiographic signal itself. The Bazett formula for QTc and simple QT correction for wide QRS are shown. LBBB, left bundle branch block; RBBB, right bundle branch block.\n\n【129】For a preexisting wide QRS, there are many proposed formulas to correct for a wide QRS of any form (such as LBBB). The most often used at our institution is QT – (QRS – 120), essentially removing the contribution of the widened QRS to the QT (compared with if it were normal, <120 milliseconds). A simpler method is measurement of the JT interval (end of the QRS to the end of the T wave) without rate correction. A JT interval of less than 400 milliseconds is considered acceptable .\n\n【130】### QT-Prolonging Medications\n\n【131】Many common medications can prolong the QT interval: antiemetics (ondansetron, metoclopramide), antipsychotics (haloperidol, droperidol), antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, macrolides, trimethoprim, azoles), and antidiarrheals (loperamide). A list of common QT-prolonging AADs and other medications is provided in Table 3 . If QTc is greater than 500 milliseconds or JT is greater than 400 milliseconds, the patient is a greater risk for development of TdP.\n\n【132】### Other Clinical Situations to Avoid\n\n【133】In addition to avoidance of other QT-prolonging medications, clinicians should be mindful of risk or propensity for electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) as well as severe bradycardia. If any of these situations seems likely, consideration of discontinuation of sotalol (as well as of dofetilide) may be required as this can exacerbate QTc prolongation and lead to TdP.\n\n【134】#### Resolution\n\n【135】After correction of LBBB, his QTc is 480 milliseconds (<500 milliseconds), which has been stable. You avoid any QTc-prolonging medications and maintain adequate electrolyte balance. You recommend an antidiarrheal other than loperamide, given its QTc-prolonging effects.\n\n【136】AADS and Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【137】A 75-year-old man with persistent AF status despite two catheter ablations who is currently taking sotalol presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion. Echocardiography shows a reduced ejection fraction of 35% while in AF with an average rate of 110 beats/min (previously, ejection fraction was 60% and average heart rate was 65 beats/min). He notes that in the past, additional diuretics helped with his lung congestion and leg swelling.\n\n【138】### Drug Interaction Considerations in Heart Failure\n\n【139】In addition to renal and hepatic clearance issues from organ dysfunction in heart failure, there are important drug interaction considerations in using AADs for these patients. Diuretics, such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide, may provoke hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. These electrolyte derangements may potentiate dangerous arrhythmias with use of AADs such as dofetilide and sotalol. These medications should be monitored carefully or discontinued. CCBs should generally be avoided in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.\n\n【140】### Restoration of Sinus Rhythm in Heart Failure\n\n【141】AF in patients with heart failure portends a poorer outcome, and randomized controlled trials (Catheter Ablation versus Standard Conventional Therapy in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Atrial Fibrillation \\[CASTLE-AF\\]; heart failure subgroup of the Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation \\[CABANA\\] trial) have shown improved cardiovascular outcomes with sinus rhythm.\n\n【142】Effect of catheter ablation vs antiarrhythmic drug therapy on mortality, stroke, bleeding, and cardiac arrest among patients with atrial fibrillation: the CABANA randomized clinical trial.\n\n【143】Catheter ablation for treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【144】Evidence from the 2020 Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention (EAST-AFNET 4) trial showed that early rhythm control with AAD or ablation had improved cardiovascular outcomes, including cardiovascular death, stroke, and heart failure hospitalizations, compared with usual care (rate control in most cases).\n\n【145】Early rhythm-control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【146】In the setting of heart failure, there are few pharmacologic options for rhythm control. Sinus rhythm can be restored with an AAD, such as amiodarone or dofetilide. Nondrug options include AF catheter ablation and AV nodal ablation with pacemaker implantation. As such, it is important to refer these patients to an electrophysiologist to consider early rhythm control, given the data on mortality benefit. The potential reasons to consider catheter ablation in AF are listed in Table 5 .\n\n【147】Table 5 When to Consider Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation\n\n| • Heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction |\n| --- |\n| • Previous intolerance to or inefficacy of one or more classes of AADs |\n| • Drug interactions with other necessary medications |\n| • Current or likely risk for development of severe hepatic or renal dysfunction |\n| • Baseline heart rate or ECG abnormalities that preclude certain AADs |\n| • Patient’s preference to avoid daily medications |\n\n【149】AADs, antiarrhythmic drugs; ECG, electrocardiography.\n\n【150】#### Resolution\n\n【151】You initiate a diuretic with careful monitoring of potassium and magnesium concentrations. You set up consultation with an electrophysiologist to discuss treatment options for this AF.\n\n【152】AADS in Chronic Kidney and Liver Disease\n----------------------------------------\n\n【153】A 76-year-old man with chronic alcoholism with resultant cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease with a creatinine concentration of 2.2 mg/dL has recurrent episodes of symptomatic AF requiring hospitalization and cardioversion. He wants to know whether there are any AADs that would be suitable for him, given his chronic kidney and liver disease.\n\n【154】### Renally Cleared AADs and Anticoagulants\n\n【155】Many AADs are renally cleared, requiring dose adjustments or avoidance in the setting of chronic renal failure. These include flecainide, propafenone, atenolol, sotalol, dofetilide, and digoxin. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, amiodarone is often used in this setting. Most beta blockers (except atenolol) and CCBs can be used. Warfarin may be used for anticoagulation. Of the direct oral anticoagulants, dabigatran and rivaroxaban should be avoided in severe renal dysfunction.\n\n【156】Apixaban may be considered with reduced dosing.\n\n【157】Outcomes associated with apixaban use in patients with end-stage kidney disease and atrial fibrillation in the United States.\n\n【158】Apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and advanced chronic kidney disease.\n\n【159】AADs with major renal clearance are listed in Table 6 .\n\n【160】Table 6 Major Metabolic Routes of Antiarrhythmic and Anticoagulation Agents\n\n|  | Major renal clearance | Major hepatic clearance |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Class I | Disopyramide | FlecainidePropafenoneDisopyramide |\n| Class II | AtenololBisoprololNadolol | MetoprololCarvedilol |\n| Class III | SotalolDofetilide | Amiodarone |\n| Class IV |  | VerapamilDiltiazem |\n| Other | Digoxin |  |\n| Anticoagulants | Apixaban (can reduce dose)DabigatranRivaroxaban | Warfarin (dose by INR)ApixabanRivaroxaban |\n\n【162】INR, international normalized ratio.\n\n【163】### Hepatically Cleared AADs and Anticoagulants\n\n【164】Hepatically cleared AADs should be used carefully in patients with cirrhosis. Hepatically cleared AADs include flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, and most beta blockers and CCBs. Whereas flecainide and propafenone should generally be avoided completely, the other hepatically cleared AADs can be used at reduced doses with close monitoring.\n\n【165】Warfarin is extensively metabolized by the liver but may be used with careful monitoring of the international normalized ratio. Rivaroxaban and apixaban should be avoided in severe hepatic dysfunction.\n\n【166】AADs with major hepatic clearance are listed in Table 6 .\n\n【167】#### Resolution\n\n【168】Given both severe chronic kidney and liver failure and limited drug options, you refer him to a cardiologist to discuss AF treatment strategies that may include rate control vs pacemaker and AV node ablation. You decide to anticoagulate with warfarin, with close monitoring of the international normalized ratio.\n\n【169】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【170】We hope these clinical vignettes provide the reader with an appreciation for some of the most common AAD-related situations in which primary care clinicians are the first point of contact. Referral to discuss the option of catheter ablation is appropriate when the patient prefers to avoid treatment with AADs. This can be due to problems with previous AAD treatment, such as intolerance, inefficacy, drug interactions, and comorbidities such as heart failure. Even though AAD therapy may be directed by cardiologists and electrophysiologists, we hope these key lessons offer primary care clinicians the ability to manage patients more confidently and safely when they are required to receive AAD therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Current diagnostic methods are limited in their ability to diagnose early disease and accurately predict individual risk of disease progression and outcome. The lack of adequate approaches to properly define disease subgroups precludes rational treatment design and selection. Better tools are urgently needed to provide more accurate and personalized melanoma patient management. Recent progress in the understanding of the molecular aberrations that underlie melanoma oncogenesis will likely advance the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of melanoma. The emerging pattern of molecular complexity in melanoma tumors mirrors the clinical diversity of the disease and highlights the notion that melanoma, like other cancers, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous group of disorders that arise from complex molecular changes. Understanding of molecular aberrations involving important cellular processes, such as cellular signaling networks, cell cycle regulation, and cell death, will be essential for better diagnosis, accurate assessment of prognosis, and rational design of effective therapeutics. Defining an individual patient's unique tumor characteristics may lead to personalized prediction of outcomes and selection of therapy.

Cases were classified based on positive microbiology data from extracted devices or blood cultures.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of the 623 CIED infections during the study period, 31 (5.0%) were caused by GNB and 323 (51.8%) by GPB. Patients in the GNB group were more likely to present with local inflammatory findings at the pocket site (90.3% vs 72.4%; _P_ \\=.03). All patients with bacteremia due to GNB had concomitant pocket infection compared with those with GPB (100% vs 33.9%; _P_ \\=.002). After extraction, 41.9% of patients in the GNB group were managed with oral antibiotics vs 2.4% in the GPB group ( _P_ <.001). There were no statistically significant differences in infection relapse/recurrence or 1-year survival rates between the 2 groups.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Compared with CIED infections caused by GPB, those due to GNB are more likely to present with pocket infection. Device-related GNB bacteremia almost always originates from the generator pocket.

Hypertension in pregnancy includes a spectrum of conditions, most notably preeclampsia, a form of hypertension unique to pregnancy that occurs de novo or superimposed on chronic hypertension. Risks to the fetus include premature delivery, growth retardation, and death. The only definitive treatment of preeclampsia is delivery. Treatment of severe hypertension is necessary to prevent cerebrovascular, cardiac, and renal complications in the mother. The 2 other forms of hypertension, chronic and transient hypertension, usually have more benign courses. Optimal treatment of high blood pressure in pregnancy requires consideration of several aspects unique to gestational cardiovascular physiology. The major goal is to prevent maternal complications without compromising uteroplacental perfusion and fetal circulation. Before an antihypertensive agent is prescribed, the potential risk to the fetus from intrauterine drug exposure should be carefully reviewed.\n\n【1】ACE ( angiotensin-converting enzyme ), DBP ( diastolic blood pressure ), HELLP ( hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count ), NHBPEP ( National High Blood Pressure Education Program ), SBP ( systolic blood pressure )\n\n【2】Normal pregnancy is characterized by increases in cardiac output and blood volume, generalized vasodilatation, a decrease in blood pressure, and resistance to pressor agents such as norepinephrine and angiotensin II.\n\n【3】Blood pressure achieves a nadir by midpregnancy, then returns to prepregnancy levels at term. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is less affected than diastolic blood pressure (DBP) because of the increased cardiac output that offsets the vasodilatation. Further decline is noted during sleep, which follows the pattern of normal circadian rhythms observed in nonpregnant women.\n\n【4】DEFINITION AND CLASSIFICATION\n-----------------------------\n\n【5】Hypertension in pregnancy is defined as a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher. Korotkoff phase V (disappearance) rather than Korotkoff phase IV (muffling of sounds) is used for the determination of DBP.\n\n【6】In the outpatient setting, blood pressure should be measured in the sitting position, after a period of rest in a quiet environment. For hospitalized patients, the lateral recumbent position eliminates the effect of compression of the inferior vena cava by the enlarged uterus that impairs venous return and causes a decline in blood pressure. Regardless of posture, special care should be taken to ensure that the patient's arms are kept at the heart level; positioning the arms above the heart can spuriously reduce the blood pressure readings. In pregnancy, the lowest blood pressures are obtained by using the right arm while the patient is resting in the left lateral position.\n\n【7】These blood pressure readings might merely reflect the changes in hydrostatic pressure caused by keeping the right arm above the heart. Therefore, the increases in blood pressure with a change from a lateral to a supine position may simply represent a postural phenomenon rather than positive results on a rollover test, once considered a predictor of preeclampsia.\n\n【8】The Working Group of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program (NHBPEP) recently published a second report revising the classification of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.\n\n【9】The term _transient hypertension_ was replaced by _gestational hypertension,_ which is used only during pregnancy for a group of women who develop high blood pressure for the first time after 20 weeks' gestation in the absence of proteinuria. The rest of the classification remains unchanged .\n\n【10】Table 1 Classification of Hypertensive Disorders in Pregnancy\n\n| Preeclampsia-eclampsia |\n| --- |\n| Preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension |\n| Chronic hypertension |\n| Gesiational hypertension |\n\n【12】### Preeclampsia\n\n【13】Preeclampsia is a multisystemic disease characterized by hypertension and proteinuria, a protein level of 300 mg or greater in a 24-hour urine specimen that roughly correlates with a qualitative measurement of 1+ (30 mg/dL) on dipstick urinalysis in the absence of urinary tract infection. Because of disagreement between random and 24-hour urinary protein determinations, the latter is recommended for diagnostic purposes. If this is not feasible, a timed urinary collection corrected for creatinine excretion is an acceptable alternative. The diagnosis of hypertension is supported by recording elevated blood pressure on 2 determinations performed 6 hours apart.\n\n【14】An important feature of preeclampsia is its unpredictable clinical course; women with mild hypertension and minimal proteinuria can have rapid progression to the convulsive form of eclampsia. Thus, distinguishing between “mild” and “severe” forms is discouraged because it can be clinically misleading.\n\n【15】However, certain symptoms and signs are considered markers of severe disease and necessitate close monitoring and, frequently, urgent delivery. These include an SBP of 160 mm Hg or higher and a DBP of 110 mm Hg or higher, nephrotic range proteinuria (protein level ≥3.5 g/24 h), renal functional impairment (serum creatinine level >1.2 mg/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 × l0 /L), and/or evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, hepatocellular injury, pulmonary edema, and neurologic disturbances.\n\n【16】Preeclampsia usually occurs after 20 weeks of gestation and traditionally is considered a disease of the first pregnancy. However, women with a history of preeclampsia have an increased risk during subsequent pregnancies. Other risk factors include extremes of reproductive age, multiple gestations (eg, twins), family history of preeclampsia, and the presence of trophoblastic disease, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, connective tissue disease, and renal disease. The hemodynamic changes include decreased cardiac output relative to normal pregnancy, elevated peripheral vascular resistance, and loss or reversal of the normal diurnal rhythm, resulting in elevated nocturnal blood pressure readings.\n\n【17】The _h_ emolysis, _e_ levated _l_ iver enzymes, _l_ ow _p_ latelet count (HELLP) syndrome is a deceptive form of preeclampsia. It can rapidly evolve into a life-threatening syndrome of liver failure and worsening thrombocytopenia in the presence of only mild to moderate hypertension. The most severe complication of the HELLP syndrome is liver rupture, which has high maternal and fetal mortality rates.\n\n【18】The cause and pathogenesis of preeclampsia remain elusive. Consequently, specific preventive and treatment options have not been developed. Ideally, high-risk patients should be evaluated early in pregnancy by an obstetrician with special expertise in this field. The baseline values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, serum uric acid, creatinine, and protein excretion should be obtained because a comparison with values later in pregnancy may help in establishing the diagnosis of preeclampsia.\n\n【19】Patients presenting with hypertension in the second half of pregnancy should be additionally monitored for hepatic involvement (serum transaminase levels), presence of hemolysis (lactic acid dehydrogenase level and blood smear), and degree of capillary leak (serum albumin level). These tests are particularly useful in monitoring disease severity and progression.\n\n【20】If preeclampsia develops at less than 32 weeks' gestation, when the fetus is still immature, consideration should be given to postponing delivery.\n\n【21】This is a reasonable approach when hypertension is mild, and no renal, liver, or coagulation abnormalities are evident. Patients should be hospitalized and closely monitored for signs of fetal distress and symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, and right upper quadrant pain that may herald progression to more severe forms, including eclampsia. The threshold for initiation of antihypertensive therapy is the same as for severe preeclampsia, ie, DBP of 100 mm Hg or higher. An oral agent is preferred if delivery is not expected within 48 hours.\n\n【22】Outpatient management can be considered for asymptomatic patients with treatment-responsive hypertension in the absence of marked proteinuria (protein level <1 g/24 h).\n\n【23】Labor should be induced when pregnancies are at or near term and in women with severe hypertension persisting after 24 to 48 hours of treatment, HELLP syndrome, progressive renal failure, premonitory signs of eclampsia, and fetal distress.\n\n【24】Patients having severe preeclampsia at less than 34 weeks' gestation should receive corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung development. Intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy has been shown to be more effective than either phenytoin or diazepam for seizure prophylaxis in women with severe preeclampsia and for prevention of recurrent seizures in those with eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate should be administered during labor and delivery and for at least 24 hours postpartum by con­tinuous intravenous infusion. To avoid magnesium toxicity in women with renal insufficiency, the maintenance dose should be reduced, and the serum magnesium levels should be monitored every 1 to 2 hours (compared to every 4-6 hours in women with normal renal function) until a steady state is reached. Effective therapy for magnesium toxicity is intravenous calcium gluconate, which should be available at the bedside.\n\n【25】Studies have shown that pharmacological treatment of DBP of 110 mm Hg or greater decreases the incidence of acute maternal cardiac and cerebral insults.\n\n【26】Most investigators agree that antihypertensive therapy in the peripartum period should be initiated when the DBP approaches 100 mm Hg.\n\n【27】The most important reason for treatment of hypertension is the prevention of maternal cerebrovasular and cardiac complications. Control of blood pressure does not prevent or cure preeclampsia. In fact, eclamptic seizures can occur when the blood pressure is only mildly elevated.\n\n【28】### Chronic Hypertension\n\n【29】The hallmark of chronic hypertension is a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or greater before pregnancy or before the 20th week of gestation. Most patients will have a benign course with an exaggerated decrease in DBP of as much as 20 mm Hg. This often leads to normalization of blood pressure in midpregnancy and may mask the diagnosis of chronic hypertension if prepregnancy values are unknown. The blood pressure usually increases to pregnancy levels in the third trimester, frequently leading to diagnostic confusion with preeclampsia. Proteinuria is absent in uncomplicated chronic hypertension, and when it occurs for the first time in the third trimester, it is the best indicator of superimposed preeclampsia. Antihypertensive treatment is usually instituted for an SBP of 150 mm Hg or greater or a DBP of 100 mm Hg or greater, unless there is evidence of renal disease or other target organ complica­tions.\n\n【30】In these instances, antihypertensive therapy is initiated when the DBP is 90 mm Hg or greater. Women with chronic hypertension are at an increased risk for developing preeclampsia, particularly if the blood pressure does not decline in midgestation or if they have secondary hypertension. Ideally, they should be evaluated before pregnancy for end-organ damage, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertensive nephropathy, and retinopathy. A work-up of secondary hypertension should be considered (eg, primary hyperaldosteronism, renovascular disease, pheochromocytoma), particularly in young patients with hard-to-control blood pressure requiring several antihypertensive agents. Medications prescribed before pregnancy can be continued during pregnancy except for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin **II** receptor blockers. Women taking these medications who present for prepregnancy counseling should be told to use another agent (eg, methyldopa) before conception.\n\n【31】The combination of hypertension and kidney disease is associated with increased risks of fetal loss, prematurity, and intrauterine growth retardation. Women with chronic renal diseases should be advised to plan their pregnancies while their renal function is relatively preserved (serum creatinine level ≤1.4 mg/dL) because fetal prognosis has improved with the neonatal care currently available. Such patients require the collaborative efforts of a multidisciplinary team, including high-risk obstetrics, nephrology, and hypertension, for optimal treatment.\n\n【32】Women with preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension are at particularly high risk for cerebral hemorrhage and placental abruption. It remains unclear whether early treatment of chronic hypertension in pregnancy prevents preeclampsia. Several randomized trials have failed to demonstrate that treatment of chronic hypertension reduces the incidence of superimposed preeclampsia.\n\n【33】The main criticism of these trials was inadequate sample size; moreover, only 1 trial was placebo-controlled. The continued uncertainty can be resolved only by carefully designed clinical trials, which are urgently needed.\n\n【34】### Gestational Hypertension\n\n【35】Gestational hypertension is characterized by hypertension occurring for the first time in the second half of pregnancy in the absence of proteinuria. This category encompasses both women with preeclampsia who have not yet developed proteinuria and those with hypertension only. The differentiation between these 2 groups is possible only retrospectively, ie, postpartum. _Transient hypertension_ (the term previously used for this category) refers to a subgroup of women in whom blood pressure returns to normal by 12 weeks' postpartum. The failure of blood pressure to normalize leads to the diagnosis of chronic hypertension. Transient hypertension has a benign course and good prognosis, with a tendency to recur in subsequent pregnancies. The blood pressure usually normalizes shortly after delivery, although the risk of developing hypertension later in life is increased.\n\n【36】TREATMENT\n---------\n\n【37】Goals for the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy differ from those for the general hypertensive population. The benefit of treatment of mild diastolic hypertension, blood pressure of 90 to 99 mm Hg, has been clearly established and documented for the general population, while in pregnancy it remains an area of controversy in the absence of well-designed clinical trials.\n\n【38】The choice of antihypertensive medication in pregnancy is limited by concerns for fetal safety. In addition to proven safety, an ideal antihypertensive agent should gradually reduce blood pressure without compromising uteroplacental blood flow to the fetus. If administered intravenously, a short-acting formulation that permits rapid reversal of hypotension is preferred. According to the Working Group report of the NHBPEP, first-line oral and intravenous treatment is methyldopa and hydralazine, respectively. Methyldopa is the only antihypertensive agent with a proven record of safety in pregnancy, established by follow-up studies of children exposed to the drug in utero.\n\n【39】Because of its long history of efficacy and acceptable side-effect profile, intravenous hydralazine is recommended for the treatment of severe hypertension in women who are near term. Other antihypertensive medications are now being used more often, particularly if blood pressure control cannot be achieved with first-line agents or in the presence of intolerable adverse effects. Some of the newer agents have demonstrated efficacy and safety comparable to those of methyldopa and hydralazine.\n\n【40】β-Blockers have demonstrated effective blood pressure control and a satisfactory safety profile when administered in the third trimester. Labetalol has been used with increasing frequency for the treatment of severe acute hypertension during pregnancy and has shown efficacy and tolerance equivalent to hydralazine.\n\n【41】The main concerns about the use of β-blockers stem from evidence of intrauterine growth retardation and low placental weight documented when atenolol was used in the second trimester.\n\n【42】β-Blockers can potentially cause additional adverse effects, such as fetal bradycardia, impaired fetal compensatory response to hypoxia, and neonatal hypoglycemia.\n\n【43】Data on the safety and efficacy of calcium channel blockers, especially early in pregnancy, are limited. Calcium channel blockers are potent tocolytics and can affect the progression of labor. Another concern is the potential for profound hypotension and circulatory collapse when magnesium sulfate is used concurrently with calcium channel blockers for seizure prophylaxis. In pregnancy, calcium channel blockers are increasingly used for severe hypertension refractory to other drugs. Nifedipine has been studied most extensively and has been shown to decrease blood pressure and improve renal function without affecting blood flow in the umbilical artery.\n\n【44】As in other settings, the availability of long-acting preparations has mitigated the risk of precipitous blood pressure decreases that can potentially compromise uteroplacental blood flow and fetal well-being.\n\n【45】According to the Working Group report of the NHBPEP, diuretics can be continued during pregnancy if initiated before conception, especially in women with salt-sensitive chronic hypertension.\n\n【46】Other indications for diuretic therapy are hypertension in the setting of renal failure and congestive heart failure. Possible adverse effects include electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hyperuricemia. Diuretics can aggravate volume depletion and promote reactive vasoconstriction and should be avoided in women with preeclampsia.\n\n【47】ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy. They adversely affect the fetal renal system, causing anuria and oligohydramnios. Complications reported in newborns after in utero exposure during the second and third trimester include fetal limb abnormalities, lung hypoplasia, craniofacial deformities, and renal dysplasia.\n\n【48】Angiotensin II receptor blockers exert a similar hemodynamic effect on fetal renal circulation and can potentially cause similar fetal malformations. Fetuses of women who take ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers during the first trimester are not considered at a higher risk for these malformations, and women exposed to such agents during this time do not need to terminate their pregnancy.\n\n【49】Finally, direct vasodilators, other than hydralazine, may need to be considered for the rare patient with severe refractory hypertension. Direct vasodilators can cause severe complications, such as excessive hypotension (both sodium nitroprusside and diazoxide) and cyanide intoxication (sodium nitroprusside only), making them the agents of last resort.\n\n【50】Nonpharmacological treatment consists mainly of bed rest, which has been shown not only to lower blood pressure but also to promote diuresis and reduce premature labor.\n\n【51】However, pregnant women with sodium-sensitive chronic hypertension should continue salt restriction during pregnancy. Salt restriction is not recommended for routine treatment of women with preeclampsia, who frequently are volume contracted.\n\n【52】Prevention of preeclampsia has been attempted by using several strategies. Some have proved to be unsuccessful, such as salt restriction, magnesium,\n\n【53】and fish oil supplementation\n\n【54】 others are potentially dangerous (diuretics). The role of low-dose aspirin has been studied in several large trials, including the multicenter Collaborative Low-dose Aspirin Study in Pregnancy (CLASP) trial that failed to show a beneficial effect of aspirin in the prevention of preeclampsia. Although the study was designed to include women with a higher risk, the incidence of preeclampsia in the placebo group was only 7.6%, similar to that in the general population. Therefore, the issue of the role of aspirin in high-risk groups remained unclear. In 1998, the National Institutes of Health published the results of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the role of low-dose aspirin in the prevention of preeclampsia in 2539 women at higher risk (history of chronic hypertension, insulin-treated diabetes mellitus, multifetal gestations, and preeclampsia in previous pregnancy).\n\n【55】Low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia in women at high risk.\n\n【56】The demonstrated benefit was too small to justify routine prophylaxis: 38 women would need to be treated to prevent 1 case of preeclampsia. Similarly, low-dose aspirin did not improve perinatal outcomes in these women. Calcium supplementation, beyond the daily recommended level, also proved of no benefit in a large National Institutes of Health trial of 4589 healthy nulliparous women.\n\n【57】National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Network of Matemal-Felal Medicine Units.

While the investigators recognized the need for multicenter trials to assess the effects in low-risk and high-risk patients from different populations, these studies should also address the issues of safety, particularly for the fetus, of vitamins C and E at the recommended doses.\n\n【61】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【62】The ultimate goal of treatment of hypertension in pregnancy is delivery of a healthy newborn without compromising maternal health. Early diagnosis and subsequent close monitoring of both mother and fetus are crucial. Elevated blood pressure without proteinuria usually has a benign course and can be managed on an outpatient basis. Antihypertensive medications should be used judiciously, and fetal risks from intrauterine exposure must be carefully evaluated. Severe preeclampsia (both pure and superimposed) represents an obstetrical emergency, with potential fatal outcomes for both fetus and mother. Optimally, such women should be hospitalized and treated with bed rest, antihypertensive medications, and magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis. The definitive treatment of preeclampsia is delivery. For mild forms remote from term, postponing delivery is desirable and, if possible, can improve neonatal prognosis by decreasing prematurity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

She was fatigued and confused and had poor oral intake. In the past 2 months, she had lost 10 kg. Two weeks before admission, she started to exhibit atypical behaviors, such as walking about her house undressed. The patient denied fever, headaches, seizures, nuchal rigidity, visual changes, weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and bowel or bladder incontinence. She was evaluated at another institution for her symptoms about 2 weeks before. Work-up at that time included electroencephalography, which showed generalized slowing consistent with metabolic encephalopathy. The patient received a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin for delirium that was presumed to be secondary to a urinary tract infection. Her symptoms did not improve with antibiotic therapy, so she presented to our institution for further evaluation.\n\n【1】The patient had a long-standing history of bipolar disorder and anxiety treated by a psychiatrist. Her medications included divalproex, lithium, quetiapine, fluphenazine, and clonazepam. Her psychiatric medications had not changed recently, and her mood disorder had been stable for many years. Her other medication was tolterodine, which she had been using for urinary incontinence. The patient and her husband owned a small business, and she had been in charge of the accounting up until 2 months before hospital admission. She smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for many years and denied alcohol consumption or drug abuse.\n\n【2】Physical examination revealed an elderly woman in no acute distress. She was somnolent but arousable and followed instructions. Her affect was flat, and language was remarkable for simple 1-word answers. Her vital signs and general physical examination findings were normal. Neurologic examination revealed an altered mental status with deficits in attention, learning, and recall. She scored 24 out of 38 points on the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, with deficits in attention, learning, and recall. Cranial nerves and motor and sensory functions were normal. Reflexes were symmetric, and plantar response was flexor. The patient's gait was normal, and she had no ataxia.\n\n【3】Chest radiography and electrocardiography performed on admission were unremarkable. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed several small hypodense areas in periventricular white matter consistent with small vessel disease. Laboratory studies (reference ranges provided parenthetically) were remarkable for a hemoglobin of 9 g/dL (12.0-15.5 g/dL) and a mean corpuscular volume of 81 fL (81.6-98.3 fL). Levels of electrolytes, blood glucose, and serum creatinine, transaminases, ammonia, lithium, and valproic acid were within normal or therapeutic range, as were findings on arterial blood gas analysis, urinalysis, and urine drug screening.\n\n【4】*   1.\n\n【5】    **_Which one of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's delirium?_**\n\n【6】    *   a.\n\n【7】        _Bacterial meningitis_\n\n【8】    *   b.\n\n【9】        _Viral encephalitis_\n\n【10】    *   c.\n\n【11】        _Metabolic encephalopathy_\n\n【12】    *   d.\n\n【13】        _Medication-induced delirium_\n\n【14】    *   e.\n\n【15】        _Subdural hematoma_\n\n【16】In reviews of the presentation of bacterial meningitis, approximately 99% to 100% of affected patients present with at least 1 of the following: fever, neck stiffness, or change in mental status.\n\n【17】Acute bacterial meningitis in adults: a review of 493 episodes.\n\n【18】Our patient's 1-month history of delirium without fever or meningeal signs argues against the typical presentation of bacterial meningitis. Numerous viral agents can cause an encephalitis or meningoencephalitis with varying clinical presentation, including herpes simplex virus, enteroviruses, echoviruses, coxsackieviruses, mumps, human immunodeficiency virus, and arboviruses. Affected patients may exhibit a maculopapular exanthem, grouped dermal vesicles, flaccid paralysis, fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, or mental status changes. Our patient's prolonged duration of delirium in the absence of fever and headaches and without focal neurologic findings on examination was not consistent with viral encephalitis. A variety of conditions can cause a metabolic encephalopathy, including hepatic or renal impairment and endocrinopathies. Physical examination findings and laboratory evaluation in our patient were not consistent with a hepatic or uremic encephalopathy. Delirium is caused by medications in up to 30% of all cases.\n\n【19】Our patient was taking multiple psychiatric medications. The combination of lithium with dopamine antagonists such as fluphenazine has been reported to cause weakness, dyskinesias, and encephalopathy.\n\n【20】The patient's benzodiazepine and anticholinergic agent could also have contributed to her altered mental status. Thus, a careful review of medications is essential in evaluating delirium for all patients. Subdural hematoma was unlikely in this patient given the findings on CT of the head.\n\n【21】Careful review of the patient's records showed no recent changes in her psychiatric medications and a mood disorder that had been stable for many years. Additional history indicated exposure to mosquitoes and tick bites several months earlier. The patient had always lived in the Midwest in a farmhouse adjacent to a large forest. Drinking water was obtained from a home well. She had no remarkable travel history. The patient owned a cat but denied recent cat scratches.\n\n【22】A lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed an opening pressure of 14 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O, 1 nucleated cell/mL, a glucose level of 51 mg/dL (serum glucose, 91 mg/dL), and a protein level of 54 mg/dL (14-45 mg/dL). Cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain, bacterial cultures, and polymerase chain reaction were negative for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella zoster virus. Urine and blood cultures showed no growth. Morning cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, serum folate, and vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> levels were within normal limits. Over the next several days, the patient's quetiapine, clonazepam, fluphenazine, and tolterodine were tapered and discontinued. Her mental status, however, showed little improvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed mild to moderate cortical atrophy along with periventricular and subcortical white matter changes consistent with small vessel disease. No evidence of recent infarction was seen.\n\n【23】*   2.\n\n【24】    **_Which one of the following diagnostic tests would be least appropriate in this patient?_**\n\n【25】    *   a.\n\n【26】        _Cerebrospinal fluid arbovirus antibody analysis_\n\n【27】    *   b.\n\n【28】        Borrelia burgdorferi _serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with CSF antibody analysis_\n\n【29】    *   c.\n\n【30】        Bartonella henselae _antibody analysis_\n\n【31】    *   d.\n\n【32】        _Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test_\n\n【33】    *   e.\n\n【34】        _Urine arsenic assay_\n\n【35】Findings on CSF analysis are not suggestive of viral meningitis. However, cases have been documented to occur with normal CSF findings.\n\n【36】Arboviral infections of the central nervous system can present as meningitis, meningoencephalitis, or encephalitis and should remain in the differential diagnosis for this patient given her history of exposure. Lyme meningitis is usually associated with a CSF pleocytosis and often occurs in late summer to fall. The onset of neuroborreliosis, however, is variable and occasionally includes the triad of meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculitis. Lyme and Bartonella encephalitis should be considered given the history of exposure to tick bite and cat. Neurosyphilis, which can manifest as personality changes in addition to hyperreflexia, paresthesias, and tabes dorsalis, should be evaluated in this patient. Heavy metal toxicity can occur from contaminated well water. However, the neurologic symptoms of long-term arsenic poisoning are primarily limited to polyneuropathy with only very rare cases of encephalitis among individuals with an occupational exposure to arsenic, making this the least likely answer.\n\n【37】During her hospital stay, the patient's mental status continued to wax and wane. Later, she developed diffuse muscle weakness that was not present on admission. Physical examination confirmed the presence of proximal muscle weakness. Because of the patient's variable mental condition, it could not be determined whether the muscle weakness was secondary to pain.\n\n【38】*   3.\n\n【39】    **_Which one of the following diagnostic approaches would be the most appropriate next step in evaluating the patient's delirium?_**\n\n【40】    *   a.\n\n【41】        _Electromyography_\n\n【42】    *   b.\n\n【43】        _Vastus lateralis muscle biopsy_\n\n【44】    *   c.\n\n【45】        _Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis_\n\n【46】    *   d.\n\n【47】        _Initiation of antidelirium reorientation techniques_\n\n【48】    *   e.\n\n【49】        _Measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatinine kinase levels_\n\n【50】Electromyography may be useful for evaluating proximal muscle weakness or the presence of peripheral neuropathy. However, determining the presence of a neuropathy may not elucidate the etiology behind the patient's presenting symptom of confusion. Moreover, the patient's symptoms had been present only a few days, making it too early in the patient's course to see typical changes of most neuromuscular diseases on electromyography. Clinical suspicion of myopathy is an indication for muscle biopsy. Both polymyositis and dermatomyositis could present with proximal muscle weakness in patients of this age. However, preliminary studies such as serum creatinine kinase measurement and electromyography should be performed before initiating this relatively invasive procedure. Moreover, the patient's mental status changes are inconsistent with the presentation of most leading causes of myopathy. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis could be useful in locating occult malignancy or infection. However, the lack of evidence of a mass on MRI of the head argues against metastatic spread to the brain. Moreover, the patient had no fever, leukocytosis, or localizing history and physical examination findings to suggest hidden infection.\n\n【51】Reorientation techniques are important in the treatment of delirium, particularly in patients with prolonged hospitalizations and disrupted sleep/wake cycles. Although such techniques should certainly be considered for this patient, it is unlikely that delirium secondary to unfamiliar environment explains the patient's presentation. Her symptoms began before her hospitalization, and her proximal muscle weakness suggests an underlying etiology that merits investigation. The course of the patient's delirium in combination with progressive systemic symptoms such as muscle weakness should prompt an evaluation for vasculitis. Thus, checking serum markers of inflammation would be most appropriate. Measurement of creatinine kinase is appropriate in the evaluation of proximal muscle weakness.\n\n【52】During the hospital stay, the patient became increasingly obtunded. Although she had run a home business in the past, she could no longer perform simple arithmetic calculations nor was she aware of her name or current location. Her upper and lower extremity weakness persisted, and she required moderate assistance in sitting from a supine position. She had symptoms of jaw claudication. Serum anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and creatine kinase levels were normal. The patient had an elevated serum ESR (106 mm/1 h \\[0-29 mm/1 h\\]) and CRP level (147 mg/L \\[<8.0 mg/L\\]). Electroencephalography was performed to reevaluate the generalized slowing seen on her outside study. Diffuse slowing of 6 to 7 Hz with intermittent diffuse delta waves was seen with maximal distribution over the bitemporal head regions.\n\n【53】*   4.\n\n【54】    **_Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step?_**\n\n【55】    *   a.\n\n【56】        _Empiric corticosteroids and temporal artery biopsy_\n\n【57】    *   b.\n\n【58】        _Cerebral angiography_\n\n【59】    *   c.\n\n【60】        _Paraneoplastic CSF analysis_\n\n【61】    *   d.\n\n【62】        _Positron emission tomography/single-photon emission computed tomography of the brain_\n\n【63】    *   e.\n\n【64】        _Psychiatric evaluation for pseudodementia_\n\n【65】Although a rare manifestation, giant cell arteritis (GCA) can present with mental status changes. Jaw claudication can also be a presenting symptom with GCA. Studies indicate that patients with GCA who have an ESR greater than 100 mm/1h have constitutional symptoms more often than visual symptoms.\n\n【66】Giant cell arteritis: laboratory tests at the test of diagnosis in a series of 240 patients.\n\n【67】Investigation of GCA along with empiric corticosteroid treatment should take place before other diagnoses are pursued. Although a primary central nervous system vasculitis is a possibility, the combination of a normal CSF study and MRI of the head makes this extremely unlikely.\n\n【68】As such, cerebral angiography is unlikely to provide useful information. If paraneoplastic causes of altered mental status were in the differential diagnosis, a work-up for neoplasm should be performed before a paraneoplastic analysis of CSF. Little in the patient's history and findings on imaging studies suggested an active neoplasm. Positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography of the brain show promise for earlier detection of Alzheimer disease. However, the course of the patient's presentation and her elevated inflammatory markers should prompt evaluation of other etiologies before investigating the generally more slowly developing neurodegenerative diseases. Likewise, the elevated ESR suggests an organic cause for her symptoms that should be evaluated before pursuing a diagnosis of pseudodementia.\n\n【69】The patient denied any headaches or visual changes. Examination of the temporal region revealed no arterial tenderness, and temporal pulses were normal. A biopsy was performed on the right temporal artery, and the pathology showed vascular inflammation consistent with GCA.\n\n【70】*   5.\n\n【71】    **_Which one of the following is not part of the management plan for this patient?_**\n\n【72】    *   a.\n\n【73】        _Daily prednisone treatment_\n\n【74】    *   b.\n\n【75】        _Aspirin, 81 mg/d_\n\n【76】    *   c.\n\n【77】        _Periodic ESR monitoring_\n\n【78】    *   d.\n\n【79】        _Annual chest radiography_\n\n【80】    *   e.\n\n【81】        _Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin_\n\n【82】Prednisone (40-60 mg/d) is the first-line therapy for GCA. Initiation of corticosteroid therapy is encouraged before obtaining the confirmatory biopsy specimen to prevent visual complications. The incidence of visual loss after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy is approximately 6%.\n\n【83】Without corticosteroids, 50% of patients with GCA experience visual changes, and 10% to 50% can have a degree of visual loss. In retrospective studies, the use of daily aspirin in patients with GCA was associated with a lower incidence of cerebrovascular ischemic events.\n\n【84】Remission and relapse of GCA after the initiation of treatment is gauged symptomatically and by monitoring ESR. In approximately 15% of GCA cases, the aorta and aortic root are involved, and the condition itself is associated with the development of thoracic aortic aneurysms.\n\n【85】To that end, yearly monitoring with chest radiography is recommended. Some physicians choose to monitor such cases with serial CT of the chest. The use of warfarin was not associated with a significantly decreased incidence of ischemic cerebrovascular events compared with daily aspirin.\n\n【86】The patient began taking 60 mg/d of prednisone and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. Her delirium and muscle weakness improved during the next month. On follow-up examination 3 months later, the patient was noted to be much more alert, conversant, and cognizant on examination than during her previous admission. She was able to give a concise history. Moreover, she had no visual deficits or weakness. Her ESR and CRP levels had returned to normal range.\n\n【87】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【88】Giant cell arteritis is a chronic vasculitis of medium and large vessels. It is commonly seen in individuals older than 50 years and of Scandinavian descent. An epidemiological study in Olmsted County revealed an annual incidence of 1 in 4200 people older than 60 years.\n\n【89】The classic presentation of GCA is fever and headache with localization to the temporal region in a patient older than 50 years. Physicians are taught to quickly recognize this typical pattern and intervene to prevent the dreaded complication of vision loss. However, the clinician should also be aware of atypical presentations. In an evaluation of 463 patients with GCA presenting to Mayo Clinic, 2 had confirmed intracranial arterial involvement.\n\n【90】The symptoms of these 2 patients included progressive deterioration of memory, stupor, confusion, and extremity weakness.\n\n【91】Laboratory evaluation for GCA usually reveals a substantially elevated ESR; normochromic, normocytic anemia; and a mild leukocytosis. The criterion standard for diagnosing GCA remains temporal artery biopsy, which typically reveals vasculitic changes with multinucleated giant cells in the arterial wall, predominantly in the media near the internal elastic lamina. However, treatment should not be delayed in the setting of high clinical suspicion. The diagnosis can still be made on the basis of pathologic findings after several days of treatment with corticosteroids. In patients with high clinical suspicion of GCA and negative findings on unilateral temporal artery biopsy, a biopsy of the contralateral side should be performed. Pathologic changes can be focal, with areas of normal vessel anatomy within wider areas of vasculitic changes, necessitating resections at least 2.5 cm in length for adequate evaluation.\n\n【92】Corticosteroid therapy remains the standard treatment for GCA. In a widely used regimen, prednisone therapy is initiated at 40 to 60 mg/d, and the dose is gradually tapered on the basis of the clinical condition and the level of inflammatory markers. Treatment generally needs to be continued for 2 years on the basis of improvement in constitutional symptoms, vascular symptoms, and ESR. Adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid treatment, such as hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of infections, need to be taken into consideration. To decrease unwarranted adverse effects, corticosteroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and anti—tumor necrosis factor α monoclonal antibody therapy are occasionally used. Daily low-dose aspirin has been suggested to decrease the incidence of cranial ischemic events.\n\n【93】Yearly chest radiography is also recommended to monitor for the development of a thoracic aortic aneurysm.\n\n【94】Giant cell arteritis is the most common systemic vasculitis affecting elderly patients in Western countries. The classic presentation of GCA with headache and visual symptoms is well recognized, but it is also important to make the diagnosis when patients present with atypical symptoms such as those of our patient. Although atypical symptoms are rare, recognizing and treating patients with atypical presentations can lead to a substantial decrease in morbidity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, a simple self-administered tool of proven validity and reliability, is a commonly used screening instrument for depression in primary care practice. This review article provides a system-based approach to depression management using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 to guide clinicians in the identification and treatment of depression and its follow-up care.\n\n【1】DSM-IV ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) ), PHQ-9 ( Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ), STAR\\*D ( Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression )\n\n【2】Primary care physicians are more likely to see patients with depression than with any other disorder except hypertension. Depression has been ranked as the leading cause of disability and premature death among people aged 18 to 44 worldwide and is expected to be the second leading cause of disability for people of all ages by 2020.\n\n【3】It occurs twice as frequently in women as men. Although depression can begin at any age, its average age of onset is the mid-20s. Those who experience depressed moods when younger are at risk of developing depressive disorder later in life.\n\n【4】Heritability has been estimated to range from 30% to 40%.\n\n【5】As a larger proportion of the population reaches age 65 and over, depression among the elderly is becoming a major public health problem. Primarily affecting those with chronic medical illnesses and cognitive impairment, it compounds the morbidity caused by these conditions, leading to family disruption, disability, and increased mortality. Its incidence and prevalence double in those aged 70 to 85 years.\n\n【6】Depression is becoming widely characterized as a chronic disorder, along with diabetes, hypertension, and asthma, based partly on its high recurrence rate. Approximately half of those who are diagnosed as having depression experience a recurrence within 2 years, and more than 80% within 5 to 7 years.\n\n【7】A crucial aspect of its epidemiology is the increased mortality associated with major depression. A recent meta-analysis of 25 studies, in which more than 100,000 persons were followed up for periods ranging from 1.3 to 18.0 years, reported an overall relative risk of dying of 1.81 (95% confidence interval, 1.58-2.07) for persons with vs those without depression. Unfortunately, depression remains an often undiagnosed and undertreated condition. Of the 12 million people in the United States with major depression, only 46% to 57% are receiving treatment and only 18% to 25% are adequately treated.\n\n【8】The epidemiology of major depressive disorder: results from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication NCS-R).\n\n【9】The US Preventive Services Task Force has therefore recommended systematic screening for depression in clinical settings with appropriate systems in place to ensure effective treatment and follow-up.\n\n【10】Screening for depression in adults: a summary of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n\n【11】This concise review is meant to serve as a simple reference to assist primary care physicians in their management of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) as both a screening instrument and a means of monitoring progress towards recovery.\n\n【12】SCREENING FOR DEPRESSION\n------------------------\n\n【13】Identification of persons at risk for depression poses a challenge for a busy practice. To be useful, a screening tool must be simple to use, inexpensive, and accurate. A commonly used screening tool in primary care practice with proven validity and reliability is the PHQ-9 ; the 9 items on this instrument are based on the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders_ Fourth Edition ( _DSM-IV_ ) diagnostic criteria.\n\n【14】The PHQ-9 has been used to screen for depression in patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disease, as well as in ethnically diverse population groups.\n\n【15】Cost-effectiveness of collaborative care for chronically ill patients with comorbid depressive disorder in the general hospital setting, a randomised controlled trial.\n\n【16】Its usefulness in assessing depression severity and monitoring treatment response are well established.\n\n【17】To meet _DSM-IV_ criteria for depression diagnosis, the patient must respond affirmatively to at least 1 of the first 2 items on the test (little interest or pleasure in doing things; feeling down, depressed, or hopeless), indicating that the symptom has been present more than half the time in the past 2 weeks, as well as score positively on some of the other 7 questions. A score of 10 or above is often used as the cutoff for a clinical diagnosis of majordepression and as an indication for the initiation of therapy. At these cutoff scores, the instrument has been shown to have a sensitivity and specificity for depression of 88%.\n\n【18】FIGURE 1 Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 copyright 1999 Pfizer Inc. All rights reserved. Reproduced with permission.\n\n【19】As a screening instrument, however, it cannot replace sound clinical judgment. Before deciding on treatment, the clinician must carefully evaluate those with scores indicative of depression for coexisting situational issues such as suicidal thoughts; substance use; medical illnesses presenting with anergy, insomnia, or anorexia; or comorbid psychiatric condition. Furthermore, the limitations of the self-reporting of depressive symptoms should be considered when using the PHQ-9. Studies have shown that the personality traits of patients can lead to discrepancies between self-reported ratings and a more objective assessment by a clinician, ie, those obtained via a structured clinical interview.\n\n【20】Multimodal assessment of depressive symptoms may be more appropriate in certain settings.\n\n【21】Although designed to be completed by the patient before or during the office visit, the PHQ-9 can also be administered by the physician or designated clinical staff member depending on practice protocols. A very flexible tool, PHQ-9 can be used indirectly (eg, via telephone) or directly at a face-to-face visit; evidence of this flexibility was provided by a large study conducted in Europe which showed a congruence between self-administered and telephone-administered PHQ-9.\n\n【22】For screening alone, the first 2 items (“In the past 2 weeks, have you been down or depressed?”; “Have you had little interest or pleasure in doing things you normally enjoy?”), known as the PHQ-2, have been shown to be very useful in deciding who is at risk.\n\n【23】Some practices rely on the PHQ-2 for general screening, only using the full PHQ-9 with someone who has risk factors and/or screens positive on the PHQ-2. However, as noted by the preventive task force, _screening alone is not enough_ . Each practice must work out the logistics of administering the tool and initiating depression management considering available resources and practice preferences.\n\n【24】MANAGEMENT OF DEPRESSION\n------------------------\n\n【25】Depression management can be usefully divided into 3 phases: initiation of treatment, continuation, and follow-up/maintenance. The initial goal in the first phase of depression management is to minimize depressive symptoms and achieve remission. The MacArthur Foundation and others have linked severity scores on the PHQ-9 with suggested interventions . On the basis of the obtained score, a clinician may adopt a step-up approach to treatment selection, beginning with supportive counseling and progressing, if necessary, along the spectrum to a combination treatment with antidepressants and psychotherapy. Again, these are general guidelines developed to assist a clinician in structuring conversation with the patient about possible interventions. To facilitate the tracking of patient progress, the PHQ-9 should be entered in the medical record in a manner that allows for easy retrieval, ideally in the form of a patient registry.\n\n【26】TABLE 1 Applying Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) Scores to Practice\n\n| PHQ-9 score | Severity/provisional diagnosis | Treatment recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| <5 | Community norm | No action recommended |\n| 5-9 | Mild symptoms | Watchful waiting, self-management education, periodic rescreening |\n| 10-14 | Major depression, mild | Pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy, creation of a treatment and follow-up plan, education, reevaluation |\n| 15-19 | Major depression, moderately severe | Immediate institution of treatment (pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy) |\n| ≥20 | Major depression, severe | Pharmacotherapy AND psychotherapy, referral |\n\n【28】Adapted from MacArthur Initiative on Depression and Primary Care, with permission.\n\n【29】### Pharmacological Management\n\n【30】The decision to use antidepressant agents should be made jointly by the clinician and the patient. Some factors to consider in drug selection include patient preferences, potential drug-drug interactions, insurance limitations, and adverse effects. Patients with major depression should remain on a successful medication regimen for at least 6 months for the first episode and longer for subsequent episodes; it is therefore critical that they are able to tolerate and afford that period of treatment. Patient involvement and education are key factors in treatment adherence. A step-up dosing schedule can be helpful in minimizing adverse effects; initial doses should also be lower for elderly patients and those with hepatic or renal impairment.

Clinicians should recognize that no one treatment is universally effective and that many depressed patients do not experience satisfactory clinical benefit from initial treatment. The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR\\*D) study, sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health, confirmed that several sequential treatment steps are often needed to obtain remission. However, when more treatment steps are required, short-term remission rates decline and relapse rates increase during the follow-up phase.\n\n【43】Acute and longer-term outcomes in depressed outpatients requiring one or several treatment steps: a STAR\\*D report.\n\n【44】Those who do not respond to the “first step” of a step-up treatment approach can be more easily identified when patient responses can be documented within 4 to 6 weeks of initiating medications or 8 to 12 weeks of initiating psychotherapy. These patients can then be moved to the next step, which may involve a simple change of medication or the referral to a mental health professional.\n\n【45】### Psychotherapy\n\n【46】Psychotherapy can reduce depressive symptoms, improve function, and prevent relapse in patients with major depression.\n\n【47】Randomized trial of behavioral activation, cognitive therapy, and antidepressant medication in the acute treatment of adults with major depresson.\n\n【48】Access to a psychotherapist, however, can pose a challenge in many health care systems. Two proposed solutions are the administration of cognitive-behavioral therapy by telephone and the training of nurses to act as care managers, providing focused care using concepts of behavioral activation.\n\n【49】Combined treatment with pharmacological agents is recommended for those with partial or no response to 12 weeks of psychological counseling, those with severe depression, or those with a prior chronic courseof illness. Patient preferences (specific gender, specific therapist in mind), health plan restrictions, and out-of-pocket costs should be considered in the selection of a psychotherapist.\n\n【50】### Clinical Guidelines\n\n【51】Guidelines have been developed to facilitate the incorporation of the principles of evidence-based medicine into depression identification and management. Prominent examples that target the primary care population are the MacArthur Foundation toolkit , the _Guideline for Major Depression in Adults in Primary Care_ of the Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement , and the _Guideline for Depression_ of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which has been implemented throughout Britain .\n\n【52】In choosing a guideline, the primary care practitioner should assess the quality and currency of the guideline and its relevance to the practice. Once a guideline is chosen, the next challenge is to ensure that practitioners remember to use it. Those practices with electronic medical records have the opportunity to embed flags or reminders about steps in a guideline into their daily practice. Implementation in practices without electronic records will be more challenging.\n\n【53】### Follow-up Frequency\n\n【54】The aims of treatment in the continuation and maintenance treatment phases are to prevent relapse in the short-term and the return of any new episodes in the long-term. Nearly half of patients who receive an initial prescription for an antidepressant discontinue treatment during the first month; few receive the recommended levels of follow-up care.\n\n【55】Frequent contacts during follow-up have been associatedwith better outcome. Patients should be seen 2 to 4 weeks after starting therapy to assess medication acceptance and response, reinforce educational messages, and address adverse effects and suicide risk. After the initial identification of a depressed patient, 3 contacts within 12 weeks are considered ideal.\n\n【56】The PHQ-9 should be administered during these follow-up visits to monitor patient progress. Studies that investigated the sensitivity of the PHQ-9 to change have shown that the measure is responsive to pharmacological and psychosocial interventions.\n\n【57】Changes in the PHQ-9 scores after treatment with antidepressant agents correspond with clinician ratings of patient responses to treatment.\n\n【58】Practice models will dictate who will see the patient on follow-up and whether follow-up can be conducted through nonvisit care. For instance, under the collaborative care model described below, follow-ups are performed by the care manager with case supervision by a psychiatrist and/or primary care physician.\n\n【59】Using the PHQ-9 to assess treatment response , clinicians can classify and manage patients as follows: complete response/remission, in which case therapy should be continued for at least 6 months; partial response, in which case a higher dose of the same agent should be used or a second agent or psychotherapy added; and no response, in which case a switch should be made to a different category of drug or to psychotherapy.\n\n【60】TABLE 4 Using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to Assess Initial Treatment Response\n\n【61】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【62】Goal of the initial phase of treatment is remission, defined as a PHQ-9 score of less than 5.\n\n【63】After 4 to 6 Weeks of Adequate Pharmacotherapy\n\n| PHQ-9 score | Treatment response | Recommended action |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Decrease of 5 points or more from baseline | Adequate or complete | Do not change treatment; conduct periodic follow-up |\n| Decrease of 2 to 4 points from baseline | Partial | Reconfirm diagnosis; consider comorbid conditions; increase dose of same agent or add second agent |\n| Decrease of 1 point or no change/increase in score | Poor or none | Reconfirm diagnosis; consider comorbid conditions; augment medication; switch medication; obtain psychiatric consultation; add psychological counseling |\n\n【65】Adapted from MacArthur Initiative on Depression and Primary Care, with permission.\n\n【66】\\* Goal of the initial phase of treatment is remission, defined as a PHQ-9 score of less than 5.\n\n【67】Indefinite antidepressant therapy should be discussed with patients who have additional risk factors such as 2 or more prior episodes of depression in 5 years, an initial episode after age 50, and difficult-to-treat episodes.\n\n【68】The _collaborative care model_ , a structured approach to care based on chronic disease management principles, involves allied specialists, such as registered nurses, who act as care managers and work in conjunction with the primary care physician and mental health specialist. This model uses a care manager and creates a collaborative relationship between a primary care practice and a psychiatrist; other critical components include the use of a screening instrument, the establishment of a registry where results can be entered and patients followed, and the use of evidence-based guidelines. Substantial evidence has shown this model to be more effective than standard care in improving short-term and long-term depression outcomes.\n\n【69】Collaborative care management of late-life depression in the primary care setting: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【70】The system of care included in a collaborative model addresses weaknesses in systems that only screen for depression and do not follow up on those who have been identified or who have dropped out of care. A more detailed discussion of the model is beyond the scope of this paper.\n\n【71】REFERRALS FOR PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION\n------------------------------------\n\n【72】Although primary care clinicians capably manage more than 75% of patients with depression, referral for psychiatric evaluation is recommended in the following patients: those with a history of psychosis or who are suspected of having a primary psychotic disorder, those with a history of bipolar disorder or with symptoms of mania, those who have substantial trouble tolerating medication adverse effects, those whose depression has not responded to 2 adequate trials of antidepressants, those with complex comorbid medical conditions that complicate a choice of antidepressant, and those with complex comorbid mental conditions and/or a substance abuse problem.\n\n【73】Patients with positive scores on the 9th item of PHQ-9 should be assessed further by their primary care team for suicidal risk. Immediate psychiatric evaluation or emergency referral for hospitalization is necessary whenever there is _imminent_ danger that patients will harm themselves. Clarifying which patients are in imminent danger of suicide is a clinical decision best made by the practitioner directly involved with the patient. In making that determination, the practitioner should consider whether patients are preoccupied with or have thoughts about suicide, have stated their intent to act on those thoughts, have access to lethal means, and have a history of suicide attempts.\n\n【74】Patients who are deemed to be imminently at risk should be moved to a safe environment. A collaborative relationship between the mental health specialist and the primary care physician will help facilitate prompt intervention and ensure patient safety, particularly around this issue. An additional resource for patients and their families is the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline .\n\n【75】PATIENT EDUCATION\n-----------------\n\n【76】Success in depression management largely depends on enabling patients to be active participants in their care process. Clinicians can help by providing educational materials or directing patients to available resources. They can also remind patients that depression, like asthma or diabetes, is a chronic and recurring disorder, the management of which requires their participation. They can educate patients regarding their medication, letting them know that 2 to 4 weeks of drug therapy may be needed before symptoms improve and alerting them to any potential adverse effects. They can remind them of the importance of taking their medication daily, continuing their medication for at least 6 months after they are feeling better, and consulting their physician if adverse effects or other problems with medication occur or before changing the dosage of or discontinuing medication. Finally, patients should be advised of the importance of eating a healthy diet, avoiding alcohol, and obtaining enough sleep.\n\n【77】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【78】Depression is the second most common reason for consultation in primary care practice but still remains frequently undiagnosed and undertreated. The PHQ-9 is a validated and reliable tool that the primary care physician can use to diagnose and treat depression and to monitor progress. A score of 10 or higher is used as the cutoff for a clinical diagnosis of depression and as an indication of the need to begin therapy. However, the PHQ-9 is intended only as a tool to facilitate clinical decision making and does not replace sound medical judgment. The goal of the initial treatment phase is to achieve remission either by pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or a combination of modalities. Clinical guidelines have been developed to provide clinicians with management algorithms. Continuation and maintenance phases aim at preventing relapse and lifelong recurrence; the PHQ-9 score can guide clinicians on treatment modifications and the need for referrals for psychiatric evaluation. Frequent follow-ups have been associated with better outcomes; 3 contacts within the 12 weeks after initial diagnosis are considered ideal.\n\n【79】Decisions regarding screening and follow-up—ie, where, how, and by whom the follow-up will be conducted—will be made by practices on the basis of their individual needs. The collaborative care model appears to be the most effective for depression management in primary care and addresses system weaknesses, particularly those associated with follow-up care.\n\n【80】In screening for depression, clinicians should particularly assess for suicidal risk; certain factors can help identify those at imminent risk of suicide.

The British Postmaster General briefly allowed the logo “Pears’ Soap” to be added to the reverse of sheets of the United Kingdom’s 1881 1d. (Scott 89) and 1887 Jubilee ½ d. (Scott 111) stamps issued in 1889, but the experiment was soon discontinued, in part because the contracted printer found it difficult to produce the text consistently. Despite the failure of the British test, the New Zealand post office tried a similar approach 4 years later. Stamps with advertisements on the reverse are sometimes called “underprints” or “backprints,” in contrast to the much more common “overprints,” on which postal administrations have added words or designs to the visible front side of existing stamps.\n\n【1】When New Zealand backprinted stamps debuted in February 1893, advertised products included: Beecham’s pills (a laxative developed in England in the 1840s); Beecham’s toothpaste; Wertheim sewing machines; Sunlight laundry soap; Cadbury’s cocoa, Fry’s cocoa powder; Lattey, Livermore & Company’s imported Ceylon tea; Kaitangata coal; Poneke beef extract; and Bonnington’s Irish Moss cough syrup. Like the British backprints, the New Zealand philatelic advertising experiment was short-lived, but many more examples of the New Zealand stamps were printed, and a large number survive today. A 1998 _Health and Hygiene_ article related one potential reason for the New Zealand postal advertising failure: “Rival advertising agencies promoted a rumor that the dye of the advertisement when licked was injurious to health.”\n\n【2】The most controversial underprint advertisement in the New Zealand series was for “Macbean Stewart’s New Cure for Asthma, Diphtheria, and Croup” . Newspaper advertisements for this alleged respiratory panacea, which was “prepared from the mountain and forest plants of New Zealand,” and manufactured by the Sharland & Company chemists in Auckland, had already been appearing for several years when the stamp debuted. Print advertisements for Dr Macbean Stewart’s “cure” often included testimonials from a police sergeant, a local political leader, and a gardener . Some of the newspaper advertisements also began with a Maori language quotation, perhaps to suggest that the product’s plant mixture was influenced by traditional Polynesian medicinal lore, though the specific ingredients were never disclosed.\n\n【3】Figure 1 Advertisement for Dr Macbean Stewart’s herbal medication on the reverse of an 1893 New Zealand 2-pence “second sideface series” definitive stamp (Scott 62). The stamp’s violet obverse bears an image of Queen Victoria in profile. The depicted example was used postally in 1895, and was postmarked in Dunedin, on the South Island of New Zealand.\n\n【4】Figure 2 An 1891 newspaper advertisement for Dr Macbean Stewart’s “asthma cure,” accompanied by testimonials. The advertisement also lists “asthma tobacco” and a brand of gumweed cigarillos for sale. During the 19 <sup>th </sup> century, many physicians thought smoking tobacco was beneficial for pulmonary diseases. A typical daily wage for a laborer in the 1890s in New Zealand was 6 to 8 shillings per day, so the cost of Macbean Stewart’s asthma cure represented about one-half-day’s wages. Image source: _Grey River Argus_ (Greymouth, New Zealand) _,_ Volume 32, 27 November 1891, page 4.\n\n【5】Contemporary physicians had a strongly negative reaction to these advertisements, due to both the secrecy about the ingredients and the manufacturer’s false promise of a “cure” for such a wide variety of respiratory diseases with differing etiology. An editorial in the _Australasian Medical Gazette_ in July 1889 compared Dr Macbean Stewart’s medicine to the Chamberlain family’s infamous century-long failure to disclose their invention of obstetrical forceps, despite the potential benefit of disclosure to humanity: “We feel that, in quoting the Chamberlains in juxtaposition to Francis MacBean Stewart … we are bestowing unmerited distinction on the latter, who, much to our surprise, we find is on the staff of the Christchurch Hospital.” The Royal College of Surgeons wrote to Dr Macbean Stewart in 1890, demanding an explanation for his overpromising advertisements. Similarly, several physicians sent letters to the _British Medical Journal_ in 1892, complaining about the Macbean Stewart newsprint advertisements.\n\n【6】In response to this criticism, Dr Macbean Stewart promised to stop selling his asthma cure. But the 1893 underprinted postage stamps and newspaper advertisements that continued to appear until the late 1890s demonstrated that he did not keep his promise.\n\n【7】Francis Macbean Stewart  was born in Dundee, Scotland, in 1838, and spent much of his childhood living with an uncle near Loch Ness. He enrolled at Edinburgh University to study medicine in 1855. While still a student, he sailed to the Arctic several times between 1859 and 1863 on the whaling and sealing ship _Narwhal,_ acting as the ship’s surgeon. On his final expedition, his legs were severely damaged by frostbite. During testimony 3 decades later to a board of inquiry concerning the asthma “cure,” Macbean Stewart stated that his previously injured legs were worsening with time, and he worried he would eventually be unable to work, so he allowed his name to be put on the patent medicine to provide his wife and family some financial security.\n\n【8】Figure 3 Images of Dr Francis Macbean Stewart at different stages of his career.

Christchurch, New Zealand: The Cyclopedia Company, 1903.\n\n【9】In 1864, he finished his training and was licensed by the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh. Dr Macbean Stewart began a surgical practice in Inverness, where he was the surgical consultant to a dispensary, served as the local health inspector of shipping, and was appointed as a military surgeon to the Cameron Highlanders regiment. For two years in the early 1870s, he was the ship surgeon on the _S.S. Carpentaria_ , a mail boat running between Glasgow and New York.\n\n【10】Dr Macbean Stewart moved to New Zealand in 1873, initially settling in the South Island gold prospecting town of Milton, where he married Annie Stevens Farr (1852-1926), the daughter of a prominent Christchurch architect who had introduced the bumblebee to New Zealand. In 1876, the young couple moved to the South Island village of Ashburton, where Dr Macbean Stewart became a leader in the local Presbyterian Church and the Caledonian Society for Scottish immigrants. He was also a member of the Ancient Order of Druids. Their first child of an eventual six died in infancy; their second child, Douglas, born in 1877, was later killed in the World War I battle of Gallipoli in 1915.\n\n【11】In 1881, Dr Macbean Stewart and his family moved to Christchurch, where he served as an honorary consulting surgeon at Christchurch Hospital for 12 years. The hospital was quite small at that time and had only 2 consulting surgeons. The other surgeon, Irish immigrant Dr Courtney Nedwell, appears to have been a rival. In 1884, Dr Nedwell criticized Macbean Stewart’s operating practices following an unsuccessful hernia repair during which the patient died of peritonitis. This resulted in a formal inquiry, in which Dr Macbean Stewart was exonerated and ultimately allowed to resume practice.\n\n【12】During his career, Dr Macbean Stewart was known for advocating inspection of slaughterhouses and dairies, and he also favored women’s suffrage. In 1893, New Zealand became the first self-governing country in the world to give women the right to vote in national elections. He died in 1906, following an operation to remove a tumor on his eye, and was given a Highland-style funeral by the local Caledonian Society.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

They bring forth valuable contributions to pain management in a subset of patients with liver disease who require palliative care, which we did not differentiate adequately. Because our article was intended to be an overview of outpatient (and/or transient inpatient) pain management, admittedly we did not address the extremes of pain management discussed in the letter by Swetz et al. Our goal was to provide clinicians with a broad approach to cirrhotic patients with pain (patients with abdominal pain, headaches, and joint pain, as well as those with more severe chronic pain). Given that we did not address end-of-life care or palliative care in our article, we appreciate the perspectives of Swetz et al.\n\n【1】To be clear to readers, although palliative care is most often thought of as end-of-life care in the medical community, it can also refer to palliation of symptoms, even in patients with ongoing aggressive medical care. This latter group is a smaller population of cirrhotic patients that we did not specifically address but whose condition is extremely difficult to manage. Obviously, with end-of-life care, opioids should be used with the goal of pain management regardless of underlying disease etiology. We would never advocate for stopping use of opioids in this population. Certainly, precipitating hepatic encephalopathy would be less of a concern in that patient population as long as the patient and family are well informed. However, the use of opioids in patients undergoing active aggressive medical care but also needing hospice or palliative care requires close monitoring for encephalopathy. The two studies on treating this group of patients, as quoted by Swetz et al, describe the same end-stage liver disease patient population at the University of California San Diego enrolled in a hospice program, but receiving aggressive medical care.\n\n【2】The utility of the model for end-stage liver disease score: a reliable guide for liver transplant candidacy and, for select patients, simultaneous hospice referral.\n\n【3】Of the 157 patients with end-stage liver disease admitted to the hospice service, 8 (5%) were awaiting liver transplant, 6 of whom underwent transplant. The remaining patients received hospice care. Of the 157 patients, 30% developed hepatic encephalopathy while undergoing expert care and careful scrutiny.\n\n【4】Swetz et al rightly point out that a practitioner reading the abstract of our article in isolation may erroneously assume that opioids are to be avoided at all costs, whereas our argument is simply that they are second-line choices, as better outlined in the body of our article. Opioids should be avoided until first-line agents (eg, acetaminophen) have been tried and have failed. Opioids should be administered judiciously when used. It was not our intention to suggest that patients with liver disease and chronic unremitting pain should suffer through pain unnecessarily. Patients with cirrhosis are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of opioids (not applicable to the end-of-life patient). One of the most common complications of end-stage liver disease is hepatic encephalopathy, which, in inexperienced hands, can be fatal. Common precipitants of encephalopathy are sedatives and opioids. As hepatologists, we see this complication _very_ often. We maintain that if a (nonpalliative) patient with cirrhosis exhibits changes consistent with encephalopathy, immediate discontinuation of the opioid is necessary to avoid clinical deterioration, because encephalopathy is life threatening and must be treated first. Once the patient is clinically stable, resumption of opioids at lower dosing or longer intervals may be necessary, but inpatient monitoring would be required for safe dosing schedules (which was mentioned in our article). In our opinion, reliance on naloxone to manage excess sedation from opioids is impractical (with significant risk) in the outpatient setting and should be reserved for inpatients in extreme pain. Although helpful for oversedation, naloxone should not be expected to treat or reverse encephalopathy. The cited article in question also states “if acetaminophen is ineffective, opioids could be administered with careful monitoring for encephalopathy,” and the authors advocate the avoidance of opioids in the setting of hepatic encephalopathy (pages 2172 and 2173).\n\n【5】In addition, the cited article by Hirschfield et al comments on advocating for a lower dose and less frequent dosing of opiod therapy when alternative analgesia is not available, in the context of avoidance of encephalopathy as well, which is similar to our viewpoint.\n\n【6】Patients seen in the palliative care settings and chronic pain clinics are in extreme pain, and they _do_ need to be treated in a different manner than patients in outpatient medical clinics or in the main medical or surgical wards (the population for which our recommendations were directed). We agree with the optimal opioid choices (fentanyl and hydromorphone), as outlined by Swetz et al, and we concur with the strategy of careful titration of opioid dosing. Because our intention was to provide a practical approach to analgesia and because most patients with cirrhosis are managed in outpatient settings, intravenous fentanyl is not a feasible outpatient option. For a cirrhotic patient in extreme pain, inpatient management, in which careful monitoring and expert supervision can occur, is most appropriate, and we should have been more clear in our article on this point. The input of Swetz et al is valuable for patients with advanced liver disease in extreme pain. Our main point is that opioid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used as first-line pain control agents because of a misconception about acetaminophen safety in patients with liver disease. We hope our reply diminishes any confusion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Patient and procedural characteristics were extracted using the _International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision_ codes provided in Supplemental Table 1 . Information on patient demographic characteristics were recorded for each hospital discharge, including age, sex, race, admission day (weekday or weekend), expected primary payer, and median household income according to zip code. Patients with missing data for age, sex, elective admission, weekend admission, and mortality status were excluded from the analysis. Patients with type 2 myocardial infarction (MI) or elective admissions were also excluded from the analysis . Each discharge record had information on up to 30 diagnoses. A full list of _International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification_ codes used to identify receipt of palliative care as well as other patient characteristics and complications is provided in Supplemental Table 1 . We also used _International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification_ codes to identify procedural information during hospitalization.\n\n【27】The main outcome measured was in-hospital all-cause mortality. Other outcomes included in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), acute ischemic cerebrovascular accident (CVA), and major bleeding. We defined MACCE as a composite of all-cause mortality and acute ischemic CVA or transient ischemic attack. Major bleeding events were defined as a composite of gastrointestinal, retroperitoneal, intracranial, and intracerebral hemorrhage; periprocedural hemorrhage; unspecified hemorrhage; or need for a blood transfusion. Destination of discharge and receipts of invasive procedures such as invasive coronary angiography (ICA), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), mechanical ventilation, and circulatory support were also measured.\n\n【28】Continuous variables are presented as median and interquartile range due to skewed data, and categorical data are presented as frequencies and percentages. Categorical variables were compared using the Pearson χ <sup>2 </sup> test, while continuous variables were compared using the Student _t_ test or the Mann-Whitney _U_ test, as appropriate. Sampling weights were used to calculate the estimated total discharges as specified by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between demographic characteristics and comorbidities and receipt of palliative care, as well as the association between receipt of palliative care and in-hospital outcomes and procedures among patients with DNR status, all expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% CIs. The models were adjusted for baseline differences between the groups, controlling for the following covariates: age; sex; weekend admission; hospital size (number of beds); region and location/teaching status; ST-elevation MI (STEMI); cardiogenic shock; use of intra-aortic balloon pump, CABG, PCI, or ICA; ventricular fibrillation; ventricular tachycardia; atrial fibrillation; heart failure; hypertension; dyslipidemia; diabetes mellitus; valvular heart disease; smoking status; chronic lung disease; chronic liver disease; chronic renal failure; anemia; obesity; thrombocytopenia; coagulopathies; and malignancies.\n\n【29】All statistical analyses were performed with IBM SPSS statistical software, version 26. Statistical significance was set at the 2-tailed _P_ \\=.05 level, without multiplicity adjustment.\n\n【30】Results\n-------\n\n【31】Between October 2015 and December 2018, 2,959,244 patients were admitted to US hospitals and during the hospitalization received a principal diagnosis of AMI. Application of relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria  produced a study cohort of 339,270 patients, 113,215 (33.4%) of whom received palliative care. Differences in clinical characteristics between the 2 groups (those with and without palliative care) at admission are presented in Table 1 . Recipients of palliative care were younger (median age, 81 vs 83 years; _P_ <.001), less likely to be female (57,626 of 113,215 \\[50.9%\\] vs 123,652 of 226,055 \\[54.7%\\]; _P_ <.001), less often White (89,664 of 113,215 \\[79.2%\\] vs 185,366 of 226,055 \\[82.0%\\]; _P_ <.001), and less likely to have Medicare insurance (92,096 of 113,215 \\[81.4%\\] vs 197,701 of 226,055 \\[87.7%\\]; _P_ <.001), while the highest proportion of patients receiving palliative care were admitted to large (61,703 of 113,215 \\[54.5%\\] vs 110,541 of 226,055 \\[48.9%\\]; _P_ <.001) and teaching (81,062 of 113,215 \\[71.6%\\] vs 142,640 of 226,055 \\[63.1%\\]; _P_ <.001) hospitals.

First, only 1 of 3 patients in this heterogeneous group received palliative care. Second, patients less frequently received palliative care if they were female or presented with cardiovascular risk factors including previous MI, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, or smoking, whereas they were more likely to receive palliative care if they had comorbidities including heart failure, malignancy (solid or hematologic), or metastatic cancer. Third, they were less likely to obtain palliative care if they presented at a small hospital compared with a medium or large hospital or presented to a rural hospital compared with a suburban or teaching hospital. Fourth, patients who were in receipt of palliative care were less likely to receive in-hospital procedures including ICA and PCI. Finally, patients with a DNR status who obtained palliative care had increased adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality, acute ischemic CVA, major bleeding, and MACCE.\n\n【59】Our study identified several patient-related characteristics that were associated with palliative care use, including ventricular arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock or arrest, STEMI, and malignancy. It is likely that physicians recognize these high-risk factors and subsequently provide palliative care to these patients. Importantly, the frequency of patients receiving circulatory support or mechanical ventilation was significantly higher in the cohort that received palliative care. This is an unexpected finding because one of the key principles of palliative care is de-escalation of treatments. Thus, it is possible that this finding is a reflection of treatment failures. This finding raises questions about the appropriateness of such interventions when it may have been more appropriate to get early involvement with palliative care.\n\n【60】Our analysis, like that of others, revealed that both the size and type of hospital played an important role in which patients received palliative care. Patients in teaching and urban hospitals were more likely to receive palliative care than those in rural ones. Access to palliative care has been found to be an important proxy outcome measure to determine the quality of care patients receive prior to death, such that in 2014 the World Health Organization made a global resolution to improve palliative care access as a core component of health care.\n\n【61】Although access to health care is both a complex and multidimensional concept,\n\n【62】What does 'access to health care' mean?\n\n【63】it is likely that institutional factors and geography are implicated in less frequent palliative care in patients who were treated in rural and small hospitals. Chukwusa et al found considerable variations in geographic access to inpatient hospice, with evidence that patients who lived further away from hospice locations were less likely to die in a hospice facility. There may be both a lack of availability of palliative care and awareness of the need for this care in the AMI population. Observations that this disparity of care exists for this heterogeneous group of patients with AMI are an important step forward because better access to palliative care is likely to reduce this disparity gap.\n\n【64】Our analysis demonstrates that sex disparities exist, with women who have a DNR status being less likely than their male counterparts to receive a palliative care consultation. This finding is surprising because another recent study in an unselected cohort of patients with AMI reported that females were more likely to receive palliative care.\n\n【65】Similarly, Saeed et al reported that in patients diagnosed with cancer, women were significantly more likely to prefer palliative care than men, whereas a multisite prospective cohort study by Sharma et al\n\n【66】found that men with cancer were more likely to receive aggressive nonbeneficial intensive care near the end of their life. We previously reported that females who were diagnosed with AMI were more likely than men to have a DNR order.\n\n【67】Predictors, treatments, and outcomes of do-not-resuscitate status in acute myocardial infarction patients (from a nationwide inpatient cohort study).\n\n【68】In this high-risk cohort of patients, it is likely that there is a complex interplay between a person’s own wishes and priorities toward the end of their life. Given that the presentation and perception of the symptoms of AMI differ between the sexes, it is possible that this may also be a factor in the differences of management.\n\n【69】Sex differences in the presentation and perception of symptoms among young patients with myocardial infarction: evidence from the VIRGO study (Variation in Recovery: Role of Gender on Outcomes of Young AMI Patients).\n\n【70】It is important to recognize that there are differences in the use of palliative care in this cohort based on race. In our study, patients who were Black and Asian/Pacific Islander were more likely to receive palliative care consultation than White patients, whereas Hispanic patients were less likely to receive such care than White patients. In a previous population-based study of 1212 patients, Ornstein et al\n\n【71】Evaluation of racial disparities in hospice use and end-of-life treatment intensity in the REGARDS cohort.\n\n【72】found that Black individuals were significantly less likely to use hospice and more likely to undergo intensive treatment in the last 6 months of their lives than White individuals regardless of cause of death. Although patient preference and cultural differences are a key factor in differences in the use of palliative care, it is reassuring to see that in this high-risk cohort of patients, Black individuals are not disadvantaged in the receipt of palliative care.\n\n【73】Although the AMI cohort of patients who have a DNR order represents a group that generally has poor outcomes and is less likely to receive invasive management compared with those without a DNR order,\n\n【74】Predictors, treatments, and outcomes of do-not-resuscitate status in acute myocardial infarction patients (from a nationwide inpatient cohort study).\n\n【75】our analysis revealed that patients who receive palliative care are even less likely to undergo invasive management. One of the key facets of palliative care is “active listening,” in which equal importance is placed on patients’ attitude regarding their condition and understanding their fears, concerns, and priorities.\n\n【76】Quality of care and satisfaction with care on palliative care units.\n\n【77】In conditions such as heart failure and cancer, patients with advanced disease often have a preference to not be treated aggressively, with the focus on prioritizing their quality of life.\n\n【78】Physician and patient characteristics associated with more intensive end-of-life care.\n\n【79】Our results suggest a similar pattern in this high-risk cohort of patients with AMI in which the focus of management is likely to be patient-centered and less focused on interventions that prolong life. The clinical outcomes for patients with AMI including mortality, acute ischemic CVA, major bleeding, and MACCE were significantly worse in patients who received palliative care. This finding is likely multifactorial and in part may be that the patients receiving palliative care are likely to represent a more unwell group of patients who would generally have worse clinical outcomes and may thus be less likely to be offered life-prolonging–focused interventions.\n\n【80】Importantly, our study does not have temporal data on the timing of the DNR order, receipt of palliative care, or its relationship with the timing of the AMI. Thus, it is important to recognize that the group of patients who received palliative care in this cohort reflects a highly heterogeneous group of patients. For instance, patients may range from those who had a multimorbidity burden and a preexisting DNR order who were subsequently hospitalized with a noncardiac cause and had an AMI in the hospital to those who were previously well, were admitted to the hospital with an AMI, and initiated a DNR order and palliative care in the hospital following a catastrophic complication. Thus, there exists a highly complex interplay of the receipt of palliative care and its timing in relationship to both a DNR order and the timing of the AMI. For many conditions such as cancer, the initiation of a DNR order has become synonymous with the involvement of palliative care and recognition that the priority of care for the patient and their families should be switched to prioritizing comfort.\n\n【81】Importantly, this relationship has not been well defined for AMI, and differences are likely given the varied patient populations and treatments in comparison to patients who have cancer.\n\n【82】Emergency department cardiovascular disease encounters and associated mortality in patients with cancer: a study of 20.6 million records from the USA.\n\n【83】Thus, our study raises questions about the timing of palliative care within the realms of AMI in view of the immediate lifesaving treatments available, particularly PCI for patients with STEMI. In the past decade, both DNR orders and palliative care have been used increasingly in an ICU setting, both for patients who are expected to die in the ICU and for those discharged either to home or to another department within the hospital, where early involvement has been found to be beneficial.\n\n【84】Given the parallels between ICU care and cardiac diseases, it is likely there are lessons to be learned on the timing of involvement of palliative care for patients with AMI by looking at successful use in the ICU.\n\n【85】Our analysis has important clinical implications for practice. Cardiology as a specialty has often been criticized for its reluctance to utilize palliative care, largely attributed to advances in cardiovascular sciences over the past 20 years that allow patients with advanced heart disease to survive events that previously would have been fatal.\n\n【86】Doctors' understanding of palliative care.\n\n【87】End-of-life situations in cardiology: a qualitative study of physicians' and nurses' experience in a large university hospital.\n\n【88】It is important to recognize that a DNR order only reflects the desires of a patient once they experience a full cardiopulmonary arrest and does not reflect their preferences about other forms of life-sustaining treatment. Thus, in this high-risk cohort of patients with poor outcomes, it is likely that increased use of palliative care will have significant benefits for patients and their families in deciding which treatments they would be willing to accept and focusing on their key priorities.\n\n【89】Of concern, the lower rates of discharge to home with home health care or to a nursing home suggests that in this cohort, palliative care was mostly being reserved as end-of-life care for those identified as at high risk of dying during that hospitalization. “Late” use of palliative care has been reported similarly by others, and cardiologists are increasingly being asked to reframe palliative care as a useful added layer of support for those with advanced illness, not just in the final weeks of life but potentially over months and years.\n\n【90】American Heart Association Advocacy Coordinating Committee. Palliative care and cardiovascular disease and stroke: a policy statement from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association.\n\n【91】There are several barriers to earlier referral,\n\n【92】Referral practices of cardiologists to specialist palliative care in Canada.\n\n【93】but greater education for physicians and integrated-care pathways with palliative care teams are likely to facilitate a more timely patient-centered approach.\n\n【94】This study has several strengths. Our analysis represents the largest study to date that examined the use of palliative care in a heterogeneous high-risk group of patients with a diagnosis of AMI who had a DNR status. The NIS database gives insight into the real-world in-hospital outcomes in a large and unselected cohort of patients with AMI, including those who are at high risk and have multiple comorbid illnesses, such that they are underrepresented in clinical trials. The size of the database provides sufficient power to detect differences in adverse outcomes between the 2 cohorts of interest.\n\n【95】Our study also has several important limitations. Despite the NIS using _International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision_ codes and being a validated data set for the purposes of cardiovascular research, it is an administrative data set, and coding error may be a source of bias. The identification of AMI, DNR status, palliative care, comorbidities, and procedural data was based on the use of administrative codes. Second, the NIS data set only records in-hospital outcomes, and therefore, longer-term follow-up of mortality or other adverse outcomes is missing from our analysis. Third, because the database does not include pharmacotherapy, we were unable to determine if there was a significant disparity in care between the 2 groups regarding pharmacotherapy or to see if the use of pharmacotherapy altered clinical outcomes for those patients with palliative care. Furthermore, the NIS does not capture when the DNR order was instituted, whether it was in place prior to admission,\n\n【96】Increase in the proportion of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction with do-not-resuscitate orders already in place between 2001 and 2007: a nonconcurrent prospective study.\n\n【97】at the point of admission, or during the inpatient episode following a complication/adverse outcome. Thus, the intention of the palliative care is unknown. Similarly, we do not know the timing of the palliative care in relationship to the diagnosis of AMI (even though there is a suggestion that it might be late) or to the DNR status. Importantly, we also don’t know whether receipt of palliative care means that patients received high-quality palliative care, nor that they received specialist palliative care consultation. It is also possible that unmeasured confounders such as frailty or malnutrition may contribute to the adverse association that we report in patients referred for palliative treatment. Finally, the process by which the palliative care was established and how patients’ preferences were elicited in decision making is unknown.\n\n【98】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【99】Our study found that in hospitalized patients who had a DNR status and received a diagnosis of AMI, only one-third received palliative care. Females, patients presenting at small or rural hospitals, and those with cardiovascular comorbidities were less likely to receive palliative care, whereas patients who had multiple comorbidities with heart failure or malignancy were more likely to receive palliative care. Patients who received palliative care had increased adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality, acute ischemic CVA, major bleeding, and MACCE. Further evaluation of the use of palliative care, particularly in patients who had a DNR order in place prior to admission with an AMI, is required to determine its appropriateness and to facilitate greater use in this high-risk cohort of patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Record abstraction was performed to select individuals with radiographic confirmation of rickets. Age- and sex-matched controls were identified for the evaluation of risk factors. The main outcome measure was radiographic evidence of rickets without identifiable inherited, genetic, or nonnutritional causes. Incidence rates were calculated using Rochester Epidemiology Project census data.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 768 children with eligible diagnostic codes, 23 had radiographic evidence of rickets; of these, 17 children had nutritional rickets.

Clinical presentation included poor growth (n=12), leg deformity (n=8), motor delay (n=5), leg pain (n=3), weakness (n=3), and hypocalcemia or tetany (n=2). The incidence of nutritional rickets in children younger than 3 years was 0, 2.2, 3.7, and 24.1 per 100,000 for the decades beginning in 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively ( _P_ \\=.003 for incidence trend).

However, traditional continuing medical education (CME) courses cannot meet these educational needs, particularly given the proliferation of knowledge and increasing demands on clinicians’ time and resources. CME courses that previously offered only in-person, face-to-face education must evolve in a learner-centric manner founded on principles of adult learning theory to remain relevant in the current era. In this article, we describe the transition of the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Review for Cardiology Boards and Recertification (CVBR) from a traditional course with only live content to a course integrating live, online, and enduring materials. This evolution has required leveraging technology to maximize learner engagement, offering faculty development to ensure content alignment with learner needs, and strong leadership dedicated to providing learners an unparalleled educational experience. Despite stagnation in growth of the traditional live course, these changes have increased the overall reach of the Mayo Clinic CVBR. Learners engaging with digital content have demonstrated larger increases in knowledge with less educational time commitment. Courses seeking to implement similar changes must develop formal learning objectives focused on learner needs, build an online presence that includes an assessment of learner knowledge, enlist a cohort of dedicated faculty who teach based on principles of adult learning theory, and perpetually refresh educational content based on learner feedback and performance. Following these principles will allow traditional CME courses to thrive despite learners’ resource constraints and alternative means to access information.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ABIM ( American Board of Internal Medicine ), CME ( continuing medical education ), CVBR ( Cardiovascular Review for Cardiology Boards and Recertification ), K2P ( Knowledge to Practice )\n\n【4】Continuing medical education (CME) in the 21st century is evolving rapidly.\n\n【5】Organizational change, leadership, and the transformation of continuing professional development: lessons learned from the American College of Cardiology.\n\n【6】Advances in technology now permit multiple points of learner contact. Busy clinicians can access educational material through a variety of digital recordings and online platforms. In this setting, an explosion of clinical knowledge underscores an ongoing need for continuing education.\n\n【7】These changes have shifted the paradigm of CME. Live courses are no longer necessary to deliver knowledge. In addition, clinicians are less able to leave their practices because of productivity, financial, and administrative expectations, and fewer are willing to spend nonworking time away from their families. Ubiquitous access to information makes live didactic knowledge delivery, a stalwart of traditional continuing medical education, less necessary in the current era. Learners now expect easily accessible activities that facilitate knowledge synthesis and prioritize clinically relevant problem solving.\n\n【8】Finally, evolving proof of competence requirements from medical specialty boards oblige continuous rather than periodic learning.\n\n【9】All these factors have negatively affected attendance at and engagement with traditional live CME meetings.\n\n【10】To meet the needs of learners in this changing environment, CME courses must themselves evolve. Courses can no longer consist of a series of loosely related content experts lecturing to the audience about their own field of expertise. Instead, traditionally didactic courses must shift from a teacher-centered to a student-centered model, design curriculum to meet the specific needs of their learners, and build a team of faculty members who cohesively deliver broad and deep content without gaps or redundancies. This evolution of CME needs to remain grounded in established, evidence-based principles of lifelong continuing education.\n\n【11】This article describes our experience contemporizing a live CME course with a blend of both online and live learning. This evolution has been made possible by 3 important factors: (1) learner engagement through technology, (2) faculty development, and (3) visionary leadership and mentoring for the next generation of educators. These changes have improved learner performance and increased longitudinal involvement with educational materials while still maintaining relevance of the live CME course despite challenges from the external environment.\n\n【12】The Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Review for Cardiology Boards and Recertification Course and Adult Learning Theory\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Review for Cardiology Boards and Recertification (ie, Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Review for Cardiology Boards and Recertification \\[CVBR\\]) began in 1995. The course was initially structured as a traditional CME program, with didactic lectures spread over 5-6 days. Sessions covered the gamut of topics in general and subspecialty cardiology, with a focus on preparing first-time certifiers and recertifiers to pass their American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) Cardiovascular Board Examination. Given its comprehensive content, the course also attracted practicing cardiologists seeking to refresh their knowledge from a comprehensive, evidence-based curriculum. At its peak in 2008, 850 participants attended the live annual course.\n\n【14】As the environment surrounding CME evolved, the course directors recognized the need to grow the course beyond the traditional didactic format. In 2013, they partnered with a third party consulting group, Knowledge to Practice (K2P). K2P provided unique services compared with other third-party CME vendors, such Oakstone’s Practical Reviews or Wolters Kluwer’s Audio Digest, that offer digital content delivery without comprehensive integration into existing live programming. The partnership between the Mayo Clinic CVBR and K2P sought to integrate curriculum design, faculty development, course management, and learner analysis to deliver personalized, competency-based learning. Both K2P and course leaders understood that changes of this magnitude required a strong theoretical basis. Therefore, they founded the evolution of the Mayo Clinic CVBR on established principles of adult learning theory.\n\n【15】The concept of adult learning theory dates to the 1970s, when educational expert Malcolm Knowles outlined his principles of andragogy, also known as _adult learning theory_ .\n\n【16】These principles contrast with pedagogy, which takes a teacher-centered approach to education. The curriculum in andragogy is learner defined rather than teacher defined. Teachers must focus on concepts relevant to a learner’s specific goals. Concepts build on learner experience as opposed to an instructor’s area of expertise, because learners must integrate their prior experiences into new knowledge to feel comfortable changing their behavior. Objective self-assessments shift motivation from extrinsic to intrinsic sources. Therefore, learning in andragogic theory is directly applicable to a learner’s knowledge gaps instead of predefined subjects or tasks.\n\n【17】For more than 25 years, studies have documented that approaches that use principles of adult learning theory improve the effectiveness of CME. For instance, multiple systematic reviews have demonstrated that didactic sessions alone are less effective for improving performance or affecting patient care.\n\n【18】In contrast, workshops and case discussions, which are more interactive, learner-centered, and engaging, demonstrate higher degrees of effectiveness.\n\n【19】Sequenced education (ie, learn-work-learn) can also improve physician performance.\n\n【20】A more recent synthesis of multiple systemic reviews of CME effectiveness reported similar findings: CME improved performance more when it was interactive and focused on outcomes that physicians considered important.\n\n【21】These data have led to a call for CME providers to invoke dissonance between a learner’s actual and perceived knowledge, give learners the opportunity to reflect on desired levels of performance, and facilitate open communication among individuals involved in CME.\n\n【22】Organizations like the American Medical Association and Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education now recognize the need for CME to offer leaner centric content focused on gaps in clinical knowledge.\n\n【23】However, despite recommendations and evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of implementing principles of adult learning theory, traditional CME courses have been slow to adopt such changes.\n\n【24】Organizational change, leadership, and the transformation of continuing professional development: lessons learned from the American College of Cardiology.\n\n【25】By leveraging principles of adult learning theory, Mayo Clinic CVBR leaders sought to differentiate their course in the marketplace and ensure the Mayo Clinic CVBR’s ultimate sustainability. The partnership with K2P offered course leaders the technological tools necessary to apply these adult learning principles to the educational goals of the Mayo Clinic CVBR.\n\n【26】In particular, K2P developed an online learning portal to provide learners consistent and uninterrupted access to educational content. This portal also serves as a data repository that permits CVBR leadership and the K2P staff members to perform ongoing analysis of course metrics before, during, and after the live course.\n\n【27】K2P’s online learning portal currently includes a 250-question formative assessment for learners to complete in the weeks preceding the live course. Each question in the assessment links to a learning objective in the course. We designed questions to assess a balance of knowledge (∼20%), application of knowledge (∼50%), and synthesis of knowledge (∼30%). Learners do not typically complete the pretest in a single setting, which distributes the burden of answering 250 questions. Despite the large number of questions, over the last 3 years, 58% of attendees have completed the formative assessment. The formative assessment helps learners to evaluate their current knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and focus their attention while they attend the live course. When learners complete their formative assessment, the online portal generates a list of personalized learning recommendations. These recommendations highlight sessions in the upcoming course that address a given learner’s knowledge gaps. During the live course, learners use the portal to follow lecture content, ask faculty questions, access supplemental reference material such as guidelines important publications, complete faculty evaluations, and review supplementary online-only presentations that are not part of the live course. The Mayo Clinic CVBR first integrated K2P’s online learning portal as part of the 2014 course. Figure 1 displays a representative screenshot of K2P’s portal.\n\n【28】Figure 1 This image offers a representative screenshot of the online portal developed by Knowledge to Practice and the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Review for Cardiology Boards and Recertification. The portal includes pre-course and post-course assessments. Performance on the pre-course assessment generates a personalized study guide for learners. Learners can use their performance on the post-course assessment to measure their progress as they engage the learning content and seek to fill specific knowledge gaps.\n\n【29】These tools from K2P have allowed the Mayo Clinic CVBR to expand beyond a traditional live course. Digital recordings of the course have been available for purchase as DVDs for several years and remain a popular method through which learners asynchronously engage with the content. However, DVD technology is becoming less accessible, and simple viewing of recorded lectures remains a passive form of learning. Therefore, in 2015, the course began offering an option for online-only registration, giving learners access to content through the online learning portal without attending the live course. These offerings expanded in 2016, when content from the Mayo Clinic CVBR became available as a segmented online course, giving learners access to content in smaller, 5-10-minute segments targeted to specific learning objectives and knowledge gaps. Those participating in this segmented online course do not have the benefit of direct interaction with faculty and peers or dedicated time away from other personal and professional demands that attending the live course offers. Rather, the segmented approach facilitates “learning-on-the-go,” allowing learners to access small pieces of knowledge without requiring them to invest large segments of time. Over the past several years, the Mayo Clinic CVBR has increased its reach by more than 2000 total participants, driven largely through an increase in online access to the course. In contrast, live course participation has stabilized while growth of DVD sales has slowed . Moving forward, these trends will likely accelerate, as resources for live learning become more limited and technology increasingly permit online and digital access to information and medical knowledge.\n\n【30】Figure 2 The number of participants in the traditional live course has remained stagnant and slightly decreased. However, the course has expanded its total participant reach through distribution of enduring materials, particularly online content.\n\n【31】Learner Engagement and Impact of Technology\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【32】A key component underlying the evolution of the Mayo Clinic CVBR has been the focus on learner engagement through technological innovation. This engagement has occurred on several levels, all of which are founded on principles of adult learning theory.\n\n【33】Learner engagement begins several months before the live CVBR course, when registrants receive access to the online pretest. The online pretest drives engagement through multiple mechanisms. For example, literature demonstrates that physicians’ ability to self-evaluate their competence in relation to their peers is notoriously poor.\n\n【34】After completing the pretest, learners receive an objective assessment of their own performance in relation to competency and the performance of their peers. These results identify knowledge gaps and create discordance between actual and perceived competence, which can drive intrinsic motivation and engagement. During the 2017 Mayo Clinic CVBR, learners who completed the pretest had 28% more online portal views than did learners who did not complete the pretest. This result demonstrates that engagement before the course is associated with subsequent engagement during and after the course.\n\n【35】Learner engagement continues during the live course as well. Learners can take and store lecture notes directly in the online portal. They can post online questions that faculty members answer immediately after their lecture. Course directors use analytic data from audience response questions in the lectures to formulate “sprint tests” at the end of each day that reinforce teaching directed toward the audience’s learning gaps for that day’s content. Finally, a large portion of the ABIM’s certification examination in cardiovascular diseases includes interpretation of coronary angiograms, echocardiograms, and electrocardiograms. The online portal provides sample cases in which learners can practice their interpretation of these critical imaging modalities through an interface that simulates the environment of the ABIM Cardiovascular Board Examination.\n\n【36】After the live course, learner engagement continues. Learners retain access to the online portal for 1 year after the live course. This access allows them to review content from the live course lectures along with supplemental online-only content in a variety of formats, including videos, slide sets, transcripts, and audio files. They complete a board-style assessment after the course, which contains the same questions as the pretest. Learners who do not participate in the live course maintain access to digital recordings of the live course and the dedicated online only content. This approach has not adversely affected knowledge gain. In contrast, learners who engage through the complete or segmented online courses have demonstrated 3-fold increases in knowledge from pretest to posttest, with 50% less time dedicated to content engagement . This finding suggests that novel approaches to learner engagement can augment knowledge in a more time- and resource-efficient manner. Although it would be impossible to isolate the influence of education from our course relative to other continuing professional education endeavors in which our attendees participate, future efforts must still attempt to assess the impact of this increased knowledge on practice behaviors and patient-level outcomes.\n\n【37】Figure 3 Data from the Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Review for Cardiology Boards and Recertification demonstrates that, while hours of engagement decreases, knowledge lift can actually increase with a move from traditional live learning formats to online learning.\n\n【38】Figure 4 outlines these tools for optimizing learner engagement that move beyond the traditional model of CME. The tools emphasize longitudinal interaction with content for continuous knowledge and skill development targeted at learner specific practice gaps rather than isolated lectures based on areas of faculty expertise. This learner engagement can occur through blended engagement at a live course and digital interactions outside the bounds of traditional live destination meetings.\n\n【39】Figure 4 Methods of learner engagement that leverage digital technology before, during, and after the live Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Review for Cardiology Boards and Recertification.\n\n【40】Faculty Development\n-------------------\n\n【41】The cardiology community has placed increasing value on the role of educator development\n\n【42】The essential role of educator development: 10 years of the ACC Emerging Faculty Program.\n\n【43】and presentation design in the delivery of educational content. A key aspect in the evolution of the Mayo Clinic CVBR has been faculty development toward a learner centric model. This evolution has involved developing content based on learning objectives, improving presentation design and delivery, and sharing expertise with learners through traditional and novel means.\n\n【44】Achievable learning objectives represent a key element of lifelong learning.\n\n【45】A new educational framework to improve lifelong learning for cardiologists.\n\n【46】They facilitate transitions between lectures, reduce content gaps and redundancies, improve curricular organization, and facilitate knowledge assimilation. Many courses offer learning objectives only as an obligatory response to accreditation requirements; however, learning objectives serve several important roles. First of all, they focus learner attention on key aspects of their curriculum. Perhaps more importantly, learning objectives provide an organizational framework for faculty to structure their content and presentations. To facilitate the shift to a “blended learning environment” and target faculty development efforts, the Mayo Clinic CVBR developed formal learning objectives for each session based on the outline in the ABIM blueprint. This effort increased the total number of learning objectives for the course from 9 in 2013 to more than 250 currently. This focus on learning objectives ensures that faculty members cover all relevant material while avoiding gaps and redundancies.\n\n【47】Faculty development also involves educating faculty about design of energetic and engaging presentations that optimize learning. Through a process of iterative feedback from course directors and course attendees, faculty members gradually improve their presentations. During the live course, both attendees and expert observers evaluate faculty presentations. Evaluations from expert observers emphasize the metrics used for faculty development while evaluations from attendees focus on learner needs and satisfaction. The ratings from both attendees and expert observers correlate well . This demonstrates that the emphasis of faculty development initiatives aligns with learner needs and satisfaction. Finally, course directors remove faculty members from the course who do not engage in multiple attempts at faculty development and improvement.\n\n【48】Figure 5 Learner rating of faculty (y-axis) correlates with expert observer rating of faculty (x-axis), demonstrating that learner needs and expectations align with the metrics course directors use for faculty development and expert observer ratings. Each point represents an individual faculty lecture during the live Mayo Clinic Cardiovascular Review for Cardiology Boards and Recertification course. The y-axis reflects the percentage of attendees providing a favorable score averaged across multiple domains. The x-axis reflects an aggregate of scores from expert observers.\n\n【49】A critical piece of faculty development involves encouraging course faculty members to share their expertise with learners through a variety of channels. After every lecture at the live course, a course director moderates a one-on-one question-and-answer session with each lecturer. These sessions discuss common clinical scenarios plus areas of controversy or ambiguity pertaining to the faculty’s content. Much of the content for these discussions comes from online questions that learners submit through the online learning portal during the live presentation. In addition, the course directors design the agenda such that faculty members are available to attendees for direct conversation and peer-to-peer interactions during breaks in the programming. Finally, course faculty members share their knowledge in the online learning portal by responding to questions learners submit during their lecture. This shared knowledge exchange energizes and engages faculty and drives motivation for future course participation.\n\n【50】Leadership and Mentorship\n-------------------------\n\n【51】This evolution of the Mayo Clinic CVBR would not have been possible without leadership from course directors with a passion for education and an understanding of the larger CME environment. This passion, coupled with a reputation for clinical excellence, provides the guidance and motivation necessary for individual faculty to maximize their teaching skills and raise their own standards of performance. It also offers vision and scope to the course planning team as they pursue continuous curriculum improvement.\n\n【52】A key element of course director leadership has been an emphasis on mentoring and developing the next generation of clinician leaders and educators. Others have recognized the value that CME can have on leadership development, not only for learners but also for those involved in course planning and execution.\n\n【53】The leaders of the Mayo Clinic CVBR have similarly recognized the need to engage future generations. To this end, they identified young faculty members who articulated an interest and proclivity toward cardiovascular education. They offered these faculty opportunities to speak and develop their own educational content. Course directors directly mentored these younger educators in content design and delivery. Course leaders gave them reign to offer new and innovative means of delivering content to course learners. As a consequence, despite relatively limited experience, the younger leaders have scored in the top tier of lecturers in the live course. This dedication and commitment to the career development of others underscores the leadership necessary for transformative change to an existing CME program. It also lays a strong foundation for enduring success.\n\n【54】Recommendations for Others\n--------------------------\n\n【55】How can other courses implement these changes that have transformed the Mayo Clinic CVBR course? Figure 6 offers recommendations for courses seeking to leverage principles of adult learning theory to reinvigorate their programming and more effectively educate an audience of learners in the evolving CME environment. These recommendations encapsulate key steps that the Mayo Clinic CVBR has taken while still remaining broadly applicable across the spectrum of CME courses.\n\n【56】Figure 6 Recommendations for continuing medical education courses seeking to reinvigorate their programming.\n\n【57】The Future of Live CME Programming\n----------------------------------\n\n【58】As CME courses evolve to a mix of live and digital content, clinicians and educators may speculate why live courses continue to exist. If learners can access all content online and achieve greater increases in knowledge with less time commitment , why should educators continue to offer live CME programming? The experience of the Mayo Clinic CVBR demonstrates that live courses remain important in the current CME environment. First, they offer dedicated time away from other professional and personal responsibilities for learners to engage directly with educational content. Second, they drive faculty engagement by offering exciting and invigorating interactions with learners. Finally, live courses provide opportunities for learning outside of the traditional structure of the CME meeting. These opportunities occur through informal conversations with colleagues, peer-to-peer networking, and direct interactions with expert faculty members. Therefore, although digital and online content is an important and almost obligatory complement to live programming, it should not completely supplant live programming for CME content.\n\n【59】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【60】Delivering CME with learner engagement though technology, learner centric faculty development, and visionary leadership, all founded on principles of adult learning theory, can increase the influence and reach of CME programming in the evolving educational environment. Learner engagement occurs through both traditional and digital means. Digital content adds intrinsic value but does not substitute for traditional in-person learning. Courses seeking to implement similar changes must proceed with a firm understanding of adult learning theory. Identifying learners’ knowledge gaps, creating dissonance between actual and perceived knowledge, facilitating open communication between learners and faculty, and using learning objectives and focused scenarios relevant to learners’ daily practice and professional scope are critical for CME courses to evolve. Ultimately, this multifaceted approach can serve as an enduring model for CME in the 21st century.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

We report the case of a healthy 31-year-old man who presented to our emergency department with no clinical evidence of an acute coronary event after intravenous injection of amphetamines. However, he subsequently experienced a non–Q-wave anterior wall myocardial infarction associated with the use of amphetamines.\n\n【1】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【2】CK ( creatine kinase ), ECG ( electrocardiogram )\n\n【3】The amphetamines (amphetamine and methamphetamine) are common drugs of abuse. The primary mechanism of action is the release of dopamine and norepinephrine from the presynaptic nerve terminal, leading to the stimulation of peripheral α- and ×-adrenergic receptors. Complications of amphetamine and methamphetamine use may involve several organ systems; however, the most common cardiovascular effects are tachycardia and hypertension. Myocardial infarction is reported rarely after the use of amphetamines. We report the case of a healthy young man who presented to our emergency department after injection of amphetamines, with no symptoms that suggested an ischemic cardiac event. Subsequently, he experienced a non–Q-wave anterior wall myocardial infarction associated with use of amphetamines.\n\n【4】REPORT OF A CASE\n----------------\n\n【5】A 31-year-old man presented to the emergency department because of generalized discomfort after injecting 4 doses of amphetamine and methamphetamine (crank) over a period of 48 hours. The last injected dose was 8 hours before presentation. The patient denied having chest pain, tightness, or shortness of breath. He admitted regular use of amphetamines by both the nasal and the intravenous routes. He denied using other drugs. A history of tobacco use was the only cardiac risk factor.\n\n【6】At presentation the patient's blood pressure was 145/95 mm Hg, heart rate was 112 beats/min, and respirations were 16/min. He was alert with no distress or diaphoresis. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of venipuncture marks on his arms. Findings on cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained at presentation  demonstrated inverted T waves in leads II, III, aVF, and V <sub>1 </sub> through V <sub>5 </sub> . A second ECG performed within 5 minutes  revealed a new left bundle branch block.\n\n【7】Figure 1 A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained on admission showing inverted T waves in leads II, III, aVF, and V <sub>1 </sub> through V <sub>5 </sub> .\n\n【8】Figure 2 A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained within 5 minutes of the first  showing a new left bundle branch block.\n\n【9】On admission the patient's total creatine kinase (CK) level was 666 U/L (reference ranges shown parenthetically) (22–269 U/L), with a CK-MB of 12.2 ng/mL (<7 ng/ mL). Intravenous nitroglycerin, subcutaneous enoxaparin, oral clopidogrel, and aspirin were instituted, and he was transferred to the intensive care unit, although he remained asymptomatic with no signs of distress. His CK-MB level decreased to 11 ng/mL and 7.4 ng/mL at 2 and 8 hours after admission, respectively. Troponins were not evaluated.\n\n【10】Transthoracic echocardiography performed on the third day of admission demonstrated reduced anterior wall motion with an estimated shortening fraction of 25%. An ECG obtained that same day showed resolution of the bundle branch block and diffuse T-wave inversion in the inferior and anterolateral leads. No Q waves were noted. Cardiac catheterization was not performed because the patient left the hospital prematurely 4 days after admission.\n\n【11】In 2 urine samples collected at the time of presentation and approximately 12 hours later, amphetamines and methamphetamines were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Screening of urine for cocaine metabolites, ethanol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone, opiates, phencyclidine, propoxyphene, and tetrahydrocannabinol was negative.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Amphetamine is a sympathomimetic agent that stimulates catecholamine release, particularly dopamine and norepinephrine, from the presynaptic nerve terminals. Several complications have been associated with acute and chronic use of amphetamines. Tachycardia and hypertension are the most common acute cardiovascular effects. In addition, cardiomyopathy, cardiac dysrhythmias,\n\n【14】cerebral infarction, and intracranial hemorrhage\n\n【15】have been described. Cor pulmonale with pulmonary hypertension, necrotizing vasculitis,\n\n【16】Necrotizing angiitis associated with drug abuse.\n\n【17】and cardiomyopathy have been associated with chronic use.\n\n【18】The occurrence of acute myocardial infarction after amphetamine use has been reported rarely in the literature, a surprising fact given the frequency of amphetamine use.\n\n【19】A summary of the previously published case reports of myocardial infarction associated with amphetamine use is shown in Table 1 . The mean ± SD age was 36±9 years (range, 25–58 years); 9 (82%) of 11 patients were men. All presented with chest pain or epigastric pain, and ECG changes were noted approximately 1.5±1 hour (range, 1–3 hours) after the use of amphetamines. These changes consisted of ST-segment elevation that dynamically evolved to T-wave inversion and/or abnormal Q waves. Patient 6 had ventricular fibrillation on presentation, underwent defibrillation to sinus rhythm, and subsequently had a favorable outcome. Coronary angiography was performed in 10 patients and revealed nonoccluded coronary arteries in 8. In patient 9, an arteriogram showed a filling defect in the left anterior descending coronary artery, and in patient 11, 90% occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was found. All patients had a good outcome except patient 7, who died of cardiogenic shock. Findings on his coronary angiogram were normal.\n\n【20】Table 1 Summary of Previously Reported Cases of Myocardial Infarction Associated With Amphetamine Use\n\n【21】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【22】All patients had a good outcome except patient 7, who died of cardiogenic shock 4 weeks after presentation. Risk factors for coronary heart disease: smoking, patients 3-9; smoking and family history, patients 3, 6, and 9; not reported, patients 1, 2, and 11; and no risk factors, patient 10.

However, there are differences: our patient presented with subendocardial myocardial injury  with no symptoms suggesting an acute coronary insult. Acute ischemic stroke and subarachnoid hemorrhage were ruled out as possible causes of the ECG changes  because the patient had no neurologic symptoms or deficits on presentation or after hospitalization. Therefore, ECG and biochemical cardiac marker testing should be considered in every patient, with or without symptoms to suggest an acute coronary syndrome, presenting to an emergency department after using amphetamines.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

As such, we appreciate having the opportunity to clarify and expound upon our differing opinions.\n\n【1】Kyle and Stanford stated that “although environmental and behavioral factors may influence body fat percentage, it is neither a healthy lifestyle characteristic nor should it be considered as a health behavior.” We agree that body fat percentage is not a health behavior, but we respectfully disagree that body fat percentage cannot be considered a lifestyle characteristic. For this particular analysis, we viewed body fat percentage as an exposure and an important health characteristic rather than an outcome because body fat percentage is associated with morbidity and mortality.\n\n【2】Further, our approach is consistent with that in other studies and that of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\n\n【3】which similarly have reported the 4 healthy lifestyle characteristics to be physical activity, well-balanced diet, nonsmoking status, and normal body weight.\n\n【4】The authors also indicated that “body composition (bone, lean and fat mass) is largely an inherited characteristic” and that “body composition varies significantly by sex, age, race, and ethnicity, which may account for the differences ascertained in this study.” We acknowledge that body composition, and in particular body fat percentage, may be influenced by inherited characteristics, but we also note that there is consistent evidence that modifiable factors (eg, diet and physical activity) influence body fat percentage.\n\n【5】With regard to body composition varying by sex, age, and race/ethnicity, we completely agree and in fact documented this point in Table 1 of our article. Further, these demographic characteristics were adjusted for in our multivariate models.\n\n【6】Kyle and Stanford further stated that a flaw in our study was our “conclusion that a very low percentage of adults have the characteristics of a healthy lifestyle.” In the first paragraph of the “Results” section of our article, we reported the prevalence of participants who had all 4 healthy lifestyle characteristics, as well as the prevalence estimates for those with 0, 1, 2, and 3 healthy lifestyle characteristics. This approach allows the reader to identify the percentage of American adults who have individual and multiple positive health characteristics.\n\n【7】The authors expressed concern about including body fat percentage as a healthy lifestyle characteristic, noting that “many individuals with obesity can and do practice healthy lifestyle behaviors.” We completely agree, and that is why we evaluated the independent associations of body fat percentage with cardiovascular disease biomarkers, as well as the joint associations of body fat percentage and healthy behaviors with the cardiovascular disease biomarkers. These results are presented and discussed in our article.\n\n【8】Kyle and Stanford concluded that “the flaw in this article reflects a widely held and false bias that obesity is exclusively the result of lifestyle behaviors.” We disagree with their interpretation. In fact, our study did not evaluate a direct link between health behaviors and obesity. Rather, we evaluated the independent and combined associations of the 4 health characteristics with cardiovascular disease biomarkers.\n\n【9】Although we appreciate Mr Kyle and Dr Stanford's interest in our article, their letter is not an accurate interpretation of our work or the study's findings.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

She was the eldest of 4 daughters whose father was an archeologist in the Egyptian Education Service. Fearing a possible attack by Turkish troops when World War I began in 1914, her parents sent the children to England to live with their paternal grandmother. After the armistice and the end of World War I in 1918, Dorothy's mother returned to England and taught her children at home. For the next 3 years, she divided her time between England and the Middle East.\n\n【2】Dorothy attended the Sir John Leman School in Beccles, Suffolk, until 1928, when she enrolled at Somerville College, Oxford University, and began her crystallographic studies. She received a BA degree from Somerville College in 1931 and a BSc degree in 1932. She did postgraduate research at Cambridge University from 1932 to 1934, working with English crystallographer and physicist John D. Bernal (1901–1971), who was conducting x-ray analyses of the crystals of steroids. She returned to Somerville College in 1934 as a member of the Department of Mineralogy and Crystallography, where she remained for most of her professional life. In 1937, she earned her PhD degree from Cambridge University with a thesis on the study of steroids.\n\n【3】Shortly after receiving her doctorate, Dorothy married writer and lecturer Thomas I. Hodgkin, who was a cousin of the 1963 Nobel laureate in physiology or medicine Sir Alan Hodgkin (1914–1998) and a descendant of Thomas Hodgkin (1798–1866) for whom Hodgkin disease—cancer of the lymphatic system—is named. After her marriage, Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin continued her work at Oxford University. In 1970, she was appointed chancellor of the University of Bristol, and in 1977, she became a fellow by special election at Wolfson College, Oxford University. She remained active as chancellor (1970–1988) and honorary fellow (from 1988) at the University of Bristol.\n\n【4】In 1942, Hodgkin began her study of penicillin, an antibiotic drug discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming (1881–1955) and later purified by Ernst B. Chain (1906–1979) and Howard W. Florey (1898–1968). By 1949, Hodgkin and her colleagues had determined the molecular structure of penicillin. In 1948, she began x-ray crystallographic analysis of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> , and by 1957, a year after she was appointed a university reader in x-ray crystallography at Oxford University, she had elucidated the molecular structure of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> . Hodgkin's later investigations involved the crystalline structures of calciferol and hemoglobin and the structure of cholesterol iodide.\n\n【5】Besides the Nobel Prize, Hodgkin received the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1976, the British Order of Merit in 1965, and many other awards and honors, both national and international.\n\n【6】Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin died in Shipston-on-Stour, England, on July 29, 1994, at the age of 84 years.

Increasing distance from the equator is associated with increased risk of several cancers at a population level. However, one of the major limitations of ecological studies is referred to as the _ecological fallacy_ , which is the error of making inferences at an individual level on the basis of aggregate population level data. It is entirely possible that a disease association found by comparing populations is absent, or even in the opposite direction, when individual level data are examined. Individuals in the population who develop cancer may not be those with low vitamin D status. In the case of ecological studies involving international cancer registries, many low-income countries are close to the equator and their cancer registries may be limited by the fact that many cancers are undiagnosed and underreported, resulting in a high likelihood of an ascertainment bias.\n\n【1】Ecological studies are useful for generating hypotheses, but experimental studies and individual level data are necessary to ascertain causality.\n\n【2】The association of reduced sunlight exposure at higher latitudes with increased cancer risk does not indicate that low vitamin D status causes increased cancer risk. Many confounding environmental and population variables are associated with both latitude and vitamin D exposure that can affect disease risk. For example, income, industrialization, temperature, water consumption, meat and fat intake, outdoor activity, obesity, and affective disorders are all associated with latitude and could be hypothesized to affect cancer risk apart from vitamin D status. Although vitamin D deficiency may be identified as a major risk factor for certain types of cancer or other diseases, experimental studies are needed to confirm this, in part because RCTs have failed to demonstrate the benefit of vitamin D supplementation for the prevention of breast and colon cancer.\n\n【3】Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and the risk of breast cancer.\n\n【4】Calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and the risk of colorectal cancer.\n\n【5】A large 5-year RCT of vitamin D supplementation currently under way may clarify the nonskeletal benefits of vitamin D, but the duration may be too short to establish its effect in long-latency diseases like cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Although characterized as a “safe” treatment strategy, in our opinion, it might not be optimal for all patients with CAD and a history of cancer.\n\n【7】Many of the clinical risk factors for cancer such as diabetes mellitus, smoking, and a chronic inflammatory state are also risk factors for coronary artery restenosis and thrombosis after stenting. The current generation of DES reduces the risk of restenosis and stent thrombosis as compared with bare-metal stents.\n\n【8】RAVEL Study Group  \nRandomized study with the sirolimus-coated Bx velocity balloon-expandable stent in the treatment of patients with de novo native coronary artery lesions: a randomized comparison of a sirolimus-eluting stent with a standard stent for coronary revascularization.\n\n【9】It was previously felt that the biggest disadvantage of DESs was the requirement of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for at least 12 months after stent placement. This interpretation of anticoagulant therapy resulted from the experience with first-generation DESs, in which it was inferred that DES stent failure was more likely because of inhibition of neointimal formation resulting in incomplete endothelialization.\n\n【10】However, data on the current generation of DES calls this interpretation of the pathophysiology into question.\n\n【11】A prespecified analysis from the Zatarolimus-Eluting Endeavour Sprint Stent in Uncertain DES Candidates (ZEUS) trial found that patients with high bleeding risk and those receiving stents that slowly eluted zotarolimus (an immunosuppressant) had a lower rate of stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization compared with those receiving bare-metal stents, despite shorter duration of DAPT (15-60 days). Furthermore, rates of bleeding events did not differ between the 2 stent groups.\n\n【12】Is bare-metal stent implantation still justifiable in high bleeding risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention? A pre-specified analysis from the ZEUS trial.\n\n【13】Additional evidence is inferred in studies looking at patients with thoracic malignancies: Mediastinal radiotherapy decreases mortality and malignancy recurrence but is associated with a 7-fold increased risk of CAD. Surgical revascularization is often necessary but is associated with high perioperative complications due to unsuitability of the left internal mammary artery following irradiation. Bare-metal stents, in this population, have been associated with very high rates of in-stent restenosis. In contrast, the newer DESs have shown no difference in the rate of in-stent restenosis between irradiated and nonirradiated patients,\n\n【14】Outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention with stents in patients treated with thoracic external beam radiation for cancer.\n\n【15】which makes them preferable in this population.\n\n【16】Although cancer patients may be considered at high risk for bleeding, this risk is not equivalent in all patients with a history of cancer. Cardiovascular disease in patients with cancer is complex, and treatment needs to be individualized. There is evidence to suggest that refraining from the use of DES in this rapidly expanding cohort can lead to higher major cardiovascular events, which can thwart the effectiveness of advancements in both fields. Given more current data demonstrating improved efficacy with DESs and short-duration DAPT, without an increase in bleeding risk, perhaps it is time to rethink our strategy in cancer patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Alehashemi and Ward examined whether such predisposition occurs in ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Using US Medicare data from 1999 to 2015, these investigators identified three cohorts of beneficiaries: one with AS, another with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, a disease with immunopathogenetic features similar to AS and a control for chronic inflammation), and a third which comprised an unaffected control with neither AS nor IBD (unaffected control). Beneficiaries in these cohorts were 65 years of age at the time of enrollment in 1999, and those treated with TNF inhibitors during this period were excluded so as to avoid the confounding effects of such therapy; mean duration of follow-up in years was 9.9 (AS), 9.3 (IBD), and 8.0 (unaffected control). The findings of Alehashemi and Ward demonstrate that the standardized incidence ratio was increased for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma in AS compared with unaffected controls, whereas the risks for such diseases were comparable in the AS and IBD groups. As their study did not include analyses on younger patients, Alehashemi and Ward undertook a systematic review of published studies that explore the association between AS and hematologic malignancies because such published studies largely involved young and middle-aged patients. Such a review of 21 studies revealed little or no association of AS with hematologic malignancies; 2 cohort studies reported an increased occurrence of multiple myeloma with AS, with the mean age reported for one of these studies being 53.5 years. Among the conclusions of this study by Alehashemi and Ward are that such hematologic malignancies tend to occur in elderly patients with AS, but generally do not occur in young and middle-aged patients; clinicians caring for elderly patients with AS thus need to be cognizant of this risk for these hematologic malignancies and that such risks do not necessarily reflect the use of TNF inhibitors _per se_ . Finally, such risks for hematologic malignancies in elderly patients with AS are reminiscent of what occurs in IBD - such congruence of findings in AS and IBD exemplifies the promalignant effects of immunosenescence in synergy with chronic proinflammatory conditions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Polymerase chain reaction-based tests are performed on respiratory secretions collected with nasopharyngeal swabs every 14 days, starting 14 days before donation and 14 days after donation, with a maximum interval of 14 days between tests.\n\n【37】At Mayo Clinic, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed using a laboratory-developed real-time PCR, as described in detail by Rodino et al.\n\n【38】Evaluation of saline, phosphate-buffered saline, and minimum essential medium as potential alternatives to viral transport media for SARS-CoV-2 testing.\n\n【39】Serologic testing was performed using either the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Roche Diagnostics, Inc. Rotkreuz, Switzerland) or the VITROS Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. Raritan, New Jersey), both of which are US FDA Emergency-Use Authorized tests. At the University of Minnesota, PCR-based tests are performed using the Cepheid Xpert SARS-CoV-2 assay (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, California) and the DiaSorin Molecular Simplexa COVID-19 Direct assay system (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Italy). Donors are required to maintain a temperature log and complete a new questionnaire on COVID-19 risk assessment every time they make a stool donation and at every screening interval.\n\n【40】According to institutional protocols, vetted via infection prevention and control and with guidance from the national gastroenterology societies, all recipients undergoing procedures were screened for COVID-19 symptoms and exposure. A colonoscopy was not considered as a respiratory aerosol-generating procedure. Patients requiring moderate sedation with midazolam and fentanyl were not deemed to need COVID-19 swabs ahead of time. Patients who were undergoing upper endoscopy, along with a colonoscopy, for any reason, or who were undergoing the procedure under anesthesia-assisted sedation, were required to undergo COVID-19 screening before the procedure.\n\n【41】Patients with recurrent CDI diagnosed with PCR for CDI or enzyme immunoassay for the toxin production were included. The majority of patients were diagnosed with a PCR assay. In patients with multiple causes of diarrhea, such as those with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), response to antibiotic treatment was used as a marker of a diagnosis of CDI. Complete response to antibiotics was defined as return to baseline bowel pattern, and partial response was defined as an improvement in bowel pattern but not completely returning back to baseline. In patients with response to antibiotics, the decision was made to proceed with FMT after a detailed discussion of risks, benefits, and alternatives.\n\n【42】Patients who underwent FMT at Mayo Clinic from May 26, 2020, to September 30, 2020, were included in this retrospective analysis. After donor screening, donor stool is processed in an anaerobic chamber. Donor stool is diluted 1:5 (weight by volume) in a diluent (90% normal saline and 10% glycerol) and then filtered. Donor stool is kept frozen at –80 °C (–112 °F). Symptomatic patients need to undergo a brief period of therapy with antibiotics to manage active and acute symptoms of CDI. Stool recipients then undergo a bowel preparation for colonoscopy, and discontinue antibiotics 24 hours before FMT. On the day of the procedure, the stool is thawed to room temperature. For FMT, 1 dose is used from 1 donor and is 50 grams of donor stool in 250 cc of diluent, which is implanted into the recipient colon in the cecum by means of a colonoscopy. No additional antibiotics are recommended after FMT.\n\n【43】After undergoing FMT, patients were actively followed at 1 week for improvement in symptoms and development of new symptoms and thereafter instructed to contact in case of symptoms. For development of COVID-19, patients were followed at 1 week actively and subsequently through a review of the electronic medical record. Patients were followed up for at least 4 weeks for this study.\n\n【44】The Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved the study to follow up outcomes after FMT. Data were collected by means of review of the electronic medical record, donor screening logs, and patient follow-up. Data were entered into JMP version 14.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) for statistical analyses. Demographic and clinical variables were summarized using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables are reported as mean (standard deviation) or median (range), and categorical variables are reported as proportions.\n\n【45】Results\n-------\n\n【46】### Mayo Clinic Donor Experience\n\n【47】Two standard donors have been in the donor program during this pandemic. In addition to the usual donor screening, COVID-19 testing has been performed every 2 weeks for donors. Symptom assessment for COVID-19 is performed at every testing time point and at every stool donation. The first donor (long-term stool donor) has been in the COVID-19 assessment program since May 7, 2020, and continues to date. The second donor was added to the program on August 4, 2020. Donor assessment results for COVID-19 have been negative by nasopharyngeal PCR and serology through 14 rounds of testing for the first donor and 8 rounds of testing for the second donor. No donors have been excluded because of COVID-19 infection to date. The donated stool samples are not tested for presence of SARS-CoV-2, as there is no validated stool test available for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【48】### University of Minnesota Donor Experience\n\n【49】Three active donors continued to participate in the program through this period, and 3 people were recruited as potential candidates after negative screening on comprehensive questionnaires and physical examinations. Two of these 6 people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. One active donor tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 14 days after production was completed. The donor was asymptomatic. The material was not released out of quarantine for clinical use. One newly recruited person reported exposure to COVID-19 and was immediately suspended from the program. The donor stool was not used for FMT. Later, this person tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 outside of the donor program. This person never donated stool for production. The donor material generated from this screening at the University of Minnesota has not been used so far because of the existing stockpile manufactured before December 1, 2019. The donated stool samples have not been tested so far for presence of SARS-CoV-2 because of lack of access to a validated stool test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【50】### FMT Recipients\n\n【51】From May 26, 2020, to September 30, 2020, 57 patients have undergone FMT for rCDI at Mayo Clinic. The median age was 63.9 years (range: 19.9 to 93.2), and 35 (61.4%) were women. The median number of CDI episodes before FMT was 3 (range: 2 to 7). All patients received antibiotics for CDI (48 on vancomycin and 9 on fidaxomicin) until 24 hours before FMT. Of these patients, 10 had underlying IBD. Of these patients, 52 (91.2%) had risk factors for CDI (most commonly, antibiotic exposure in 48 patients); all had symptoms of CDI with recurrent episodes. Overall, 55 (96.5%) patients had a complete (n=33) or partial (n=22) response to antibiotics for CDI, and 2 patients (1 had underlying IBD) underwent FMT for CDI with no response to antibiotics.\n\n【52】Overall, 53 (93%) underwent FMT via colonoscopy and 4 (7%) via combined upper endoscopy and lower endoscopic procedure (1 pouchoscopy, 1 flexible sigmoidoscopy in a patient with partial colectomy, 2 with a colonoscopy). Before FMT, 22 (38.5%) patients underwent testing for COVID-19 via serology, and 29 (50.8%) patients underwent testing for COVID-19 via nasopharyngeal swab PCR. These tests were done in accordance with institutional guidance, in which patients undergoing upper endoscopic procedures or procedures under anesthesia-assisted sedation underwent preprocedural testing. None of the patients tested positive for COVID-19 via PCR, and 1 patient tested positive for serology (did not have known symptomatic COVID-19) before FMT.\n\n【53】### Outcomes\n\n【54】During follow up, 19 patients developed recurrent symptoms suggestive of CDI and were tested for CDI; 3 tested positive. One patient had primary FMT failure (recurrent symptoms with no additional risk-factor exposure) and was managed with vancomycin, followed by repeat FMT. Two patients had recurrent CDI after additional systemic antibiotic exposure and were managed with a standard course of oral vancomycin, with resolution of their symptoms. An alternate cause of diarrhea was identified in the remaining patients (primarily postinfection irritable bowel syndrome or active IBD), and these patients responded to appropriate therapies. There were no differences in efficacy seen in patients based on presence of underlying IBD.\n\n【55】Of those who underwent FMT, 1 patient developed respiratory symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 and tested negative via a nasopharyngeal swab PCR. Eleven additional patients underwent COVID-19 testing for further elective procedures or hospitalizations, and all tested negative. No COVID-19 transmission was seen. Fortunately, there has been no COVID-19 diagnosed in the health care workers and technicians involved in the FMT procedure.\n\n【56】Discussion\n----------\n\n【57】Microbiome restoration therapies, such as FMT, are the cornerstone for management of rCDI, with high rates of success, and have been deemed cost effective for CDI.\n\n【58】In this study, we demonstrate a robust screening program for SARS-CoV-2 from 2 academic centers, enabling the study to continue FMT during this pandemic. Donors who test positive or get exposed to SARS-CoV-2 are excluded from being stool donors. In addition, we demonstrate ongoing success of FMT for CDI and, more importantly, establish safety and efficacy of FMT in management of CDI with meticulously screening donors for COVID-19. Patients were able to undergo FMT safely, and none developed COVID-19 after FMT.\n\n【59】Performing FMT during a pandemic such as COVID-19 has several challenges.\n\n【60】Because of concerns about patient safety and limitations of health care resources, elective procedures are usually delayed or canceled.\n\n【61】Fair allocation of scarce medical resources in the time of Covid-19.\n\n【62】As most patients with rCDI have resolution of symptoms on antibiotics and can be maintained on low-dose oral vancomycin (eg, 125 mg once a day or every other day) or fidaxomicin, long term, with resolution of symptoms, FMT can be considered an elective procedure.\n\n【63】However, this strategy can be challenging owing to the cumulative cost and rare instances of side effects from oral vancomycin. This strategy raises even more concerns in the pediatric population, in which the long-term effects of antibiotics can affect the developing microbiome or may have other detrimental effects on health. In addition, long-term use of vancomycin may risk development of resistance in _C. difficile_ and other organisms.\n\n【64】Increasing antibiotic resistance in Clostridioides difficile: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【65】Update on antimicrobial resistance in Clostridium difficile: resistance mechanisms and antimicrobial susceptibility testing.\n\n【66】Clinically, at times it is challenging to differentiate rCDI from other causes, such as postinfection irritable bowel syndrome. In previous studies, patients with resolved CDI and postinfection irritable bowel syndrome have been administered FMT or similar microbiome-based therapies when these therapies were not needed.\n\n【67】Effect of fecal microbiota transplantation on recurrence in multiply recurrent Clostridium difficile infection: a randomized trial.\n\n【68】If there is primary nonresponse to oral vancomycin, one should look for alternative causes of diarrhea. For true primary nonresponse to vancomycin therapy (which is rare), fidaxomicin can be used, or one can resort to FMT (if available) to treat active CDI.\n\n【69】During these unprecedented times, FMT may not be readily available. Novel regimens of fidaxomicin have been shown to have a low rate of recurrence.\n\n【70】Extended-pulsed fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for Clostridium difficile infection in patients 60 years and older (EXTEND): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3b/4 trial.\n\n【71】An example of such a regimen is the fidaxomicin extended protocol, in which fidaxomicin is used as 200 mg twice a day for 5 days and then every other day from day 7 through day 25. Other alternatives, such as intravenous bezlotoxumab, are available and have shown reduced rates of recurrence compared with placebo.\n\n【72】Bezlotoxumab for prevention of recurrent clostridium difficile infection in patients at increased risk for recurrence.\n\n【73】Patients who respond to oral vancomycin can be maintained on the lowest effective dose of oral vancomycin for control of symptoms until FMT is available. Finally, there are available clinical trials for microbiome restoration therapies that can be considered.\n\n【74】The availability of resources to test for COVID-19 is variable. In the United States, some centers are still struggling with adequate access to testing, and the turnaround time for symptomatic patients is longer than is practicable or clinically helpful. Access to testing is currently prioritized for symptomatic patients and patients undergoing procedures in which knowledge of infection would have an impact on the patient or health care team. Stool donors are generally considered to be of lower priority for access to testing, and these donors need repeat testing. Both Mayo Clinic in Rochester and University of Minnesota have had a standard donor program and, over the years, have maintained standard donors. Donor screening by history and for infectious agents was carried out per existing protocol. At one center, adding regular testing for SAR-CoV-2 led to attrition of 1 standard donor, whereas the other donor agreed to continue in the program to undergo symptom screening every other week and at every donation and undergo every-other-week testing for COVID-19 with antibody testing and nasopharyngeal swab for PCR testing. A new donor was recruited after starting this program to keep up with the demands of the practice. Serology testing is performed to evaluate for seroconversion over time in a known donor and enhance the ability to detect asymptomatic infection, given that PCR screening performed every other week may fail to identify asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 infection. Stool samples are kept under embargo until follow-up testing is performed. As stool is kept under embargo, and bookend testing is performed for COVID-19—including serology—and donors are screened with symptoms at every donation in between, a testing frequency of every other week seems reasonable. Two donors at 1 of the centers have tested positive; their material has not been used, and they have been excluded from being stool donors. There will continue to be logistical implications if the asymptomatic donor tests positive for COVID-19 in terms of isolation practices, testing, and information from family members and other close contacts, and the psychological effects of a positive COVID-19 test on an otherwise asymptomatic patient. A similar donor-screening protocol has been proposed by a multicenter group.\n\n【75】Reorganisation of faecal microbiota transplant services during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【76】Moving forward, assays for detection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in stool with a PCR-based assay would help with the logistics of FMT. If such a test is available, individual or batched stool samples from 1 donor can be checked with a stool assay. This would help with expanding the availability of FMT during this pandemic, along with donor retention. Availability of stool testing could replace serology and nasopharyngeal swabs with continuation of donor-symptom assessment. At our centers, like many others during a pandemic, the clinical and research virology laboratory has been diligently working on developing validated assays to diagnose patients. The clinical load of testing for COVID-19 for symptomatic patients during a pandemic is very high, and the majority of the testing capacity is being used to diagnose local patients and referred patient samples. These logistics have delayed the validation and implementation of a stool assay. We are hopeful that a stool assay will be available in the near future. It is very interesting to speculate that the transmissibility of the infection from a PCR-positive tested stool sample would be variable based on the viral load in the stool sample. It is still not clear if SARS-CoV-2 seen in the stool samples is living or transmissible. A cycle threshold value correlating with viral transmissibility has not yet been established, and, conceivably, a very low cycle threshold could correlate with transmissibility. It seems unlikely that FMT would lead to SARS-CoV-2 transmission and nasopharyngeal screening and serology appear to be useful until stool tests are available.\n\n【77】Medical centers that do not have access or resources for maintaining frozen stool may consider recruiting and screening individual donors, such as family members. Recommended donor infectious screening along with COVID-19 screening can be performed in this setting within 48 hours of FMT procedure. It would be pertinent in this situation for the potential donor to self-quarantine to avoid COVID-19 exposure between testing and stool donation. Another option would be to screen a close household contact, such as a spouse, considering that members of a family living in close proximity would share similar COVID-19 status.\n\n【78】The majority of FMT done in the United States is dependent on OpenBiome, which has recently paused its operations.\n\n【79】Therefore, there is an unmet clinical need that has led to increased consideration of donor-directed FMT and clinical trials of microbiome restoration therapies. There have been positive phase 3 topline results, and scientific publications are awaited.\n\n【80】Until an FDA-approved product becomes widely available, it is important for us to have protocols and procedures in place to perform FMT safely.\n\n【81】The donor data presented in this study are from 2 centers, the experience for FMT is at a single center, and there is a rather short-term follow-up, but they provide insight and guidance as to how to perform FMT during the pandemic. The lack of availability of a validated stool assay for SARS-CoV-2 remains a limitation.\n\n【82】Conclusions and Recommendations\n-------------------------------\n\n【83】The optimal strategy to treat rCDI starts with appropriate identification of cases, including an accurate diagnosis of rCDI based on symptoms, testing, and response to antibiotic treatment. Fecal microbiota transplantation can be performed safely for rCDI during the COVID-19 pandemic, using our described donor screening and testing strategy that mitigates the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Detailed informed consent outlining risks and benefits of FMT vs alternatives, such as continued low-dose vancomycin, or immune-enhancing strategies, such as bezlotoxumab, is prudent. Donor screening for COVID-19 by history, serology, and nasopharyngeal PCR should be performed every 2 weeks, with stool donations in the interim. Processed and frozen stool should be embargoed until follow-up testing results are negative. Development and validation of a sensitive stool assay for SARS-CoV-2 would mitigate this risk further.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The risk of developing cancer has been estimated to be approximately 1 in 250 patient-years of observation; however, there appear to be subsets of patients at much higher risk. Risk stratification has previously been determined by histological identification of dysplasia. Several new biomarkers are being tested to help clinicians better determine the risk of cancer development. Although none of these biomarkers has been proven in a prospective study to predict the onset of cancer, they have been correlated with cancer development. Most of these are factors that have been associated with cancer development in other organs. These include assessment of cell proliferation, expression of cyclooxygenase 2, growth factors and oncogenes, secretory factors, cell cycle proteins, adhesion molecules, and aneuploidy and other genetic abnormalities. In addition to their role as potential cancer biomarkers, these factors have increasingly been reported as surrogate markers to monitor the effectiveness of conservative treatments for Barrett esophagus. In this article, biological markers are reviewed for their relevance in Barrett esophagus. Although most biological markers need to be evaluated further and, for most, prospective follow-up studies are lacking, at present abnormal ploidy status, _P16_ and _P53_ gene abnormalities, or allelic losses are the most extensively documented.\n\n【1】COX-2 ( cyclooxygenase 2 ), EGF ( epidermal growth factor ), EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ), ODC ( ornithine decarboxylase ), TGF-α ( transforming growth factor α )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The effect of BMI, comorbidity, and baseline eGFR on disease-free and overall survival was studied using Cox regression controlling for pathologic stage, nodal status, and metastasis.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Over a 10-year interval, median BMI increased from 27 (interquartile range \\[IQR\\], 24-31) to 28 (IQR, 25-31; _P_ \\=.004), and median baseline eGFR decreased from 70 (IQR, 58-80) to 63 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> (IQR, 57-78; _P_ <.001).

We repeated the analysis for patients aged 18 to 70 years, and this association persisted ( _P_ <.001).

Overall, 54.2% of women (3123 of 5766) and 57.0% of men (8672 of 15,213) received BCPR in public locations ( _P_ <.001), and 46.5% of women (11,263 of 24,216) and 44.0% of men (17,390 of 39,539) received BCPR in residential locations ( _P_ <.001). In the multivariable logistic regression analyses, there was no significant difference between the sexes in terms of who received BCPR in public locations (adjusted odds ratio \\[AOR\\], 0.99; 95% CI, 0.92-1.06), and women had a higher likelihood of receiving BCPR in residential locations (AOR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.04-1.13). In public locations, women aged 18 to 64 years were less likely to receive BCPR (AOR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.74-0.99), and when witnessed by a non–family member, women were less likely to receive BCPR regardless of age group.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The reasons for this sex-based disparity should be better understood to facilitate public health interventions.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AED ( automated external defibrillator ), AOR ( adjusted odds ratio ), BCPR ( bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ), CPC ( cerebral performance category ), CPR ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation ), EMS ( emergency medical services ), FDMA ( Fire and Disaster Management Agency ), OHCA ( out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ), OR ( odds ratio ), PEA ( pulseless electrical activity ), VF ( ventricular fibrillation ), VT ( pulseless ventricular tachycardia )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

This work showed that the genetic system of the bacteriophage is organized similar to that of higher organisms. These 3 biochemists discovered that nucleic acid is responsible for genetic continuity during phage reproduction, a finding that provided evidence that nucleic acid is the genetic material of cells. The biochemists sharing the prize were Alfred Day Hershey (1908-1997), Salvador Luria (1912-1991), and Max Delbrück (1906-1981). Hershey worked at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, NY, and Luria at Columbia University in New York City; Delbrück performed his research at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. Working independently, all 3 scientists described the mechanism by which living cells are infected with viruses.\n\n【1】Alfred Hershey was born on December 4, 1908, in Owosso, Mich (about 30 miles northeast of Lansing). He attended public elementary and secondary schools in Owosso and in Lansing, where his father was a stockkeeper in an automobile plant. In 1930, Hershey received a BS degree in chemistry from Michigan State College (now Michigan State University), from which he also received his PhD degree in bacteriology and chemistry in 1934.\n\n【2】After Hershey received his doctorate, he joined the faculty at Washington University in St Louis, Mo, and remained there until 1950. In 1950, he became associated with the Department of Genetics (now the Genetic Research Unit) at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, NY, where he conducted the research that won him a share of the Nobel Prize. In 1962, he became director of the Genetic Research Unit. He retired in 1974.\n\n【3】Hershey's early research was on the chemistry of _Brucella_ bacteria and in the area of immunology. He also worked on the development of vaccines for various childhood diseases. While he was at Washington University, he became interested in bacteriophages (viruses that attack and lyse bacteria).\n\n【4】The three 1969 Nobel laureates in medicine or physiology began exchanging information on phage research in the early 1940s. In 1945, Hershey and Luria (working independently) demonstrated the occurrence of spontaneous mutations in both the bacteriophage and the host. In 1946, Hershey and Delbrück (working independently) discovered the occurrence of genetic recombination in phages. During this time, a loosely knit group of scientists dedicated to solving the mystery of viral reproduction (the “phage group”) began sharing information.\n\n【5】In 1952, Hershey and colleagues showed that during viral infection, the viral nucleic acid (and not the protein associated with it) enters the cell—that is, the genetic material is the nucleic acid, not the protein.\n\n【6】Hershey died on May 22, 1997, in Syosset, Long Island, NY. Besides receiving the Nobel Prize, he was awarded many honors from universities and learned societies. In 1995, he was honored on a stamp issued by Guyana.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Her cough, which had gradually worsened, progressed to dyspnea after several feet of walking. She denied fever, chills, sick contacts, chest pain, palpitations, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. She had taken levofloxacin for a presumed upper respiratory tract infection with no relief and was receiving oral immunosuppressive therapy with 1 mg/d of prednisone and 25 mg of cyclosporine twice daily. Her other medications included losartan, metoprolol, mesalamine, and alendronate. Although she had no history of cardiac problems, examination revealed a mildly elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) and trace peripheral edema.\n\n【1】*   1.\n\n【2】    **_Which one of the following is the most likely etiology for the patient's symptoms of cough and dyspnea?_**\n\n【3】    *   a.\n\n【4】        _Asthma_\n\n【5】    *   b.\n\n【6】        _Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)_\n\n【7】    *   c.\n\n【8】        _Chronic bronchitis_\n\n【9】    *   d.\n\n【10】        _Heart failure_\n\n【11】    *   e.\n\n【12】        _Fungal pulmonary infection_\n\n【13】Asthma can present in a 68-year-old patient with cough; however, it is uncommon and would not be associated with an elevated JVP. This patient also had no wheezing, which is the hallmark finding of asthma. GERD, a common cause of cough, is due to chemical irritation of the airways, is usually associated with symptoms of reflux, and does not cause dyspnea. It is unlikely in this patient who had no reflux and progressive dyspnea. Chronic bronchitis would typically be associated with a cough productive of colored sputum and would usually respond to antibiotics. This patient's increased JVP, progressive dyspnea, and failure to respond to antibiotics is most consistent with heart failure. Fungal infection can occur in immunocompromised patients, but our patient had no fever, and this diagnosis would not explain the elevated JVP.\n\n【14】The patient's dyspnea worsened, and she presented to the emergency department, where she was found to have decreased breath sounds over the right base. Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin of 12.7 g/dL, a leukocyte count of 6.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, and a creatinine level of 1.6 mg/dL (at baseline). Chest radiography demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions, worse on the right side, as well as pericardial calcification that was unchanged from that seen on chest radiography 5 years previously. Thoracentesis was performed, with removal of 800 mL of amber pleural fluid. Analysis of the pleural fluid yielded the following results: pH, 7.9; Gram stain, negative; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 66 U/L; and total protein, 2.8 mg/dL. Her serum total protein was 7.0 g/dL (reference range, 6.3-7.9 g/dL), and her serum LDH was 180 U/L (reference range, 122-222 U/L). Her liver function was stable, and she had no ascites on examination.\n\n【15】*   2.\n\n【16】    **_On the basis of the pleural fluid analysis, which one of the following is the most likely etiology for the patient's bilateral pleural effusions?_**\n\n【17】    *   a.\n\n【18】        _Uncomplicated parapneumonic effusion_\n\n【19】    *   b.\n\n【20】        _Complicated parapneumonic effusion_\n\n【21】    *   c.\n\n【22】        _Malignancy_\n\n【23】    *   d.\n\n【24】        _Hepatohydrothorax_\n\n【25】    *   e.\n\n【26】        _Heart failure_\n\n【27】It is diagnostically helpful to classify pleural effusions as either transudates or exudates on the basis of Light criteria.\n\n【28】An exudate is defined by Light criteria as a pleural total protein/serum total protein ratio greater than 0.5 or a pleural LDH/serum LDH ratio greater than 0.6. The patient's pleural effusion is a transudate because the protein and LDH concentrations in the pleural fluid are very low compared with the serum values. Her pleural protein/serum protein ratio was 0.4, and her pleural LDH/serum LDH ratio was 0.37.\n\n【29】Both uncomplicated and complicated parapneumonic effusions occur in the setting of lower lung infection and present as exudates. The effusion is “complicated” if the pH is less than 7.2 or if the Gram stain is positive. Because this patient's pleural fluid was transudative, parapneumonic effusions are unlikely to be responsible for her effusions. Our patient had no infiltrates, fever, leukocytosis, or other findings of infection. Pleural effusions associated with malignancy are usually exudates as well. Our patient had no weight loss or other constitutional symptoms that would suggest malignancy. Hepatohydrothorax is a right-sided transudative pleural effusion caused by refractory ascites. It is due to increased intraperitoneal pressure from massive ascites and is difficult to treat. This patient has a history of liver transplant due to PSC, but she had no ascites on examination and had normal hepatic synthetic function. Heart failure is most often transudative and is the most likely explanation for this effusion.\n\n【30】Additional laboratory testing revealed a brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 1067 pg/mL (reference range, <114 pg/mL), which further supports heart failure as a cause of her chronic cough and recurrent pleural effusions. Laboratory testing, chest radiography, and pleural fluid analysis are helpful in establishing a diagnosis of heart failure, but it is ultimately a clinical diagnosis. Our patient had trace peripheral edema but denied orthopnea or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, which made heart failure probable but not certain at this point.\n\n【31】*   3.\n\n【32】    **_Which one of the following is the most appropriate next test in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient?_**\n\n【33】    *   a.\n\n【34】        _Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)_\n\n【35】    *   b.\n\n【36】        _Transesophageal echocardiography_\n\n【37】    *   c.\n\n【38】        _Coronary artery catheterization_\n\n【39】    *   d.\n\n【40】        _Right heart catheterization_\n\n【41】    *   e.\n\n【42】        _Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging_\n\n【43】Transthoracic echocardiography is the most appropriate next test in the evaluation of obvious or suspected heart failure. It assesses both systolic and diastolic function and allows a good evaluation of heart valves. Transesophageal echocardiography can also assess systolic function and has better resolution of the left atrium and mitral valve. However, it is invasive and requires sedation, making noninvasive TTE the best next test in this case. Transesophageal echocardiography would be preferred to TTE in certain clinical situations, such as evaluating vegetations in suspected infective endocarditis or ruling out left atrial thrombus before electrical cardioversion, but such scenarios are not relevant to the current case.\n\n【44】Ischemic cardiomyopathy is a common cause of heart failure, and coronary artery catheterization is the criterion standard for detection of coronary artery disease. Although coronary artery catheterization is often required in evaluating for heart failure, a noninvasive TTE should be performed first. If left ventricular systolic function is reduced (ie, decreased ejection fraction) and ischemic cardiomyopathy is suspected, then it would be reasonable to next conduct a functional cardiac study to detect hibernating myocardium and consider coronary angiography. To proceed directly to coronary artery catheterization at this point would be premature. Right heart catheterization is useful for exact measurement of pulmonary artery pressures. It would be used to confirm or quantify pulmonary hypertension or constrictive pericarditis but would never be done without first obtaining a noninvasive TTE. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is a new technology that provides excellent morphologic assessment of the myocardium and pericardium and, indeed, is considered to be the criterion standard for measurements of pericardial thickness. However, respiratory variations in cardiac hemodynamics, the hallmark finding of constrictive physiology, may not be as readily appreciated as on Doppler echocardiography.\n\n【45】The patient underwent TTE, which showed a left ventricular ejection fraction of 62%, with normal left and right ventricular size and function. Because echocardiography revealed normal left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, it was not certain that heart failure was the cause of her symptoms despite her pleural effusions and elevated BNP level. She was treated symptomatically with a plan for a follow-up TTE in 3 months if her symptoms persisted.\n\n【46】The patient's cough and shortness of breath persisted, and she presented to the emergency department several weeks later with worsening cough and dyspnea. On examination, she had 3+ peripheral edema, with pleural effusions approximately one-third the way up from the lung base. Thoracentesis again showed transudative pleural effusion, and her BNP level was still elevated at 820 pg/mL. Follow-up echocardiography was performed at this point.\n\n【47】With the aid of a respirometer, echocardiography revealed reciprocal respiratory ventricular interdependence. Specifically, blood flow velocity varied during mitral inflow with respiration, and blood flow in the hepatic veins reversed during diastole. The cardiology service was consulted and interpreted these new findings of altered mitral and tricuspid inflow velocities with respiration as classic findings for constrictive pericarditis.\n\n【48】*   4.\n\n【49】    **_Which one of the following most likely led to the pericardial calcification that resulted in this patient's condition?_**\n\n【50】    *   a.\n\n【51】        _Prior radiation therapy_\n\n【52】    *   b.\n\n【53】        _Autoimmunity_\n\n【54】    *   c.\n\n【55】        _Idiopathic or viral etiology_\n\n【56】    *   d.\n\n【57】        _Tuberculosis_\n\n【58】    *   e.\n\n【59】        _Medications_\n\n【60】Prior radiation therapy is a known cause of constrictive pericarditis, but our patient had no such history. Connective tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, have been reported to cause 3% to 7% of constrictive pericarditis, but our patient had no history of such disease.\n\n【61】Her history of PSC may have played a role, but no formal reports of this specific association have been made. The most common cause of constrictive pericarditis is idiopathic or viral, and that was the presumed etiology in this case. Although common in developing countries, tuberculosis pericarditis is rare in the United States. It is frequently associated with pericardial calcification and is a consideration in this patient, especially given her immunosuppression. Findings on a serum mycobacterium QuantiFERON test for tuberculosis were negative. Medicationinduced constrictive pericarditis is uncommon but has been reported with procainamide and hydralazine.\n\n【62】Once a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis was confirmed for our patient, we formulated a treatment plan.\n\n【63】*   5.\n\n【64】    **_Which one of the following is the best management plan for this patient's condition?_**\n\n【65】    *   a.\n\n【66】        _a. Medical management with outpatient diuresis: 40 mg/d of furosemide orally_\n\n【67】    *   b.\n\n【68】        _b. Medical management with inpatient diuresis: furosemide drip at 10 mg/h titrated for a goal diuresis of 1.5 L/d_\n\n【69】    *   c.\n\n【70】        _c. Surgical management: proceed directly to median sternotomy and complete pericardiectomy_\n\n【71】    *   d.\n\n【72】        _d. Surgical management: coronary angiography followed by median sternotomy and complete pericardiectomy_\n\n【73】    *   e.\n\n【74】        _e. Referral to a hospic_ e\n\n【75】No good medical treatment exists for constrictive pericarditis. Whether the patient's heart failure is managed on an inpatient or outpatient basis, diuresis alone will not improve her symptoms and is not adequate therapy. Surgical pericardiectomy is curative in constrictive pericarditis and is the appropriate management in this case. However, surgery should not be performed without coronary angiography for several reasons. First, angiography can determine whether coronary artery atherosclerosis is present. If high-risk lesions (eg, left main disease or multivessel disease) are detected, coronary artery bypass grafting can be done at the same time as pericardiectomy with little added morbidity. The detection of coronary artery disease would also help assess whether coronary ischemia was contributing to the patient's heart failure. Pericardiectomy is the definitive treatment for constrictive pericarditis and should be performed promptly, but not until coronary angiography has been completed. Hospice referral would not be indicated in this case because the patient's heart failure is likely reversible with pericardiectomy.\n\n【76】Coronary angiography was performed, revealing minimal coronary artery disease, with 20% to 40% stenosis of the major vessels. No interventions were made. On the basis of these findings, we consulted the cardiothoracic surgery service, which recommended proceeding to pericardiectomy. During the operation, extensive plate-like calcification of the pericardium, between 0.4 and 1 cm thick, was observed. The pericardium was successfully removed, and the patient's postoperative course was uneventful. At her 6-month cardiology follow-up visit, her cough and pleural effusions had completely resolved, and she had normal exercise tolerance. Follow-up echocardiography showed normal cardiac function without constrictive physiology.\n\n【77】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【78】This case is a good illustration of how challenging the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis can be. Diagnosis is often delayed, as it was in our patient. Key factors in the delay of her diagnosis were the long-time presence of pericardial calcification and the initial lack of peripheral edema. Findings on TTE can appear normal in patients with constrictive pericarditis, especially early on in its course, as occurred in this case. The etiology of constrictive pericarditis was studied in a series of 163 patients. The most common cause was idiopathic (46%), followed by prior cardiac surgery (37%), radiation treatment (9%), and miscellaneous (8%).\n\n【79】Constrictive pericarditis: etiology and cause-specific survival after pericardiectomy.\n\n【80】Patients present with signs of fluid overload, such as peripheral edema or ascites, or with diminished cardiac output, such as dyspnea on exertion. In one series, 67% of patients presented with heart failure symptoms.\n\n【81】Constrictive pericarditis in the modern era: evolving clinical spectrum and impact on outcome after pericardiectomy.\n\n【82】Our patient's presentation was unusual because she had pleural effusions without substantial peripheral edema. The Kussmaul sign (lack of inspiratory decline and/or inspiratory rise in jugular pressure) may be present in patients with constrictive pericarditis but may also be confused with large “v” waves, as seen in patients with severe tricuspid valvular disease or right-sided heart failure. In a recent series of 135 patients with constrictive pericarditis, only 21% of patients had the Kussmaul sign.\n\n【83】Constrictive pericarditis in the modern era: evolving clinical spectrum and impact on outcome after pericardiectomy.\n\n【84】Our patient did not have the Kussmaul sign.\n\n【85】The distinction between constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy is critical because the treatment approaches and associated outcomes are highly disparate. Surgical pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis is curative, whereas patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy are managed medically and have a relatively poor prognosis. No single test can completely distinguish constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy, but echocardiography is the most informative.\n\n【86】Respiratory variation in ventricular filling and central venous flow velocities is seen in constrictive pericarditis.\n\n【87】Diagnostic role of Doppler echocardiography in constrictive pericarditis.\n\n【88】Indeed, this patient's constrictive pericarditis was not diagnosed until she underwent echocardiography with a respirometer that showed ventricular interdependence, reciprocal changes in the atrioventricular valve Doppler signals (early passive mitral inflow velocity: increased during expiration, decreased during inspiration, and converse for tricuspid inflow), and end-diastolic hepatic vein flow reversal during expiration.\n\n【89】Tissue Doppler echocardiography is also useful in making the diagnosis. In restrictive cardiomyopathy, the myocardial mitral annular velocity is diminutive, whereas in constrictive pericarditis it is high normal or increased. The ratio of early passive filling velocity to early diastolic mitral annular velocity is known as the E/e' ratio, a measurement of left ventricular filling pressures. This ratio is increased significantly in restrictive cardiomyopathy but is normal in constriction.\n\n【90】Large series have demonstrated the efficacy of pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis, but early deaths occur from low-output syndrome regardless of surgical technique.\n\n【91】Constrictive pericarditis in the modern era: evolving clinical spectrum and impact on outcome after pericardiectomy.\n\n【92】One recent study showed that patients with abnormal left ventricular contractility and relaxation properties assessed by preoperative cardiac catheterization had a higher mortality rate.\n\n【93】Impact of left ventricular function on immediate and long-term outcomes after pericardiectomy in constrictive pericarditis.\n\n【94】Patients who have constrictive pericarditis due to radiation therapy also have poorer long-term outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Strategies to combat the proinflammatory state, using multiple investigational compounds, are in the pipeline as potential treatment modalities for COVID-19.\n\n【2】In France, the Cohort Multiple Randomized Controlled Trials Open-label of Immune Modulatory Drugs and Other Treatments in COVID-19 Patients (CORIMUNO-19) platform was designed and set up as a series of multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of immunomodulators and other treatments of COVID-19. As part of this platform, one open-label RCT, CORIMUNO-TOCI, found that the use of tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, was associated with a lower ventilation requirement (invasive or noninvasive) or death at day 14. However, the final report of this RCT has not yet been released for peer review.\n\n【3】As mentioned in our review article, there are several other RCTs that are currently being conducted to assess interleukin-6 inhibition in COVID-19.\n\n【4】An artificial intelligence platform, BenevolentAI, identified baricitinib, a Janus kinase inhibitor, as another potential option to battle the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19.\n\n【5】Baricitinib as potential treatment for 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease.\n\n【6】COVID-19: combining antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatments.\n\n【7】In addition to its anti-inflammatory properties, baricitinib can have antiviral properties by preventing the adaptor-associated protein kinase 1 and cyclin G-associated kinase–mediated endocytosis of the virus. Baricitinib will be tested as one of the drugs in the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT). As we emphasized in our review article, the appropriate timing for the use of these anti-inflammatory agents will be critical. It is important to reiterate that the host inflammatory response plays a vital role in the immune defense against the infection, and curbing the inflammatory state may decrease the response mounted by the host’s immune system.\n\n【8】Since the online publication of our review, the investigational RNA-dependent RNA inhibitor remdesivir has been granted emergency use authorization by US Food and Drug Administration on the basis of preliminary data obtained from the ACTT. The press release of this trial stated a 31% faster time to recovery in the remdesivir arm compared with placebo (11 days vs 15 days, respectively; _P_ <.001).\n\n【9】The scientific community is eagerly awaiting the release of the clinical trial results. Interestingly, another study, conducted in China, did not find any clinical benefit with remdesivir use. There was no difference in 28-day mortality between the 2 groups, and the degree of viral decline was similar. However, this study was underpowered to detect significant differences because of low accrual as a result of the decline in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection rates.\n\n【10】Remdesivir in adults with severe COVID-19: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial.\n\n【11】The author highlighted the recent reports of prolonged detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in some individuals. However, the presence of viral nucleic acid in respiratory samples can be a reflection of nonviable genetic material. The viability of the virus material in these patients has not been conclusively established. Nonetheless, we agree with his comment that there is an urgent need for the development of antiviral therapies and vaccines. Indeed, there are many parallel and collaborative efforts to advance this goal, at an extraordinary pace, and some using novel RNA interference- and plasmid DNA–based approaches. In the meantime, multicenter trials such as World Health Organization’s Solidarity Trial, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases ACTT, and European CORIMUNO-19 cohort as well as DISCOVERY trial strive to generate evidence to determine the optimal treatment of COVID-19.\n\n【12】The ongoing climate change, disruption of natural ecosystems, and human migration guarantee that we remain at risk of pandemics in the foreseeable future. Knowledge generated now will not only help us fight the current pandemic, but our lessons will also prepare us to prevent and maybe better coordinate our response for the future pandemics.

We calculated BF by using the Jackson-Pollock equation and LMI using (1 − BF) × BMI. The population was divided according to the sex-adjusted BMI classification, sex-adjusted LMI classification, and sex-adjusted BF tertiles. The population was analyzed by using multivariate analysis for total mortality over a mean follow-up duration of 3.1 years by using the National Death Index, adjusting for left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular mass index, age, sex, and relative wall thickness.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In the entire population, higher BMI was narrowly associated (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 0.99; _P_ <.001) with lower mortality. The higher LMI group was clearly protective (HR, 0.71; _P_ <.001), whereas BF tertile was associated with lower mortality only if no adjustment was made for LMI (HR, 0.87; _P_ <.001 without LMI; HR, 0.97; _P=_ .23 with LMI). In the lean patients, low BMI was clearly associated with higher mortality (HR, 0.92; _P_ <.001) and lower BF tertile was associated with lower mortality only if no adjustment was made for LMI (HR, 0.80; _P_ <.001 without LMI; HR, 1.01; _P=_ .83 with LMI). The underweight patients stratified by BF seemed to have an increased mortality (HR, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.56-2.34) that was independent of LMI. However, in obese patients, both BMI (HR, 1.03; _P_ <.001) and BF (HR, 1.18; _P_ \\=.003) were associated with higher mortality, even after adjusting for LMI, which remained protective (HR, 0.57; _P_ <.001) independently of BF.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Body composition could explain the inverse J shape of the mortality curve noted with increasing BMI. Body fat seems to be protective in this cohort only if no adjustment was made for LMI, although being underweight stratified by BF seems to be an independent risk factor. Lean mass index seems to remain protective in obese patients even when BMI is not.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BF ( body fat ), BMI ( body mass index ), CHD ( coronary heart disease ), HF ( heart failure ), HR ( hazard ratio ), LMI ( lean mass index ), LVEF ( left ventricular ejection fraction ), LVMI ( left ventricular mass index ), RWT ( relative wall thickness )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Whereas 2-year survival for patients with glioblastoma remained stagnant for decades at a dismal 10%, it nearly tripled to 27% with the advent of temozolomide (TMZ) and increased almost 5-fold for patients whose tumors harbor a specific genetic alteration (O <sup>6 </sup> \\-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene \\[ _MGMT_ \\] promoter methylation) in a pivotal study just over 10 years ago.\n\n【11】European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Brain Tumor and Radiotherapy Groups; National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group  \nRadiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma.\n\n【12】MGMT gene silencing and benefit from temozolomide in glioblastoma.\n\n【13】The publication of that pivotal study a decade ago was the beginning of one advance after another, each documenting improvements in survival for patients with gliomas. Through advances in the identification of molecular signatures found in these tumors, new directions have been identified that are guiding treatment options in the field. Such new directions include the key role of genetic alterations that will inevitably replace the standard diagnostic procedures based on microscopy (histology/grade). These genetic alterations help to better match specific treatment modalities with a tumor based on its biologic features. This article will highlight several key advances in chemotherapy that have occurred over the past decade that, in turn, direct us toward an even brighter future for our patients.\n\n【14】Chemotherapeutic Extension of Survival in Patients With Glioblastoma: TMZ and the Identification of _MGMT_ as a Molecular Marker\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】As the field of neuro-oncology was approaching the end of the 20th century, we had amassed a wealth of information about the molecular biology of glioma cells, which, in turn, identified many potential targets for therapeutics. Figure 1 illustrates the signal transduction pathways that drive glioma growth, with several principal components: the growth factor receptor (GFR) at the cell surface functioning as a “docking station” for growth signals; secondary messenger systems within the cells that are activated by GFRs; the DNA as a common convergence point for many signal transduction pathways to activate expression of cancer-associated genes (oncogenes); and the protein products of those oncogenes that then define the malignant phenotype (cell cycle progression/mitosis, angiogenesis, tumor invasiveness).\n\n【16】Each component of this molecular diagram is an ongoing or potential target for therapeutics. Despite numerous drugs developed to inhibit the new molecular targets of signal transduction, in the end it was targeting DNA—the archetypal target in most cancers—that led to the first chemotherapy breakthrough with the advent of TMZ.\n\n【17】European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Brain Tumor and Radiotherapy Groups; National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group  \nRadiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma.\n\n【18】MGMT gene silencing and benefit from temozolomide in glioblastoma.\n\n【19】Figure 1 Signal transduction pathways in glioma.

For decades, the dogma held that surgery and radiotherapy (RT)\n\n【21】were the only 2 therapeutic modalities that improved survival of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), with only 10% of patients surviving 2 years. A pivotal European/Canadian study by Stupp et al\n\n【22】European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Brain Tumor and Radiotherapy Groups; National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group  \nRadiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide for glioblastoma.\n\n【23】described the addition of a well-tolerated oral chemotherapeutic agent, TMZ, which alkylates DNA (adds methyl group—hence the term _alkylation_ —to guanine residue of DNA) (since termed the _Stupp protocol_ ). The Stupp protocol includes TMZ at 75 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> on days 1 through 42 with concomitant RT, followed by TMZ on days 1 through 5 of 28 for 6 consecutive months as adjuvant therapy at a dose of 150 to 200 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> . This regimen led to an improvement in 2-year survival to 27%. Furthermore, the presence of a specific alteration—methylation of the _MGMT_ gene promoter—improved 2-year survival to 47%, a 5-fold increase compared with RT alone.\n\n【24】MGMT gene silencing and benefit from temozolomide in glioblastoma.\n\n【25】The _MGMT_ gene product repairs the DNA modification caused by alkylators such as TMZ, and therefore, silencing of the _MGMT_ gene by promoter methylation is thought to confer increased sensitivity to TMZ. As a result of these 2 back-to-back publications in 2005, RT combined with TMZ became the long-awaited new standard of care in newly diagnosed glioblastoma and _MGMT_ the key molecular marker in our field.\n\n【26】Table 1 Impact of Temozolomide and _MGMT_ Promoter Methylation on Survival in Patients With Glioblastoma\n\n| Treatment modality | 2-Year survival |\n| --- | --- |\n| RT only | 10% |\n| RT + TMZ | 27% |\n| RT + TMZ + _MGMT_ promoter methylation | 47% |\n\n【28】_MGMT_ \\= O <sup>6 </sup> \\-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene; RT = radiotherapy; TMZ = temozolomide.\n\n【29】Tailoring the Stupp Regimen for the Elderly Patient Population\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】_MGMT_ promoter methylation thus became an important prognostic marker in neuro-oncology. Given that the benefit of TMZ is most apparent when this gene alteration is present, _MGMT_ methylation may also be a marker that guides therapy choices. The role of _MGMT_ in helping to guide therapy was highlighted in a series of reports pertaining to optimization of treatment for the elderly population with high-grade glioma.\n\n【31】Table 2 summarizes the evolution of treatment—in particular, the trimming of the Stupp regimen—for the elderly patient population. The French study\n\n【32】Association of French-Speaking Neuro-Oncologists  \nRadiotherapy for glioblastoma in the elderly.\n\n【33】found that a standard 6-week course of RT (6000 cGy over 6 weeks) improves survival compared with palliative care alone. However, the standard RT course was poorly tolerated by many patients in the study, leading to a decrease in Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score, increased utilization of corticosteroids, and decreased quality of life, raising the question as to whether the standard RT course is suitable for all elderly patients. Particular concern is given to those with poor KPS score because these patients are at greatest risk for poor tolerance of RT and may be unable to complete the full course of therapy. The Canadian study\n\n【34】Abbreviated course of radiation therapy in older patients with glioblastoma multiforme: a prospective randomized clinical trial.\n\n【35】addressed this concern and documented that RT could be abbreviated to 3 weeks without compromising survival and that this regimen was, as anticipated, better tolerated. Nonetheless, the question remained as to whether RT could be omitted altogether and the patient be treated with the well-tolerated oral TMZ alone. In this regard, the subsequent German\n\n【36】NOA-08 Study Group of Neuro-oncology Working Group (NOA) of German Cancer Society  \nTemozolomide chemotherapy alone versus radiotherapy alone for malignant astrocytoma in the elderly: the NOA-08 randomised, phase 3 trial.\n\n【37】and Scandinavian\n\n【38】Nordic Clinical Brain Tumour Study Group (NCBTSG)  \nTemozolomide versus standard 6-week radiotherapy versus hypofractionated radiotherapy in patients older than 60 years with glioblastoma: the Nordic randomised, phase 3 trial.\n\n【39】studies found that for patients with _MGMT_ methylation, treatment with TMZ alone was not inferior (or perhaps was even superior) to RT. These aforementioned studies evaluated specific RT schedules (without chemotherapy) or TMZ alone but did not evaluate the question of combining RT with chemotherapy. That question was addressed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)/National Cancer Information Center study\n\n【40】A phase III randomized controlled trial of short-course radiotherapy with or without concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide in elderly patients with glioblastoma (CCTG CE.6, EORTC 26062-22061, TROG 08.02, NCT00482677) \\[abstract\\].\n\n【41】comparing abbreviated (3 weeks) RT used alone or in combination with TMZ, the latter being a “trimmed down” version of the original Stupp protocol. In a recent report, the study results were positive, with the addition of TMZ to RT improving overall survival, especially in patients with _MGMT_ methylation.\n\n【42】Table 2 Evolution of Treatment Options for Elderly Patients\n\n| Study | Question/study/results |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【44】EORTC = European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer; _MGMT_ \\= O <sup>6 </sup> \\-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene; NCIC = National Cancer Information Center; NOA = Neuro-oncology Working Group; OS = overall survival; RT = radiotherapy; TMZ = temozolomide.\n\n【45】There is no doubt that these recent reports reflect tremendous advances in our treatment options for the elderly patient population. But the results also raise important questions. For one, what age group should be defined as elderly? The patients in the aforementioned studies ranged from 60 years or older to 70 years or older. Also, what matters more—chronological age or biological age? Should all patients over a certain age be barred from a 6-week standard course of RT (which would bar them from many clinical studies)? Despite the questions raised, these recent advances arm the clinician with choices. For example, for the patient whose neurologic/performance status is somewhat compromised, a 3-week course of RT (with TMZ) is a viable option because it is likely to be better tolerated than 6 weeks of RT. For the patient whose KPS score is quite poor but treatment is still desired, then perhaps TMZ alone could be considered (if the tumor is _MGMT_ methylated). Such diversity of choices was not previously available to this growing patient population in which adverse effects of treatment are all the more apparent than in younger age groups. Undoubtedly, incorporation of other genetic markers  will further advance our understanding and tailoring of therapy for not only elderly patients but patients of all ages.\n\n【46】Can We Further Improve Outcome by Adding Another Treatment to the RT-TMZ Combination?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Although the demonstration of extended survival with TMZ for patients with GBM was a tremendously welcome and long-awaited advance, we need to continue to build on this foundation. Many of the extracellular and intracellular targets illustrated in Figure 1 have been subjected to drug targeting. To date, no one drug has been found to add another layer of benefit to the RT-TMZ regimen for newly diagnosed GBM.\n\n【48】In the current model for clinical trials for newly diagnosed GBM, promising agents are first tested in the setting of recurrent glioma  and if there is evidence of activity (for example, prolongation of progression-free survival), the drug is brought to the frontline setting for evaluation in newly diagnosed patients. In that regard, the monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab) that inhibits angiogenesis by binding and neutralizing a tumor-derived paracrine angiogenic protein (vascular endothelial growth factor \\[VEGF\\]) produced impressive results in the recurrent glioma setting.\n\n【49】Bevacizumab plus irinotecan in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.\n\n【50】Bevacizumab alone and in combination with irinotecan in recurrent glioblastoma.\n\n【51】However, when tested in conjunction with RT-TMZ in newly diagnosed GBM in 2 large prospective, randomized studies,\n\n【52】A randomized trial of bevacizumab for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.\n\n【53】Bevacizumab plus radiotherapy-temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.\n\n【54】no benefit was seen compared with placebo added to RT-TMZ. Although these results were disappointing, some degree of optimism remains regarding bevacizumab for this patient population. Molecular analysis of patient tumor samples by microarray-based gene expression profile analysis has revealed that patients whose tumor harbors the proneural expression profile live longer when treated with bevacizumab.\n\n【55】Patients with proneural glioblastoma may derive overall survival benefit from the addition of bevacizumab to first-line radiotherapy and temozolomide: retrospective analysis of the AVAglio trial.\n\n【56】Such findings underscore the importance of incorporating molecular markers into clinical trials that provide additional layers of data stratified by genetic alterations.\n\n【57】While the search continues for drugs or antibodies to improve outcome for patients with newly diagnosed GBM, exciting results have emerged by way of a medical device. Described as a fourth modality of therapy (the 3 conventional modalities being surgery, RT, and chemotherapy), the tumor-treating field (TTF) device was found in an open-label prospective randomized study to increase survival, boosting the 2-year survival from 29% with RT-TMZ alone to 43% when the TTF device was added in the adjuvant treatment phase in patients with a good performance status.\n\n【58】Maintenance therapy with tumor-treating fields plus temozolomide vs temozolomide alone for glioblastoma: a randomized clinical trial.\n\n【59】The TTF-based device consists of a battery/power source that is connected to adhesive pads containing arrays that generate a high-frequency alternating electric field. The proposed mechanism of action is that such a device applied to the patient’s shaved head interferes with the formation of microtubules required to separate DNA during mitosis. During mitosis, tubulin monomers must undergo polymerization to form microtubules, but in the presence of the TTF generated by the device, this polymerization is disrupted as the intrinsic electric dipole of each tubulin monomer leads it to align in the direction of the device-generated electric field, leading to disruption of glioma cell mitosis. After its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in late 2015, the TTF device modality is finding its place in our armamentarium of glioma therapeutics.\n\n【60】When Up-front Therapies Fail: Treatment Options for Recurrent Glioma\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【61】The aforementioned advances of TMZ added to RT (Stupp regimen), tailoring of RT-TMZ to the elderly population, and abrogation of mitosis by electric fields have changed the landscape of glioma therapy. Nonetheless, for the great majority of patients with GBM, the tumor does ultimately break through frontline therapies. To date, bevacizumab remains the only treatment that has gained widespread acceptance for nonsurgical treatment of recurrent glioma. There are 2 important points about the journey leading to bevacizumab approval for recurrent glioma.\n\n【62】First, innumerable clinical studies evaluating drugs that target GFRs and secondary messenger system components  have failed dismally. These failures are due to a myriad of reasons, including poor delivery and redundancy in the signaling system. Delivery of many of these drugs, which are often hydrophilic/polar in nature, is severely impeded by the blood-brain barrier, and hence, effective drug concentrations often cannot be attained.\n\n【63】Intratumoral concentrations of imatinib after oral administration in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.\n\n【64】Moreover, even if a drug were able to traverse the blood-brain barrier and neutralize its intended GFR target, the tumor cell may not be affected because other GFRs that are also overexpressed continue to drive tumor growth.\n\n【65】Coactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases affects the response of tumor cells to targeted therapies.\n\n【66】Second, given the poor experience in targeting specific signaling pathway components in glioma, would better results be attained by targeting an aspect of tumor biology that is not unique to gliomas but shared across most, if not all, tumor types? Such an extrapolation led to the evaluation of angiogenesis inhibitors in patients with brain tumors, and studies before evaluation in glioma reported exciting results of bevacizumab in many cancer types. Initial studies in glioma\n\n【67】Bevacizumab plus irinotecan in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.\n\n【68】Phase II trial of bevacizumab and irinotecan in recurrent malignant glioma.\n\n【69】were generalized from the colorectal carcinoma literature, in which bevacizumab (antibody that neutralizes the principal angiogenic protein, VEGF) was used in combination with irinotecan. These earlier promising reports then led to a randomized study comparing bevacizumab combined with irinotecan vs bevacizumab alone that revealed no significant advantage conferred by irinotecan, hence leading to FDA approval in 2009 of single-agent bevacizumab for treatment of recurrent high-grade glioma.\n\n【70】Bevacizumab alone and in combination with irinotecan in recurrent glioblastoma.\n\n【71】Despite the widespread use of bevacizumab since FDA approval, there still exists no conclusive data that this therapy improves overall survival. In fact, the median time to resistance to bevacizumab is a disappointing 4 months, with tumor cells escaping bevacizumab control due to (1) utilization of alternate angiogenic pathways (eg, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, mesenchymal stem cells) that are independent of bevacizumab’s target VEGF\n\n【72】Lessons from anti-vascular endothelial growth factor and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor trials in patients with glioblastoma.\n\n【73】and (2) induction of an evasive phenotype in which tumor cells may take on a more infiltrative/metastatic behavior after exposure to bevacizumab.\n\n【74】Tumor invasion after treatment of glioblastoma with bevacizumab: radiographic and pathologic correlation in humans and mice.\n\n【75】As a result, many trials have tested other drugs—often the very same small molecule inhibitors that were already known to be ineffective as single agents—and to date, all studies have had negative results. The addition of lomustine, a nitrosourea, to bevacizumab in a phase 2 study increased progression-free and overall survival in the classic subtype of patients with recurrent glioblastoma,\n\n【76】Single-agent bevacizumab or lomustine versus a combination of bevacizumab plus lomustine in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (BELOB trial): a randomised controlled phase 2 trial.\n\n【77】and this regimen may show promise in phase 3 studies. Increased understanding of the various angiogenic pathways (especially those not involving VEGF) in glioma growth will then hopefully lead to ways by which we can overcome resistance to current angiogenesis inhibitors.\n\n【78】Learning From the Past: Older Studies Bearing Fruit Decades Later\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【79】Thus far, we have reviewed promising clinical trial data in high-grade gliomas arising from studies initiated in the early 2000s or later. Similarly, results from studies initiated in the 1990s that have only recently matured have made a huge impact in the care of patients with low- and intermediate-grade gliomas. Two groups asked the same question: Does chemotherapy add benefit to RT in patients with intermediate- and low-grade glioma? Both studies yielded positive results with a doubling of life expectancy and, moreover, led to further underscoring the importance of molecular markers in treatment planning.\n\n【80】### Intermediate-Grade Glioma\n\n【81】The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 9402 study, hence named because it was initiated in 1994, evaluated the 3-drug regimen consisting of procarbazine, lomustine \\[CCNU\\], and vincristine (PCV) in addition to RT in the treatment of patients with World Health Organization (WHO) grade III/anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors. When initial results were reported in 2006,\n\n【82】Phase III trial of chemotherapy plus radiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone for pure and mixed anaplastic oligodendroglioma: Intergroup Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Trial 9402.\n\n【83】concurrently with results of a similar study done in Europe by the EORTC,\n\n【84】Adjuvant procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine improves progression-free survival but not overall survival in newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas: a randomized European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer phase III trial.\n\n【85】both studies found no difference between the treatment arms. When the data matured 6 years later, the survival curves split specifically for the patients whose tumors harbored a deletion of chromosome segments 1p and 19q (termed _1p/19q codeletion_ ). Both studies reported essentially the same findings—the addition of chemotherapy doubled survival from approximately 8 years (RT alone) to 15 years or longer.\n\n【86】Phase III trial of chemoradiotherapy for anaplastic oligodendroglioma: long-term results of RTOG 9402.\n\n【87】Adjuvant procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine chemotherapy in newly diagnosed anaplastic oligodendroglioma: long-term follow-up of EORTC Brain Tumor Group study 26951.\n\n【88】In the absence of 1p/19q codeletion, the presence of a mutation in the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene ( _IDH_ ) was also predictive of survival benefit from PCV therapy.\n\n【89】Benefit from procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine in oligodendroglial tumors is associated with mutation of IDH.\n\n【90】Both genetic alterations (1p/19q codeletion and _IDH_ mutations) were not identified until well after these studies had been initiated, but thanks to the foresight of the RTOG and EORTC study teams, archival tumor tissue from study participants could be located and assessed for these key genetic determinants, which yielded practice-altering results guided by molecular variables.\n\n【91】### Low-Grade Glioma\n\n【92】As indicated by its name, the RTOG 9802 study was initiated in 1998. This study, like the one described previously, evaluated the role of adding PCV chemotherapy to RT but this time in the context of low-grade (WHO grade II) gliomas of both oligodendroglial and astrocytic cell types.\n\n【93】Radiation plus procarbazine, CCNU, and vincristine in low-grade glioma.\n\n【94】For patients in the higher-risk category (any patient >40 years of age or any patient regardless of age who had residual tumor after biopsy/surgery), chemotherapy improved overall survival. But similar to the study with grade III oligodendrogliomas, the oligodendroglial tumors as well as tumors harboring the _IDH_ mutation derived the most apparent benefit from the chemotherapy. The relatively small number of patients whose tumors were available for 1p/19q analysis made it difficult to determine if that gene alteration was predictive of chemotherapy benefit.\n\n【95】As such, both the intermediate- and low-grade glioma studies discussed herein determined that the oligodendroglial cell type as well as the presence of _IDH_ mutation portends a better outcome with chemotherapy. The experience of these pivotal studies of low- and intermediate-grade glioma is somewhat ironic in that advances in tumor genetics led to a rekindled interest in a chemotherapy regimen (PCV) that was believed to be a thing of the past. Controversy remains regarding whether PCV is superior to TMZ in this setting. Perhaps there is no such thing as “old drugs,” but rather simply drugs that have yet to be matched to the appropriate patient population.\n\n【96】A Decade of Advances in Genetics and Chemotherapy: Is Immuno-Oncology the Next Frontier?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【97】The past decade has indeed been eventful, marked by a number of important clinical advances. We can improve survival in low-, intermediate-, and high-grade gliomas by adding chemotherapy to RT, and now for all 3 conditions, the combined therapy is the new standard of care. In all 3 grades of glioma, specific genetic alterations serve as not only prognostic but also predictive markers because they identify which patient population would best benefit from chemotherapy. However, although the overall life expectancy has increased substantially, treatment resistance is too often an occurrence, largely stemming from 2 major hindrances to therapy—tumor heterogeneity and barriers to drug delivery.\n\n【98】Although a schematic of a single tumor cell as depicted in Figure 1 may be accurate for that one individual tumor cell, the reality is that a patient’s tumor mass is composed of millions of cells, each cell with its potential to diverge and evolve its own molecular alterations, thereby generating extensive intratumoral heterogeneity. In such a system in which, for example, EGFRvIII alteration can be seen in one area of the tumor but not in another, the possible permutations of this and other genetic alterations from one cell to another in a large tumor mass can be endless.\n\n【99】Mutational landscape and clonal architecture in grade II and III gliomas.\n\n【100】Herein lies the challenge of finding a curative treatment—how to treat such an incredible diversity of tumor cells with just 1, 2, or 3 drugs. The future may lie in immunologic therapies.\n\n【101】Figure 2 and Table 3 illustrate the therapeutic challenges as well as potential solutions presented by immunologically based therapies. The tumor mass  presents the challenge of the tremendous heterogeneity of cells, each cell harboring antigens distinct from other cells within the mass. These tumor antigens are processed by the dendritic cells, which present the antigens to T cells , thereby converting naive T cells to their activated forms. There are several checkpoints in this pathway whose function is to dampen T-cell activation in order to avoid an overzealous immune reaction that could lead to autoimmune conditions. Such immunosuppressive checkpoints exist at the point of antigen presentation  and in the tumor microenvironment  and are amenable to therapy with checkpoint inhibitors .\n\n【102】Figure 2 Therapeutic challenges and potential solutions presented by immunologically based therapies. A = tumor mass; B = tumor antigens are processed by the dendritic cells, which present the antigens to T cells, thereby converting naive T cells to their activated forms; C = activated T cells are capable of entering the central nervous system via expression of specific cell surface molecules; D = tumor microenvironment; EGFR = epidermal growth factor receptor; red triangles = blood-brain barrier.\n\n【103】Table 3 Immunotherapeutic Approaches to Address Challenges in Brain Tumor Treatment in Immuno-oncological Therapies\n\n| Challenge to treatment | Possible solution/approach |\n| --- | --- |\n| Tumor heterogeneityIn “A” on Figure 2 , heterogeneity is illustrated by different colored cells (each cell representing a distinct set of molecular alterations and antigens) | Dendritic cell vaccineAntigen-presenting cells or dendritic cells process and present innumerable tumor antigens to T cells to generate activated antitumor T cellsResected tumor serves as a rich source of numerous tumor antigens to be targeted by T cells, thereby addressing the issue of tumor heterogeneity |\n| Antigen presentation by dendritic cells  is dampened by cell-cell interactions between dendritic cells and T cells.

In regard to chemotherapy, our field has gone from having no clear role for chemotherapy in the treatment of glioma to chemotherapy being able to as much as double life expectancy in the case of low- and intermediate-grade gliomas. Moreover, not only prognosis but also treatment choices can be guided by the tumor’s molecular/genetic alterations as summarized in Table 4 .\n\n【107】Table 4 Molecular/Genetic Markers in Glioma and Their Clinical Relevance—a Road Map for Future Advances in Treatment\n\n| Molecular alteration in glioma | Clinical relevance |\n| --- | --- |\n| _MGMT_ promoter methylation | Sensitivity to alkylator chemotherapy (eg, TMZ) |\n\n| 1p/19q Codeletion | Positive prognostic marker. Identifies subgroup of gliomas responsive to alkylator-based chemotherapy as well as RT |\n| _IDH_ mutation | Positive prognostic marker. Identifies subgroup of patients with 1p/19q nondeleted oligodendroglioma who may benefit from alkylator chemotherapy |\n| 1p/19q Codeletion + _IDH_ mutation + _TERT_ mutation | This combination identifies one of the best prognostic categories for glioma patients |\n| Proneural gene expression profile | Identifies subgroup of patients with GBM who may benefit from bevacizumab added to RT-TMZ |\n\n【110】EGFR = epidermal growth factor receptor; GBM = glioblastoma multiforme; _IDH_ \\= isocitrate dehydrogenase gene; _MGMT_ \\= O <sup>6 </sup> \\-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene; RT = radiotherapy; _TERT_ \\= telomerase reverse transcriptase gene; TMZ = temozolomide.\n\n【111】With the ever-growing importance of genetic alterations to determine prognosis and treatment choices, the diagnostic labels that we ascribe to tumors is shifting from the standard WHO grades II, III, and IV to one of molecularly based diagnoses. This transition toward molecular classification of gliomas has been evolving over the past 10 to 15 years and reached a tipping point in 2015 when 3 groups (Mayo Clinic/University of California, San Francisco,\n\n【112】Glioma groups based on 1p/19q, _IDH_ , and _TERT_ promoter mutations in tumors.\n\n【113】the Cancer Genome Atlas Network (TCGA) group, and the Japanese group led by Suzuki et al\n\n【114】Mutational landscape and clonal architecture in grade II and III gliomas.\n\n【115】) concurrently published their findings that converged on the same conclusion: that molecularly based diagnosis is superior to diagnosis based on conventional histologic and morphological features of tumor cells. For example, although we would typically expect the prognosis to be grade dependent, exceptions to this general rule are often encountered—eg, a patient with a grade IV/high-grade tumor may have a much longer life expectancy than one who has a grade III/intermediate-grade or even grade II/low-grade tumor. Furthermore, there can be considerable variability in histology-based diagnosis among neuropathologists because of the relatively subjective nature of interpreting cell morphology, nuclear atypia, number of mitotic figures, and other morphological characteristics that determine tumor type and grade. This issue is in contrast to the more binary nature of interpreting genetic tests—for example, 1p/19q alleles are either codeleted or they are not. Along these lines, the aforementioned 3 articles published in 2015 reveal that patients with brain tumors can be grouped into diagnostic clusters based on genetic alterations in which a tumor harboring triple positivity (1p/19q deletion, _IDH_ mutation, _TERT_ \\[telomerase reverse transcriptase gene\\]/telomerase mutation) presents one of the best prognostic groups. Conversely, a tumor harboring none of the alterations portends a prognosis similar to grade IV astrocytoma (glioblastoma) even if the histology may be grade II or III. As such, the 2016 WHO classification of central nervous system tumors has been extensively revised to incorporate genetic alterations.\n\n【116】The 2016 World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System: a summary.\n\n【117】This more accurate classification scheme will also influence future clinical studies, in which eligibility for a specific clinical study will be based more on molecular genetic alterations.\n\n【118】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【119】The shift of the neuro-oncology field toward individualized medicine represents a molecular revolution built on a steadfast evolution and accumulation of many years of rigorous basic and translational research. The past decade that has seen tremendous advances in treatments that prolong life for patients with brain tumors was the product of many preceding years of research. As we look ahead, we rely on the exponential increase in our understanding of glioma biology to serve as fuel for an even better future for our patients. If the numerous scientific advances listed in Table 4 serve in any way as an indicator of what lies ahead, then we can be optimistic.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Hypertensive diseases in pregnancy incur, as for hypertension in general, the occurrence of endothelial dysfunction, the latter characterized by impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation and a propensity towards a proinflammatory, procoagulant, “activated” endothelial phenotype. Such endothelial abnormalities may be further exacerbated by the hemodynamic stress imposed by the systemic and regional hyperperfusion occurring in a hypertensive pregnancy; this is in contrast with the innocuousness of hyperperfusion occurring in a nonhypertensive normal pregnancy with a healthy endothelium. The adverse consequences of endothelial dysfunction in conjunction with systemic hypertension may be manifested, in particular, in organs that are highly vascularized and endothelium-enriched such as the kidney. Pathogenetic pathways, instigated and imprinted during HDP, and targeting and hemodynamically stressing the abundant endothelium in the renal vasculature and glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments, are thereby entrained, and will continue to smolder in these major renal compartments long after pregnancy; CKD is thus variably manifested in ensuing years after pregnancy.\n\n【2】The strengths of this study by Oshunbade et al are multiple and include the following: its use of the GENOA database; the relatively large sample size; the determination of GFR by urinary iothalamate clearance; and a cohort that included both African Americans and White patients. This timely study adds important new evidence that HDP casts a long shadow of disease which extends way beyond the pregnancy itself and may culminate, specifically, in CKD.\n\n【3】Osteoporosis is Generally Attended by Worse Outcomes in Men as Compared With Women\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Communicating With Clinicians in Times of a Pandemic and Burnout\n----------------------------------------------------------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

One third of patients are actively bleeding when they present to the emergency department, and hematoma growth during the first hours after ICH onset is thought to be a prime determinant of clinical deterioration. Inflammation, as opposed to ischemia, also negatively affects patient condition. Recombinant activated factor VII is emerging as a potential first-line therapy, especially in warfarin-associated hemorrhage. Corticosteroid therapy is not supported by contemporary studies or by current management guidelines. Aggressive blood pressure reduction is under investigation. Surgical intervention has shown no statistically significant benefit over medical management for patients with ICH in general, although subgroup analysis in a large randomized trial suggested potential benefits from surgery for patients with lobar ICH. Not long ago, ICH was considered virtually untreatable.

Intracerebral hemorrhage is the most lethal type of stroke, with an overall mortality of 40% to 50%.\n\n【5】Until recently, this catastrophic illness was considered virtually untreatable, and attention was focused on prevention. However, recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms of brain injury in ICH have resulted in promising possibilities for clinical intervention.\n\n【6】HEMATOMA CONTROL\n----------------\n\n【7】When a patient presents to the emergency department (ED) with ICH, the physician's first priority is to stop the bleeding. Both clinical experience and scientific investigation have shown that larger hematoma volumes are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. In a population-based study, Broderick et al demonstrated that hematoma volume was the most accurate predictor of outcome . Using serial computed tomographic scans, Brott et al\n\n【8】Early hemorrhage growth in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\n【9】documented that up to 30% of patients are actively bleeding when they present to the ED. Furthermore, hematoma growth has been found to be an independent determinant of both mortality and functional outcome.\n\n【10】Hematoma growth is a determinant of mortality and poor outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\n【11】Between 8% and 14% of all ICHs occur in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy, and these patients have a higher rate of rapid clinical deterioration.\n\n【12】Management and prognostic features of intracerebral hemorrhage during anticoagulant therapy: a Swedish multicenter study.\n\n【13】In the past, the goal of reversing the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients experiencing coagulopathy or in those taking warfarin was to prevent recurrence of bleeding. Because many of these patients have ongoing hemorrhage at presentation, rapid reversal is critical to limit hematoma expansion and clinical deterioration. Until recently, administration of fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) in combination with vitamin K was believed to be the fastest, most effective reversal strategy. However, emerging information suggests that prothrombin complex concentrates (PCCs) or recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) may complement vitamin K in the urgent treatment of warfarin-associated ICH.\n\n【14】FIGURE 1 Plot shows 30-day outcomes for 162 patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) as measured by the modified Oxford Handicap Scale according to the volume of parenchymal hemorrhage: 0 = no symptoms; 1 = minor symptoms that do not interfere with lifestyle; 2 = minor handicap; 3 = moderate handicap; 4 = moderately severe handicap; and 5 = severe handicap. From _Stroke_ , with permission.\n\n【15】Prothrombin complex concentrates have been used to treat warfarin-associated ICH in Europe for many years. They contain coagulation factors VII, X, XI, prothrombin, and proteins C and S in concentrated form. The dose depends on the factor XI content and can vary greatly among preparations. Studies have demonstrated that PCCs can normalize an INR more rapidly than FFP and do not require thawing or compatibility testing.\n\n【16】Experts recommend concomitant administration of vitamin K. Thrombotic events have been reported with PCC infusion.\n\n【17】Treatment of warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage: literature review and expert opinion .\n\n【18】Large, controlled trials are needed to quantify the risks and benefits of this potential therapy.\n\n【19】Recombinant activated factor VII was developed as a treatment for hemophilic patients with antibodies to factors VIII and IX. It has been investigated as a treatment to control bleeding in major trauma and surgical catastrophes, raising the possibility of its usefulness in other devastating forms of hemorrhage.\n\n【20】Recombinant activated factor VII for adjunctive hemorrhage control in trauma.\n\n【21】It has a half-life of 2.3 hours, effectively reverses an elevated INR, and accelerates coagulation in patients with normal ratios.\n\n【22】Recombinant factor VIIa for rapid reversal of warfarin anticoagulation in acute intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n【23】Recombinant activated factor VII for acute intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\n【24】Freeman et al\n\n【25】Recombinant factor VIIa for rapid reversal of warfarin anticoagulation in acute intracranial hemorrhage.\n\n【26】demonstrated the rapid normalization of INR in warfarin-related brain hemorrhage in 1 of the first reported clinical investigations of the use of rFVIIa in ICH. The rapidity with which rFVIIa normalizes INR makes it ideally suited for facilitating neurosurgical intervention and potentially limiting hematoma growth. However, the duration of the effect of rFVIIa has yet to be defined. Experience has shown that the effects of warfarin last longer than those of rFVIIa, necessitating the simultaneous administration of FFP and vitamin K. The most effective dosing and timing of these agents remain an active area of investigation.\n\n【27】The promise shown by rFVIIa in treating spontaneous ICH is not limited to anticoagulation or coagulopathy. Mayer et al\n\n【28】Recombinant activated factor VII for acute intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\n【29】published encouraging results from a phase 2 trial in which 399 patients with spontaneous ICH were randomized to receive placebo or 1 of 3 doses of rFVIIa within 3 hours of symptom onset. Overall, patients who received rFVIIa had less hematoma growth, less edema, and smaller total lesion volume (blood plus surrounding edema) compared with those who received placebo. The treated group had a 38% relative reduction in mortality and a dose-related trend toward improved morbidity. However, complications, including acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, occurred more frequently in treated patients.\n\n【30】On February 26, 2007, the results of the phase 3 trial investigating the use of rFVIIa in ICH without coagulopathy were released to the public by the manufacturer. The trial involved 821 patients from 22 countries who were confirmed by computed tomography to have spontaneous ICH. These patients were randomized to receive either rFVIIa or placebo within 4 hours of symptom onset. The treated group had less hematoma growth and improved clinical outcomes at 15 days. However, the primary end point of improved mortality and less severe disability at 90 days was not significantly different between the 2 groups.\n\n【31】DAMAGE CONTROL\n--------------\n\n【32】The pathophysiology of brain injury in ICH remains a topic of debate. Perihematomal injury is widely agreed to result in edema and mass effect, producing the observed clinical deterioration seen in many of these patients. However, the mechanisms of injury are not well understood. Previously, swelling of the tissue was hypothesized to lead to a mechanical, localized infarction of brain parenchyma.\n\n【33】These ischemic areas were believed to stimulate the body's inflammatory cascade, producing vasogenic edema. In an attempt to visually demonstrate this phenomenon, Powers et al\n\n【34】Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow surrounding acute (6 to 22 hours) intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\n【35】used positron emission tomographic scanning to evaluate the blood flow to the perihematomal tissue. Surprisingly, the images showed that the blood flow to these areas was unchanged. Ischemia may not be the prevailing trigger for the massive perihematomal inflammatory response seen after an acute ICH. The prevailing theory is that coagulation end products activate the inflammatory cascade leading to vasogenic edema, cytotoxic edema, and disruption of the blood-brain barrier, amplifying the damage caused by the primary hematoma.\n\n【36】Although treatment with corticosteroids was proposed as a logical management option, early clinical trials of the value of dexamethasone administration in patients with acute stroke have failed to demonstrate efficacy.\n\n【37】In fact, a randomized controlled trial was terminated early because the dexamethasone group had a significantly higher rate of complications, such as infection and hyperglycemia, in the absence of clinical benefit.\n\n【38】Effects of dexamethasone in primary supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage.\n\n【39】A 2005 Cochrane comprehensive review on the use of corticosteroids for aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage and primary ICH found insufficient evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions.\n\n【40】Accordingly, treatment of patients with ICH with corticosteroids cannot be recommended at this time.\n\n【41】As the understanding of the mechanism of injury shifts from ischemia to inflammation, management of blood pressure in ICH patients may also change. Historically, physicians have taken care not to lower blood pressure too aggressively because rapidly lowering blood pressure may increase the area of ischemia. This caution was justifiable when perihematomal ischemia was believed to lead to increased morbidity. However, studies examining autoregulation and cerebral perfusion after blood pressure reduction in ICH have shown no significant change in blood flow if the pressure is lowered by 20% or less in the acute phase.\n\n【42】These findings are consistent with the American Heart Association recommendation to maintain mean arterial pressure below 130 mm Hg in patients with acute ICH.\n\n【43】Guidelines for the management of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: a statement for healthcare professionals from a special writing group of the Stroke Council, American Heart Association.\n\n【44】Now that the inflammatory cascade, rather than ischemia, may be an important determinant of outcome, aggressive blood pressure management may actually be helpful. This hypothesis has not been rigorously tested and represents an opportunity for future investigation.\n\n【45】Intuitively, surgical evacuation of the hematoma would give patients the best chance for favorable outcome. Indeed, in the early 1990s, rapid surgical intervention became the focus of investigation in acute ICH. However, this benefit has not been demonstrated. In studies by Morgenstern et al and Zuccarello et al,\n\n【46】Early surgical treatment for supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage: a randomized feasibility study.\n\n【47】surgical evacuation for ICH initiated within hours of onset did not improve outcome. The International Surgical Treatment in Intracerebral Haemorrhage (STICH) trial randomized 1033 patients to early surgical hematoma evacuation vs conservative therapy.\n\n【48】Early surgery versus initial conservative treatment in patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haematomas in the International Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Haemorrhage (STICH): a randomised trial.\n\n【49】The STICH authors\n\n【50】Early surgery versus initial conservative treatment in patients with spontaneous supratentorial intracerebral haematomas in the International Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Haemorrhage (STICH): a randomised trial.\n\n【51】reported no statistically significant difference between the 2 approaches with regard to mortality or morbidity. Because the study had several limitations, some questions remain. A subgroup analysis suggested that patients with lobar hematomas located 1 cm or less from the cortical surface may be more likely to have a favorable outcome with early surgical treatment. However, the authors themselves questioned the statistical significance of this finding. The STICH II trial, designed to investigate medical vs surgical management of these lobar hemorrhages, is under way.\n\n【52】Because surgical removal of the hematoma does not appear to universally improve outcome, investigation into other methods of controlling the toxicity of blood components is warranted. Red blood cells and their contents are resorbed slowly for several days to several weeks, exposing the brain parenchyma to toxicity for a prolonged interval. Several investigators are examining potential pharmacologic therapies that would protect brain cells from the toxic effects of a resolving hematoma.\n\n【53】Hyperosmolar therapy in the form of mannitol or hypertonic saline is occasionally used to treat ICH. Although this treatment has not yet been evaluated by a randomized, blinded, controlled trial, a recent study did find improved outcomes in patients with impending herniation who were treated with osmotic agents. As such, hyperosmolar therapy remains an option in patients with signs of mass effect, herniation, or both.\n\n【54】The publication of 2 articles reporting improved neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest has revitalized interest in the use of induced hypothermia as a neuroprotective agent in acute stroke.\n\n【55】Treatment of comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with induced hypothermia.\n\n【56】The use of hypothermia for treatment of ICH was reported as early as 1956.\n\n【57】Multiple laboratory experiments using animal models have shown that lowering the core temperature protects the blood-brain barrier through various cellular and biochemical mechanisms. However, complications have been reported in clinical trials of surface-cooling techniques, including infectious complications, clotting abnormalities, cardiac arrhythmias, and difficulty in rapidly achieving target temperatures.\n\n【58】Localized brain cooling has been proposed as an alternative to whole-body cooling for patients with neurologic insults. A recent study using a porcine model of ICH demonstrated decreased blood-brain barrier permeability and a marked reduction in vasogenic edema with localized brain cooling.\n\n【59】Clinical trials of the value of induced hypothermia for neuroprotection are needed to identify appropriate candidates, optimal target temperatures, and the ideal duration of therapy.\n\n【60】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【61】Intracerebral hemorrhage is a catastrophic event with high morbidity and mortality. Patients may still be actively bleeding at presentation, necessitating rapid reversal of anticoagulation. The emergence of rFVIIa as a potential treatment of ongoing bleeding has shown promise for patients with warfarin-related ICH, an increasingly common public health problem. The negative results of the phase 3 study of rFVIIa for patients with ICH who did not have coagulation defects are disappointing. Detailed analysis of those results has not been completed, however, and so inference at this time should be tentative. New experimental and clinical studies of the interaction between blood pressure and cerebral edema may lead us to rethink the management of blood pressure. The first STICH trial, evaluating early surgical intervention, did not demonstrate a benefit of surgery over medical management. The STICH II trial is already under way to investigate medical vs surgical management of lobar hemorrhages. Induced hypothermia has reemerged as a potential neuroprotective agent. Because of diligent efforts in both bench and clinical research, hope is emerging in the treatment of ICH, a catastrophic event that was not long ago thought to be virtually untreatable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

To achieve uniformity and improve the quality and comparison of ongoing studies, a panel of leading authorities issued a consensus statement containing the criteria that we listed in our review article.\n\n【2】Dr Cooney correctly points out that the only criterion distinguishing CRPS type 1 from type 2 is the presence of an identifiable peripheral nerve lesion in the latter. The signs and symptoms may be within or beyond the distribution of that peripheral nerve. All other clinical signs and symptoms are identical in CRPS types 1 and 2. Electrodiagnostic testing may identify a major peripheral nerve injury supporting the diagnosis of CRPS type 2 but may be insensitive to lesions of cutaneous sensory nerves (eg, sensory dorsal radial neuralgia/ neuropathy). The other tests of autonomic function may be identical in types 1 and 2. Sympathetically maintained pain can coexist with sympathetically independent pain in both types. Thus, a response to sympathetic blockade is not a distinguishing feature or diagnostic criterion for either type.\n\n【3】Dr Cooney also correctly points out that correction of any reversible underlying pathology is essential. Functional restoration can only occur with adequate rehabilitative modalities, usually physical therapy. As Dr Cooney stated, rehabilitation can be achieved only if adequate analgesia is provided by temporary neural blockade (either sympathetic or somatic), enteral or parenteral medications, neurolysis (release of entrapped nerves), or neuroaugmentation. A multidisciplinary approach to treatment often offers the best hope for reversing the inevitable biopsychosocial deconditioning that occurs with both CRPS type 1 and type 2.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Validated tools were used to assess burnout. Physicians also rated the leadership qualities of their immediate supervisor in 12 specific dimensions on a 5-point Likert scale. All supervisors were themselves physicians/scientists. A composite leadership score was calculated by summing scores for the 12 individual items (range, 12-60; higher scores indicate more effective leadership).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of the 3896 physicians surveyed, 2813 (72.2%) responded. Supervisor scores in each of the 12 leadership dimensions and composite leadership score strongly correlated with the burnout and satisfaction scores of individual physicians (all _P_ <.001). On multivariate analysis adjusting for age, sex, duration of employment at Mayo Clinic, and specialty, each 1-point increase in composite leadership score was associated with a 3.3% decrease in the likelihood of burnout ( _P_ <.001) and a 9.0% increase in the likelihood of satisfaction ( _P_ <.001) of the physicians supervised. The mean composite leadership rating of each division/department chair (n=128) also correlated with the prevalence of burnout (correlation=–0.330; _r_ <sup><em>2 </em></sup> \\=0.11; _P_ <.001) and satisfaction (correlation=0.684; _r_ <sup><em>2 </em></sup> \\=0.47; _P_ <.001) at the division/department level.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The leadership qualities of physician supervisors appear to impact the well-being and satisfaction of individual physicians working in health care organizations.

{"seq_id": "2b70628f-c786-41f8-8361-18d012971dea", "title": "Mayo Health System: A Decade of Achievement", "text": "【0】Mayo Health System: A Decade of Achievement\nIn 1992, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, faced several major challenges. It was confronted with an array of efforts at both the state and the national level to change the way health care was funded and delivered. Mayo Clinic Rochester received more than half its patient volume from within a 120-mile radius, which included portions of Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Mayo leaders anticipated insurance and delivery system changes imposed by the Health Care Financing Administration (now called the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) that included limited patient access across defined geographic boundaries. Such changes might have greatly limited the ability of many patients to travel to the Mayo Clinic for their care. Competing specialty groups sought to acquire regional physician practices that had traditionally sent patients with complex conditions to the Mayo Clinic. In addition, managed care organizations were growing and thriving in the Minneapolis-St Paul area, just 80 miles away, and to a lesser extent in other nearby communities. This movement put some of Mayo's referral activity at risk.\n\n【1】Health care groups across the United States were dealing with similar concerns. One frequent response involved acquisition of regional physician practices, especially by hospitals, to create vertically integrated provider networks. It was hoped that such systems would increase referral flow, create a provider base for insurance contracting, provide an advantage over competitors, and improve regional or community health care delivery. All too often, however, these provider networks failed to achieve desired financial, quality, and integration goals. One report based on 2001 data assessed the loss for hospital-owned multispecialty practices at more than $75,000 per physician.\n\n【2】Such networks also found it challenging to align and engage these new providers within a culture of integrated delivery systems.\n\n【3】The Mayo Clinic, however, had a model it believed would work. Mayo had experienced considerable success through acquisition of its 2 Rochester, Minn, hospitals in 1986, which in turn allowed subsequent integration of clinic and hospital operations. This integration had achieved major efficiencies and improvement in its patient care delivery. It was hoped that this model could be duplicated with similar success in both the surrounding region and in the other Mayo Clinic locations.\n\n【4】Mayo Clinic's response was to create its own regional provider network. Mayo's patient-oriented vision, strong reputation for quality, considerable resources, model of integrated physician and hospital engagement, strong physician leadership base, and previous success performing outreach in many surrounding communities prepared it for this endeavor.\n\n【5】The Mayo Clinic sought to acquire a number of successful physician practices, and many of the community hospitals associated with these practices, and to integrate community clinic and hospital activities, preferably on a single medical campus. It sought to infuse this process with Mayo Clinic values and resources, to engage the practices in the Mayo Clinic model of continuous quality improvement, and to align these operations, to the extent possible, with those of Mayo Clinic Rochester. The ultimate goal was to create a high-quality, financially self-sufficient provider network with unencumbered patient access to the Mayo Clinic for complex specialty care.\n\n【6】The initial vision and structure for the Mayo Health System were due in large part to the efforts of Michael B. O'Sullivan, MD, and James G. Anderson, the first paired physician and administrator leaders of the Mayo Health System. Their plans were launched with the acquisition of a 6-member medical practice in Decorah, Iowa, in early 1992. Later that year, the much larger (87 physicians) Midelfort Clinic in Eau Claire, Wis, merged with Luther Hospital to become an integrated medical center and the second member of the Mayo Health System. The Mayo Health System has since grown to its current complement of 13 wholly owned organizations employing more than 600 physicians and 11,100 allied health staff who practice in 62 communities in portions of 3 states. Each organization consists of either a stand-alone, taxable clinic or a functionally integrated hospital and clinic. Most of these organizations also have several regional satellite operations. The Mayo Health System now includes 13 clinics or combined clinic and hospital medical centers, ranging in size from 4 to 160 physicians and incorporating 14 owned hospitals, 8 owned nursing homes, and several other hospital and nursing home facilities under management contract .\n\n【7】Figure 1 Current map of the Mayo Health System with its 13 service areas.\n\n【8】Now, after a decade of development, the Mayo Health System has been deemed a success as judged by a wide spectrum of measures, including growth over a broad geographic area, recognition for use of “best practice” quality indicators, regional patient satisfaction, network financial success, regional patient referrals to Mayo Clinic Rochester, physician and administrator leadership development, and system-wide integration actions. These achievements have occurred despite challenges related to local competition, culture development, access to capital, and building of infrastructure.\n\n【9】It is reasonable to ask why the Mayo Health System has thrived as a vertically integrated regional health care delivery system during a time when other equally ambitious integration projects have not. Several factors have contributed to its success: (1) true physician leadership, which helps maintain patient-focused activities throughout the system; (2) acquisition of physician groups of demonstrated quality; (3) system framework that allows continued local operational control, local leadership, and sound local accountability, introduced before acquisition; (4) a consensus-driven approach to system development; (5) Upper Midwest location with smaller communities, less managed care, and prior provider consolidation; (6) true commitment to community-based health care solutions with rebuilding of local infrastructure and recruitment of both primary care and specialty providers; (7) the Mayo Clinic's reputation for efficient, high-quality health care delivery; and (8) considerable Mayo Clinic resources available to support a regional health care delivery system.\n\n【10】This article describes how the Mayo Health System was created and has developed over the past decade. It highlights the benefits that have accrued to its patients, communities, and physician practices as well as the value it has brought to the Mayo Clinic. It is hoped that this experience will provide helpful insights to other groups struggling with similar challenges.\n\n【11】10 Mayo Health System Building Blocks\n-------------------------------------\n\n【12】The creation of a large physician and hospital network required a multitude of planning sessions and critical decision making. These, in turn, have resulted in both outstanding achievements and a variety of “educational” setbacks. This discussion focuses on the 10 “building blocks” that we think have contributed most to the overall success of the network.\n\n【13】### 1\\. Vision.\n\n【14】The initial vision for the Mayo Health System has not changed over time. It seeks to link high-quality community care systems with the outstanding specialty care of Mayo Clinic Rochester in order “to achieve the highest standards for medical care and health improvement in the communities in which we live and work.” It builds on the Mayo Clinic primary value: “The needs of the patient come first.”\n\n【15】Key underlying principles written into each merger contract include requirements for physician leadership, local economic self-sufficiency, relative local autonomy in operational decision making, and a commitment to local quality of care.\n\n【16】Branding issues were resolved early for the Mayo Health System. To maintain respect for local cultures and organizations and to distinguish the regional network from the Mayo Clinic's primary specialty campus, the Mayo Health System elected to use the original or geographic title for regional clinics and medical centers. Each local name is followed by the endorsing line, “Mayo Health System” (for example, Austin Medical Center-Mayo Health System).\n\n【17】Provider collaboration across all Mayo sites is encouraged through a philosophy of “partners in care.” Clinical departments are encouraged to plan and interact with their peer groups across the entire region. Administrative collaboration results in the sharing of scarce resources among the component entities. Patient choice of a referral center is honored, and the Mayo Clinic strives to be the worthy recipient of the referrals it receives.\n\n【18】### 2\\. Governance.\n\n【19】Mayo Health System organizations are owned solely by Mayo Foundation, except for 1 joint venture, Franciscan Skemp Healthcare in La Crosse, Wis, which has dual corporate sponsorship by Mayo Foundation and the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration. The initial covenant between any health center, clinic, or hospital and Mayo Clinic is designed as a permanent arrangement, with a view that the merged entities will work together for long-term success and benefit to the communities they serve.\n\n【20】Mayo Health System's governance includes a tiered multiboard structure. Each local entity reports to the Mayo Clinic, and ultimate authority resides with Mayo Foundation, the parent organization of Mayo Clinic Rochester. Regularly scheduled meetings are held between local Mayo Health System leaders and Mayo Clinic Rochester's Board of Governors to optimize communication and planning. Continued involvement of community board members emphasizes the importance of engaging community leaders in decisions about management and services appropriate for each location.\n\n【21】The Mayo Clinic has reserved certain authority for oversight and determination of policy, and the same Mayodefined reserved powers apply to all entities. These reserved powers are unchanged from the inception of the health system and include approval of strategic plans of individual practices, annual capital and operating budgets, fee schedules, new programs and services, compensation, changes in employee benefits, incurrence of debt, any transfer of assets other than in the ordinary course of business, large capital expenditures by item or aggregate program, professional staff requests, rights of corporate members under state law, and bylaw amendments, mergers, or other fundamental changes.\n\n【22】The Mayo Health System was designed to include regional administrative governing boards. These boards were initially grouped geographically and were representational. For example, the 4 boards for Iowa, Minnesota, west central Wisconsin, and La Crosse had members from each of the practice sites in those regions. Mayo maintained the majority control on the governing boards by a delegated appointment system. In actuality, there has not been a vote on a controversial item that split strictly along the lines of Mayo Health System entity representatives vs Mayo Clinic representatives. The appeal to each regional board member is to consider his or her role in serving the system rather than allegiance to any particular entity or program.\n\n【23】Although each organization joined the Mayo Health System with full knowledge of the other entities within the system, there was no sense of linkage among the sites—in fact, some had been competitors. After several years of being asked to perform joint planning for system-wide quality initiatives, to distribute allocated capital funds transferred to the Mayo Health System by Mayo Foundation, and to periodically assist adjacent organizations with their health care delivery, the Mayo Health System sites began to see the benefits of sharing of resources within the system, economies of scale, and joint strategic planning. As trust has grown in nonrepresentational functions such as capital planning and allocation, strategic planning has led to discussion and approval (January 2003) of the concept of a single board . This new Mayo Health System Board has 16 members, half of whom are regional practice leaders and half who are Mayo Clinic Rochester leaders, including 2 members of the Mayo Clinic Rochester Board of Governors. The single-board concept recognizes that the Mayo Health System is a cooperative health system with geographic alliances and cooperation across service lines. The benefit derived from improvements in management and governance has augmented support for the singleboard concept. This decade-long process of change exemplifies the principle that governance is not a static process but rather an evolutionary one.\n\n【24】Figure 2 Current reporting structure for the Mayo Health System (MHS). FSPA = Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration.\n\n【25】### 3\\. Strategic Planning.\n\n【26】The Mayo Health System performed its first thorough strategic planning effort in 1995. This effort focused on defining the mission and principles for the system, a vision for linking education and research between the Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Health System, and defining the organizational options for linking the clinical practices across all entities. Since then, there have been 2 broadly based planning efforts focused on the entire Mayo Health System strategy and annual update efforts focused on a few new core goals for the system.\n\n【27】The last comprehensive strategic planning effort for the Mayo Health System occurred in 2001. A major impetus for this exercise came from the Mayo Foundation Board of Trustees, who inquired about long-term plans for growth in the overall size of the system and in the specialties within the system. This analysis sought to align and optimize all Mayo Clinic patient care activities across the region. While seeking to accomplish this task, Mayo Health System organizations recognized that their own strategic plan goals, both individual and as part of an integrated system, needed to derive from and be consistent with those of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. It also became clear that the previous Mayo Health System core goals meshed with those of Mayo Clinic Rochester. These core goals included growth and integration, financial success, staff and patient satisfaction, quality and service, innovation and scholarship, and the future of the health care environment.\n\n【28】A major initiative within the most recent strategic planning effort was a rigorous, data-driven review of past and future provider growth plans at each Mayo Health System organization. This review yielded anticipated system-wide provider growth plans of 5% to 8% per year. This growth included both acquisition of current providers within communities and incremental additions. These data allow a more robust joint planning effort for growth and patient access in all Mayo Health System locations, including Mayo Clinic Rochester. The data also have stimulated considerable debate about the implications of growth on the availability of limited strategic capital to accommodate that growth, implications for specialists at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, and the ability of the Mayo Health System to manage the local cultural and group dynamics created by too rapid an infusion of new young providers into a site. Most of the requested growth came from 2 of the larger organizations that are each building new facilities, and this issue has yet to be fully resolved.\n\n【29】### 4\\. Operations.\n\n【30】The main operational arm for Mayo Health System patient care issues is the Medical Directors Committee. It is composed of physician medical directors of each of the 13 primary organizations and several Mayo Clinic leaders. Key support subcommittees for this group include operations, information technology, and performance measurement (eg, quality oversight).\n\n【31】Each Mayo Health System organization has a paired physician and administrative liaison from the Mayo Clinic working with it and attending periodic local board and management committee meetings. These vital liaisons to the local practices serve as mentors, coaches, consultants, problem solvers, advocates, and purveyors of Mayo Clinic culture.\n\n【32】Some Mayo Clinic leaders engaged with the Mayo Health System also serve on the Mayo Clinic's Clinical Practice Committee, the operational oversight body for the Mayo Clinic Rochester practice. This presence allows needed practice links in terms of alignment of practice philosophy, resource and policy deployment, and issue resolution.\n\n【33】Major operational activities for the Mayo Health System include the use of integrated work groups to study and implement system strategic core goals. Such goals include delivering high-value, safe medical care to our patients, developing systems for “seamless” health care delivery within and among the practice sites, providing care in the most appropriate location for our patients, becoming a highly desirable employer in each of our practice communities, and optimizing peer group interactions across all our systems.\n\n【34】### 5\\. Quality Assurance.\n\n【35】The Mayo Health System was created in large part by acquiring, supporting, and integrating medical groups that were already performing reasonably well and that had an interest in delivering high-quality health care services. Those organizations clearly understood and supported the premise that their participation in the Mayo Health System meant that the Mayo Clinic would emphasize and nurture their focus on the delivery of quality health care. One result of the many efforts directed toward this quality focus is that 4 Mayo Health System organizations have won national awards for health care quality during the past 4 years.\n\n【36】The Medical Directors Committee recognized early on that quality oversight would be an important function within the Mayo Health System. Therefore, a performance measurement committee was appointed to serve that purpose. This committee has developed a quality “dashboard” to monitor and promote quality efforts across the Mayo Health System. This dashboard highlights actions in 5 areas: preventive services, clinical outcomes/disease management strategies (both acute and chronic), patient safety, patient service, and physician credentialing.\n\n【37】An early initiative within the Mayo Health System was the introduction of disease management strategies at each organization. This activity uses support and resources from a similar effort at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. Initial actions included the implementation of 8 preventive service guidelines throughout the system and development of management strategies to improve care for patients with diabetes mellitus. Subsequently, management strategies have been developed for 2 more chronic diseases. Results now compare favorably with those of many health care organizations receiving recognition for their efforts in treating these diseases.\n\n【38】A major patient safety effort was initiated soon after the Institute of Medicine report _To Err is Human_ was published in 2000. A collaboration was launched that included 15 teams from the Mayo Health System and 5 teams from Mayo Clinic Rochester and other health care organizations. Each of these teams has been progressively implementing 12 identified safety initiatives, including nonpunitive reporting policy, use of oral syringes only for oral medications, removal of concentrated electrolyte solutions from patient areas, establishment of sliding-scale insulin protocols, staff safety education, and integration of standard preprinted orders. This large 2-year effort has been highly successful, and it is gaining recognition as a model for other health care systems.\n\n【39】Another patient service initiative addresses “open access” for patients at most Mayo Health System sites. This change in the appointment process allows patients to decide when they would like to be seen, rather than granting an appointment time most convenient for their physician. During the past 4 years, 28 Mayo Health System locations have taken part in a Mayo Clinic collaborative effort related to open patient access.\n\n【40】### 6\\. Leadership Development.\n\n【41】Early in the development of the Mayo Health System, the need for a broad base of physician leaders within both the newly integrated medical centers and the stand-alone clinics became evident. For several larger organizations, it became necessary to transfer Mayo Clinic physician leaders and administrators to Mayo Health System entities that lacked such depth. However, the intention over time has been to develop and promote these leaders from within each Mayo Health System site.\n\n【42】The Mayo Health System has chosen to partner with the Executive Development Center of the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota to help create leadership courses for the Mayo Health System. This joint effort has received high praise from participants. Numerous leadership courses are available to Mayo Health System staff on the Mayo Clinic Rochester campus. In addition, the Mayo Health System offers 2 several-day sessions annually at a nearby retreat center. One session is designed for senior leadership teams, and the other is directed toward development of the next generation of leaders within each Mayo Health System organization. Peer group interactions and orientation to Mayo Clinic culture are major benefits derived from these sessions.\n\n【43】To standardize and package leadership training content, the Mayo Health System has developed a modular approach to education. Courses are updated annually, and their content focuses on 7 leadership modules: strategic leadership, people leadership, business know-how, professional leadership, communication, interpersonal skills, and personal attributes. Although both junior and senior leadership courses use these modules, the course content for the senior leaders has a stronger strategic focus.\n\n【44】Enhancement of local Mayo Health System board and governance functions is another priority. To meet this system need, the Mayo Health System hosts a 2-day annual retreat in Rochester for Mayo Health System public trustees and their senior medical center leadership teams to enhance local governance and strategic capabilities. Local succession planning and annual leadership and board evaluations are requested and encouraged.\n\n【45】### 7\\. Administration.\n\n【46】A major operational advantage conveyed to member groups within the Mayo Health System is central administrative support, a central office with key resource personnel who can call on a wide variety of additional business support personnel from throughout Mayo Foundation. An administrator from the central office is assigned to each Mayo Health System organization, and all senior administrators meet regularly to align, optimize, and advance their business functions. The central support costs amount to about 1% of Mayo Health System's total expenses. Additional administrative resource requests are charged to the sites requesting them.\n\n【47】Centrally based resources used extensively by Mayo Health System organizations include communications, contracting and payor relations, disease management strategies, facilities, finance and accounting, human resources, information technology, leadership education and development, marketing, patient financial services and compliance, physician recruitment, supply expense management, and systems and procedures.\n\n【48】### 8\\. Finance.\n\n【49】An important requirement implemented at the founding of the Mayo Health System was that each participating organization must remain financially sound. Each entity must “sustain the practice” (be able to fully support its own practice), including both operating expenses and working capital needs. At the outset, Mayo recognized that this requirement for local financial accountability also necessitated local autonomy in daily operations. In recent years, the Mayo Health System has had a target annual operating margin of 5% to allow sufficient funds for current operations, replacement of needed equipment and facilities, and growth and development of the system. Organizations integrated with their local hospitals are better able to achieve this level of financial performance. Most small hospitals have been granted “Critical Access Hospital” designation by the federal government, which allows government reimbursement on a cost basis as opposed to a prospective payment basis, and this designation helps their financial performance.\n\n【50】In 6 of the first 10 years of operation, the Mayo Health System has either sustained itself financially or come close to doing so. The annual operating margin is now about 2.0% to 2.5%, with a net operating income in the range of $18 million. In 2003, net medical revenue for the Mayo Health System will be about $1 billion .\n\n【51】Figure 3 Actual and planned growth of the Mayo Health System in terms of physicians and net revenue.\n\n【52】The original Mayo Clinic capital investment in the Mayo Health System went primarily toward market-based reimbursement for tangible assets of the acquired clinics and for limited infrastructure improvements of acquired hospitals in many of the communities.\n\n【53】In 1998, a Mayo Health System finance committee was established to provide central financial planning. Capital allocation from the limited annual pool of allocated funds from the Mayo Foundation has been the major task for this council. Representatives include chief executives and financial officers from several Mayo Health System organizations as well as both Mayo Health System and Mayo Clinic Rochester leaders. Formulas have been advanced to allocate capital funds based on a combination of local accumulated depreciation and local operating performance. The capital appetite always greatly exceeds available supply, but the perceived fairness of the allocation process has allowed a better understanding of financial issues throughout Mayo Foundation and has deflected many of the concerns of Mayo Health System leaders on this issue.\n\n【54】### 9\\. Integration.\n\n【55】Clearly, a major benefit to the Mayo Clinic and to our many Mayo Health System organizations is the ability to share resources, patient referrals, and medical information across all sites. Many initiatives have been tried, with variable success. Mayo Health System organizations have worked to avoid competition with other members of the system for the same patients and resources. The diffusion of knowledge and understanding among Mayo Clinic and Mayo Health System providers has been a slow but progressive process.\n\n【56】To facilitate planning and integration, many joint leadership and governance sessions have occurred. Educational efforts within Mayo Clinic Rochester have helped with this effort. During the past year, joint strategic planning between the Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Health System has accelerated to promote a dialogue regarding issues such as alignment of growth and access strategies. One such issue is the persistent tension between Mayo Clinic Rochester departments and Mayo Health System organizations regarding regional access to certain specialties such as cardiac surgery and neurosurgery.\n\n【57】A shared electronic medical records system is a high priority for the Mayo Health System, and this goal is now being realized. The sharing of clinical notes and laboratory data between Mayo Clinic and Mayo Health System locations has been determined to be most important. To achieve these goals, the Mayo Health System is completing a “Master Patient Identification Index” and a shared “Integrated Clinical Data Repository.”\n\n【58】Departments and peer groups from the Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Health System are encouraged to meet periodically to share ideas, continuing medical education efforts, and other resources. Several clinical departments have excelled in this effort.\n\n【59】### 10\\. Strategic Value.\n\n【60】#### For Patients.\n\n【61】Patients have experienced increased value from their local medical services since these organizations have joined the Mayo Health System. This value manifests as an increased number of local care providers, local availability and relatively seamless referral for more specialized care, a heightened emphasis on local medical quality and efficiency, improved local facilities, increased local health education and communication, improved ability to recruit and retain high-quality medical staff, and increased prospects within local communities for a long-term and stable health care delivery system. Patient satisfaction surveys and patient outcome studies have confirmed these benefits.\n\n【62】#### For Communities.\n\n【63】In many communities whose medical staffs joined the Mayo Health System, a financially stable delivery system was at risk. By integrating the local physician and hospital activities with those of the Mayo Clinic, these communities have greatly strengthened their likelihood of preserving a local health care option for their citizens in these financially distressed times for medicine. This benefit is particularly relevant for rural Midwestern communities, which are at the low end of the Medicare reimbursement spectrum.\n\n【64】Besides being a source of local pride and convenience for its citizens, local medical centers are a major source of jobs and local revenue. A recent study of the economic impact of the Mayo Health System in Minnesota during the year 2000 revealed that the system had a direct and indirect impact amounting to $570 million and more than 6000 jobs. The Mayo Health System is among the largest private employers in southeastern Minnesota.\n\n【65】#### For Mayo Clinic.\n\n【66】The driving force to create a regional physician and hospital network was the need to ensure that regional patients could continue to access the Mayo Clinic for their specialty health care needs. However, as the number of facilities and geographic area served have grown, it has become increasingly clear that the Mayo Clinic has accepted a new challenge of building and supporting a community-based health care delivery system. The region is 250 miles in diameter, involves portions of 3 states, and contains more than 2.5 million people.\n\n【67】Since the health system's inception, physician-referred patients from current Mayo Health System locations to Mayo Clinic Rochester have increased from 4800 to 14,000 patients per year. The number of patients coming to the Mayo Clinic from counties within 120 miles of Rochester has also increased, from 64,000 to 96,000 patients per year. This increase in the number of regional patients has created concerns about access capacity for national and international patients and has generated considerable discussion within Mayo Clinic Rochester. The Mayo Clinic remains a national and international referral center as well as regional health care provider.\n\n【68】Building on principles of relative local autonomy and financial self-sufficiency, the Mayo Health System has been able to sustain itself financially in recent years, and in the future, it should be able to fund its growth and practice innovation as well. This financial achievement is in stark contrast to that experienced by most regional referral networks in the United States.\n\n【69】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【70】Overall, the Mayo Health System has grown and developed as a complement to the Mayo Clinic in most respects. Its focus on quality, referral activity, peer group interactions, strong regional community presence, and robust spirit as a professional partner of the Mayo Clinic have all contributed to its highly successful first decade. The future looks bright for continued success.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Diagnostic markers of other common mesenchymal neoplasms of the kidney that are typically composed of bland spindle cell proliferations were absent (HMB45, Melan-A, smooth muscle actin). This immunophenotype excluded mesenchymal neoplasms such as angiomyolipoma and leiomyoma.\n\n【1】Based on the presence of focal biphasic features, the immunophenotype, and the cytogenic profile, the tumor was diagnosed as a mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma.\n\n【2】**Which of the following cytogenetic profiles supports a diagnosis of mucinous tubular and spindle cell carcinoma of the kidney?**\n\n【3】*   a.\n\n【4】    Gains of chromosome 7 and 17\n\n【5】*   b.\n\n【6】    Loss of the short arm of chromosome 3\n\n【7】*   c.\n\n【8】    Multiple losses of chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, and 22\n\n【9】*   d.\n\n【10】    Homozygous deletion of the _CDKN2A/B_ gene region\n\n【11】**Answer: c.

In North America, lung cancer has become more predominant among former than current smokers. Yet in some countries, such as China, which has experienced a dramatic increase in the cigarette smoking rate during the past 2 decades, a peak in lung cancer incidence is still expected. Approximately two-thirds of adult Chinese men are smokers, representing one-third of all smokers worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer accounts for 85% of all lung cancer cases in the United States. After the initial diagnosis, accurate staging of non-small cell lung cancer using computed tomography or positron emission tomography is crucial for determining appropriate therapy. When feasible, surgical resection remains the single most consistent and successful option for cure. However, close to 70% of patients with lung cancer present with locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Chemotherapy is beneficial for patients with metastatic disease, and the administration of concurrent chemotherapy and radiation is indicated for stage III lung cancer. The introduction of angiogenesis, epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, and other new anticancer agents is changing the present and future of this disease and will certainly increase the number of lung cancer survivors.

Nirenberg (1927- ), and Robert W. Holley (1922-1993), for research that helped to show how the genetic components of the cell nucleus control the synthesis of proteins. Khorana helped develop methods for investigating the structure of nucleic acids and many of the techniques that allowed scientists to decipher the genetic code, and he showed how RNA can specify the structure of proteins. These methods and techniques pioneered by Khorana have led to fundamental insights into the genetic code and the mechanism of gene regulation. Nirenberg developed the procedure for deciphering the genetic code in living cells, and Holley developed techniques for determining the structure of nucleic acids and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of alanine transfer ribonucleic acid.\n\n【1】Khorana was born on January 9, 1922, in Raipur, a small village in Punjab, now part of Pakistan. He was the youngest of 5 children (4 sons and 1 daughter) of a tax clerk for the British colonial government. Khorana was one of the few literate persons in his village, having attended the D.A.V. High School in Multan, Punjab. After receiving his secondary education, he entered the University of Punjab at Lahore, earning a BS degree in 1943 and an MS degree in 1945. His work was so outstanding that he was awarded a government scholarship to the University of Liverpool in England, from which he received a PhD degree in organic chemistry in 1948. While at the university, he became interested in the biochemistry of nucleic acids (large molecules found in the nucleus of the cell that carry genetic information).\n\n【2】Postdoctoral work took Khorana to Zurich, Switzerland, where he attended the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology from 1948 to 1949. After his work in Switzerland was completed, he visited his native country briefly in 1949. He then went to England and the University of Cambridge, where he had a fellowship from 1950 to 1952. During this fellowship, he worked with Sir Alexander Todd (1907-1997) and began research on nucleic acids and proteins and on the genetic code.\n\n【3】In 1952, Khorana became a faculty member and administrator at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, a position he held until 1960. In 1959, he received international recognition for the synthesis (with a colleague) of coenzyme A. In 1960, he was appointed codirector of the Institute for Enzyme Research at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, where he remained until 1970. While at the University of Wisconsin, he was awarded the Nobel Prize (1968) and became a naturalized American citizen (1966). In 1970, he became the Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Biology and Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Believing that moving was good for intellectual and personal development, Khorana left the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1974 to become the Andrew D. White Professor-at-Large at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, a position he held until 1980.\n\n【4】After receiving the Nobel Prize, Khorana succeeded in an even more striking accomplishment—in 1970, he announced that he had achieved the total synthesis of the first wholly artificial gene. In addition to the Nobel Prize, he received awards and honors from many different nations. He was honored on a stamp (Scott No. 2219d) issued by St Vincent and the Grenadines in 1995.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

It is the cancer most commonly associated with various paraneoplastic syndromes, including the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. Because of the high propensity of small cell lung cancer to metastasize early, surgery has a limited role as primary therapy. Although the disease is highly sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation, cure is difficult to achieve. The combination of platinum and etoposide is the accepted standard chemotherapeutic regimen. It is also the accepted standard therapy in combination with thoracic radiotherapy (TRT) for limited-stage disease. Adding TRT increases absolute survival by approximately 5% over chemotherapy alone. Thoracic radiotherapy administered concurrently with chemotherapy is more efficacious than sequential therapy. Furthermore, the survival benefit is greater if TRT is given early rather than late in the course of chemotherapy. Regardless of disease stage, no relevant survival benefit results from increased chemotherapy dose intensity or dose density, altered mode of administration (eg, alternating or sequential administration) of various chemotherapeutic agents, or maintenance chemotherapy. Prophylactic cranial radiation prevents central nervous system recurrence and can improve survival. In Japan and some other Asian countries, the combination of irinotecan and cisplatin is the standard chemotherapeutic regimen.

Before initiating febuxostat, her uric acid level had been 10.6 mg/dL.\n\n【3】*   1.\n\n【4】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ cause of this patient’s knee pain?**\n\n【5】    *   a.\n\n【6】        Cellulitis\n\n【7】    *   b.\n\n【8】        Septic arthritis\n\n【9】    *   c.\n\n【10】        Prepatellar bursitis\n\n【11】    *   d.\n\n【12】        Reactive arthritis\n\n【13】    *   e.\n\n【14】        Crystalline arthropathy\n\n【15】The patient’s clinical presentation and examination findings are concerning for an inflammatory process involving the knee, with the initial evaluation focused on differentiating between infectious versus noninfectious etiologies, intra-articular versus extra-articular processes, and systemic versus localized disease.\n\n【16】Given the patient’s severe pain with movement of the knee joint, an overlying cellulitis is less probable compared to a joint-related process. Cellulitis is also less likely to present with abrupt onset and with no preceding wound or ulceration.\n\n【17】Septic arthritis is a possibility as it frequently affects the knee with symptoms of swelling, warmth, and pain, as observed in our patient. In addition, this patient has risk factors for septic arthritis, including recent dental work, which can lead to transient bacteremia and hematogenous seeding. However, this diagnosis would be somewhat less likely in the absence of systemic symptoms, such as fever or malaise.\n\n【18】Prepatellar bursitis is possible as it commonly presents as an acute onset of knee pain, and patients are often unable to flex at the knee due to pain. This diagnosis is less likely, however, given her physical exam, as her knee was most tender superior to the patella; in the case of prepatellar bursitis, tenderness would be most pronounced anterior to the patella. In addition, pain would be less pronounced with rest, and there might be a history of frequent kneeling or recent trauma to the knee.\n\n【19】Reactive arthritis is less likely as it typically presents as an oligoarthritis most commonly in patients aged 20 to 40 years in days-to-weeks following an inciting enteric or genitourinary infection, which our patient did not have.\n\n【20】Altogether, this patient’s presentation is most consistent with a flare of crystalline arthritis, specifically gout, with rapid presentation and maximal symptomatic severity typically reached within a day of onset, in addition to significant inflammation on exam with minimal systemic symptoms. Her prior episodes of gout and other risk factors including post-menopausal status, chronic kidney disease, and furosemide therapy also increase the likelihood of this representing a flare. While her recent uric acid level was normal, gout flares can occur despite normouricemia or even hypouricemia. In addition, although long-term treatment with urate-lowering therapy can significantly reduce gout flares, it is very common for patients to continue to have flares during the year or so following initiation of therapy. Given this, the 2020 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Management of Gout strongly recommends administering concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis therapy (eg, colchicine, NSAIDs, or prednisone/prednisolone) to lower the risk of acute gout flares during the first months of anti-hyperuricemic therapy.\n\n【21】2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout.\n\n【22】In this patient’s case, she had only been taking febuxostat for approximately 3 months before this episode, and she had unfortunately not been on prophylactic therapy due to colchicine intolerance and was avoiding NSAIDs and systemic steroids given her chronic kidney disease and heart failure.\n\n【23】*   2.\n\n【24】    **What is the _best_ next step in diagnosis and management of this patient’s knee pain?**\n\n【25】    *   a.\n\n【26】        Plain radiographs\n\n【27】    *   b.\n\n【28】        Magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【29】    *   c.\n\n【30】        Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT)\n\n【31】    *   d.\n\n【32】        Diagnostic arthrocentesis\n\n【33】    *   e.\n\n【34】        Ultrasound\n\n【35】Plain radiographs would be helpful if there were suspicion for acute fracture or bony abnormality. However, other than potentially showing subcortical bone cysts without erosions or the classic juxta-articular “rat bite” lesions, plain radiographs are not typically helpful in diagnosing crystalline arthropathy. These radiographic findings are also associated with chronic gout and so are less likely to be seen in a patient with a relatively short history of gout.\n\n【36】Magnetic resonance imaging is sensitive in showing soft-tissue and osseous abnormalities, but findings observed in crystalline arthritis are not specific.\n\n【37】Dual-energy computed tomography can detect monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition within joints and soft tissues and is particularly useful for joints that are not amenable to aspiration or in cases in which there remains high suspicion for crystalline arthropathy despite negative aspiration. Dual-energy computed tomography can be falsely negative in patients with a first episode of gout and fewer than 6 weeks of symptoms.\n\n【38】Dual energy CT for the diagnosis of gout: an accuracy and diagnostic yield study.\n\n【39】However, the gold standard for gout diagnosis is joint arthrocentesis with polarized light microscopy to identify uric acid crystals within white blood cells. A further benefit of joint arthrocentesis is that aspirated synovial fluid can be sent for total nucleated cell count with differential as well as cultures if there remains a suspicion for coincident infection.\n\n【40】Ultrasound is useful to determine if a joint effusion is present that would be amenable to aspiration and to guide diagnostic arthrocentesis; however, it is not the gold standard for diagnosis of crystalline arthropathy.\n\n【41】One year before this patient’s current episode of acute knee pain, she had the onset of left mid-foot pain and was found to have a serum uric acid level of 11.2 mg/dL. In the weeks before the onset of her foot pain, she was having difficulty with episodes of congestive heart failure in the setting of her chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy. She had her medications adjusted on two occasions with improvement in heart failure symptoms. In evaluation of her foot pain, she underwent diagnostic arthrocentesis of the second tarsometatarsal joint with polarized light microscopy demonstrating intracellular uric acid crystals consistent with acute gout. Careful review and reconsideration of cardiac medications is important following a new diagnosis of gout. At the time of this initial gout flare, our patient was taking losartan, furosemide, spironolactone, and carvedilol. She had been placed on losartan after developing a persistent cough while taking lisinopril.\n\n【42】*   3.\n\n【43】    **Which antihypertensive is _most_ helpful to reduce gout exacerbations in this patient?**\n\n【44】    *   a.\n\n【45】        Lisinopril\n\n【46】    *   b.\n\n【47】        Losartan\n\n【48】    *   c.\n\n【49】        Furosemide\n\n【50】    *   d.\n\n【51】        Spironolactone\n\n【52】    *   e.\n\n【53】        Carvedilol\n\n【54】A large nested case-control study performed in the United Kingdom (involving more than 24,000 cases of incident gout in patients with hypertension and 50,000 matched controls) provided data showing the relative risk of incident gout with various antihypertensive drugs. Based on this data, the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors including lisinopril is associated with an increased risk of incident gout (relative risk 1.25). In contrast, the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan is associated with fewer gout exacerbations (relative risk \\[RR\\]: 0.81). Losartan reduces serum uric acid levels by producing a uricosuric effect that is not observed in non-losartan angiotensin receptor blockers. Diuretics as a group have the strongest increased risk of incident gout (RR: 2.36).\n\n【55】However, this risk differs among diuretics. Both thiazide and loop diuretics are known to increase serum uric acid and the risk of gout attacks by increasing renal urate reabsorption. In contrast, potassium-sparing diuretics appear to not significantly increase risk of incipient gout.\n\n【56】β-blockers such as carvedilol are associated with increased gout flares (RR: 1.48) as well as increased serum urate; however, the mechanism remains unclear.\n\n【57】Thus, among the antihypertensives with which our patient had been treated, losartan would have provided the most benefit. Although she was taking carvedilol and furosemide, which both would have increased her risk for gout, it was not believed that her medications could be changed given her significant cardiomyopathy.\n\n【58】The gout in our patient’s foot was initially treated with a short course of oral prednisone with symptomatic resolution. Subsequently, she started on allopurinol 100 mg daily in combination with colchicine 0.6 mg daily. Two weeks after initiating these medications, she developed a rash, fever, and diarrhea with an elevated C-reactive protein 26.7 mg/L (≤10 mg/L). Allopurinol was discontinued due to suspicion of a mild drug reaction. Colchicine was also discontinued given concern it was contributing to her diarrhea. After a few months off of therapy, she was started on febuxostat.\n\n【59】*   4.\n\n【60】    **Which of the following represents this patient’s _greatest_ risk factor for a severe allopurinol hypersensitivity reaction?**\n\n【61】    *   a.\n\n【62】        Chronic kidney disease\n\n【63】    *   b.\n\n【64】        Age 60 years or older\n\n【65】    *   c.\n\n【66】        Female sex\n\n【67】    *   d.\n\n【68】        Initial allopurinol dose less than or equal to 100 mg\n\n【69】    *   e.\n\n【70】        Caucasian ethnicity\n\n【71】A large study using US Medicaid data involving 400,401 allopurinol initiators identified 203 hospitalizations as a result of severe allopurinol hypersensitivity.\n\n【72】Racial/ethnic variation and risk factors for allopurinol-associated severe cutaneous adverse reactions: a cohort study.\n\n【73】Chronic kidney disease (RR: 2.3), age 60 years or older (RR: 1.7), female sex (RR: 2.5), and initial allopurinol dose greater than 100 mg (RR: 1.9) were all identified as independent risk factors. Asians, blacks, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders were also shown to be at greater risk of allopurinol hypersensitivity reactions, with RRS of 3.0, 3.0, and 6.7, respectively, compared with whites and Hispanics. This is explained by the higher prevalence of the _HLA-B∗5801_ allele in those ethnic groups. An important caveat to this study was that stages of chronic kidney disease were not separated, and it is possible that most of the patients in this study had earlier-stage kidney disease than our patient. Patients with more advanced kidney disease and lower glomerular filtration rate are significantly more likely to have severe hypersensitivity when the starting dose of allopurinol is not appropriately adjusted. Although this patient’s chronic kidney disease, age, and sex all increased her risk for a severe allopurinol hypersensitivity reaction, given her low allopurinol starting dose, her risk was likely increased the most by her sex. Some would advocate starting an even lower dose (100 mg alternating every other day with 50 mg) to further minimize any renal-related risk with her estimated glomerular filtration rate that was just below 60 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【74】Starting dose is a risk factor for allopurinol hypersensitivity syndrome: a proposed safe starting dose of allopurinol.\n\n【75】To evaluate our patient’s current episode of left knee pain, she underwent diagnostic arthrocentesis. An ultrasound exam of the left knee was performed before the procedure.\n\n【76】*   5.\n\n【77】    **Which of the following ultrasound findings is _most specific_ for gout _in this patient_ ?**\n\n【78】    *   a.\n\n【79】        Double contour sign\n\n【80】    *   b.\n\n【81】        Synovitis\n\n【82】    *   c.\n\n【83】        Joint effusion\n\n【84】    *   d.\n\n【85】        Bone proliferation\n\n【86】    *   e.\n\n【87】        Juxta-articular erosion\n\n【88】The “double contour sign” is considered a highly specific ultrasound finding for gout, defined as an abnormal hyperechoic band over the superficial margin of the articular hyaline cartilage, independent of the angle of insonation, and which may be irregular or regular, continuous, or intermittent and can be distinguished from the cartilage interface sign. In a large international multicenter study, the presence of the double contour sign was 91.4% specific and had an 87.7% positive predictive value with a 69.3% negative predictive value.\n\n【89】Performance of ultrasound in the diagnosis of gout in a multicenter study: comparison with monosodium urate monohydrate crystal analysis as the gold standard.\n\n【90】In contrast, synovitis, edema within the synovium, and increased flow on Doppler ultrasound are less specific findings typically associated with an inflammatory arthritis. Joint effusion, seen on ultrasound by observing fluid in the joint space that is pushed away when compression is applied, and bone proliferation are nonspecific findings seen in a variety of arthropathies, both inflammatory and non-inflammatory. “Rat bite” or juxta-articular erosions are frequently seen in gout, though this is typically a radiographic as opposed to sonographic finding.\n\n【91】The patient’s left knee ultrasound showed no knee intra-articular effusion, minimal synovitis, and no double contour sign. No fluid could be aspirated from the joint. During the ultrasound exam there was significant point tenderness just above the patella. Images of the left quadriceps tendon/patellar enthesis (the site of attachment of the tendon to bone) showed hyperechoic crystalline deposits. Power Doppler of the same area showed extensive hyperemia. Ultrasound findings were consistent with uric acid deposition and acute inflammation of the quadriceps tendon/patellar enthesis.\n\n【92】Based on the ultrasound findings and the clinical presentation, our patient was diagnosed with gout enthesitis. Gout enthesitis could be treated with systemic glucocorticoids or NSAIDs. However, given this patient’s cardiomyopathy and frequent heart failure episodes, an ultrasound-guided peri-tendinous glucocorticoid injection was performed. Ultrasound guidance is important as inadvertent intratendinous injection could increase the risk of rupture. It is our experience that intra-articular glucocorticoid injection does not relieve symptoms of quadriceps enthesitis. Were ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection not available, use of oral dexamethasone could have been considered, as this steroid has minimal mineralocorticoid activity and thus fewer issues with volume retention.\n\n【93】Following the ultrasound-guided injection of methylprednisolone and lidocaine around the site of the quadriceps enthesis, our patient experienced immediate relief (lidocaine effect) and could fully flex her knee without pain. She continued to enjoy sustained relief of her knee pain at a visit 2 weeks later and has experienced no further episodes.\n\n【94】Discussion\n----------\n\n【95】Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in the United States with a prevalence of 1% to 4% in the adult population (1% to 2% in women, 3% to 6% in men).\n\n【96】Deposition of MSU crystals in the tissues, especially the joints and peri-articular tissues, can cause an acute inflammatory response. While hyperuricemia must be present for MSU crystals to form, uric acid levels fluctuate and are often normal during gouty attacks. When gout is suspected, synovial fluid or tophi aspirate should be obtained and studied for crystals. When this is not possible, the American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria provide an approach to diagnosis, although these are not diagnostic criteria but rather guidelines that are primarily intended for facilitating enrollment in studies.\n\n【97】2015 Gout classification criteria: an American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism collaborative initiative.\n\n【98】Without treatment, chronic tophaceous gout may develop, with extensive joint destruction and deformity.\n\n【99】Our patient developed gout enthesitis, which is one of the known extra-articular manifestations of gout. In individuals with gout, urate deposition can be seen in a variety of locations within the soft tissue of the musculoskeletal system, including the tendons, ligaments, bursae, and entheses.\n\n【100】Enthesitis is often difficult to diagnose because pain at entheseal sites often presents as arthralgia, and swelling is typically absent.\n\n【101】Enthesitis: from pathophysiology to treatment.\n\n【102】Awareness of this condition, especially in patients in whom gout flares are suspected but seemingly unresponsive to intra-articular steroid injection, can substantially improve management.\n\n【103】Once suspected, diagnosis of gout enthesitis is either based on clinical findings or may be assisted by imaging, particularly ultrasound or DECT.\n\n【104】Dual energy CT for the diagnosis of gout: an accuracy and diagnostic yield study.\n\n【105】Although there are clinical guidelines to direct treatment of gout arthropathy, there are no such guidelines for gout enthesitis; thus, treatment of this condition is typically based on recommendations for gout arthropathy. Given that this is a relatively common but greatly underdiagnosed condition, it is hoped that with increased recognition and treatment, specific guidelines for extra-articular gout will be developed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Published recommendations are based on the expert opinion of a small number of authors without collaboration from multiple specialties. The Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) recognized the need for consensus recommendations in this area as well as the unique opportunity for its multidisciplinary membership to fill this void. In a series of articles within this journal, SPAQI provides preoperative medication management guidance based on available literature and expert multidisciplinary consensus. The aim of this consensus statement is to provide practical guidance on the preoperative management of gastrointestinal and pulmonary medications. A panel of experts with anesthesiology, perioperative medicine, hospital medicine, general internal medicine, and medical specialty experience was drawn together and identified the common medications in each of these categories. The authors then used a modified Delphi approach to review the literature and to generate consensus recommendations.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ACR/AAHKS ( American College of Rheumatology/American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons ), COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ), GLP-1 ( glucagon-like peptide 1 ), HBV ( hepatitis B virus ), HCV ( hepatitis C virus ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), 5-HT ( 5-hydroxytryptamine ), IBD ( inflammatory bowel disease ), IPF ( idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ), PDE ( phosphodiesterase ), PDE-5 ( phosphodiesterase type 5 ), PH ( pulmonary hypertension ), PPI ( proton pump inhibitor ), SPAQI ( Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement ), TNF ( tumor necrosis factor ), USFDA ( US Food and Drug Administration )\n\n【4】Medication management is key to optimizing the care of patients undergoing invasive procedures. Clinicians must ascertain whether a patient’s long-term medications may alter anesthetic or analgesic effects or increase surgery- or anesthesia-related bleeding risk. Common postoperative complications, including postoperative delirium and respiratory depression, may also be increased by some medications. However, inappropriate withholding of medications is equally important because of the risks associated with systemic disease and medication withdrawal syndromes. Further complicating management is the fact that surgery type must also be factored into decision-making. For some medications, outcomes with one type of surgery may be minimally affected, whereas complications are increased for another. Thus, close collaboration with proceduralists and specialists is imperative.\n\n【5】Continuous evolution of anesthetic and surgical practices and US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA)–approved therapies complicates the process of perioperative medication management. Coupled with a shortage of evidence-based resources, clinicians lack guidance for optimal practice. The Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) seeks to fill this practice gap by leveraging its specialized focus in the field of perioperative medicine.\n\n【6】SPAQI is an international, multidisciplinary society dedicated to the promotion of evidence-based perioperative medicine and has produced a number of recommendation papers and consensus statements in this field.\n\n【7】Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) Consensus Statement on Perioperative Smoking Cessation.\n\n【8】Preoperative management of opioid and nonopioid analgesics: Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) Consensus Statement.\n\n【9】Preoperative management of endocrine, hormonal, and urologic medications: Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) Consensus Statement.\n\n【10】SPAQI drafted a comprehensive plan for developing consensus recommendations for preoperative medication management using perioperative medicine, anesthesiology, internal medicine, hospital medicine, and medical subspecialty experts. This consensus statement contains the work of a subgroup focused on providing guidance on the preoperative management of gastrointestinal and pulmonary medications.\n\n【11】Methods\n-------\n\n【12】Subject matter for the SPAQI consensus statements was selected by SPAQI leadership on the basis of knowledge and practice gaps identified from discussions with the membership. Gastrointestinal and pulmonary medications were combined for this consensus group to balance the volume of information across the series of recommendation statements. Members of the consensus group were recognized experts in the fields of perioperative medicine, anesthesiology, general internal medicine, hospital medicine, and subspecialty internal medicine from several different academic institutions.\n\n【13】The group first identified common USFDA-approved medications for pulmonary and gastrointestinal disease. Medications and supplements without USFDA-approved indications were not included in our review. Using a modified Delphi methodology described in the first publication of SPAQI’s series of medication consensus statements, the group conducted consensus determination meetings and reviewed available literature.\n\n【14】Preoperative management of opioid and nonopioid analgesics: Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) Consensus Statement.\n\n【15】Literature reviews were independently conducted through PubMed queries with relevant search terms by at least 3 different members of the group and findings shared with the whole group for discussion. From this process, the group derived consensus recommendations using the following guiding principles:\n\n【16】Consensus was established for all reviewed medications, and the completed set of recommendations was reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of SPAQI. Described here are specific recommendations for each medication class.\n\n【17】Pulmonary Medications\n---------------------\n\n【18】Recommendations for the preoperative management of pulmonary medications are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【19】Table 1 Summary of Recommendations for the Preoperative Management of Pulmonary Medications\n\n| Medication class | Examples | Management before the morning of surgery | Management on the morning of surgery | Additional considerations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Anticholinergics, inhaled | Ipratropium, tiotropium, aclidinium, umeclidinium, revefenacin, glycopyrrolate | Continue | Continue | Same instructions if part of a combination inhaler |\n| Antifibrotic medications | Nintedanib, pirfenidone | Continue | Continue | Discuss perioperative management with prescribing clinician because of potential for inhibited wound healing |\n| Arylalkylamine decongestants | Phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine | Continue | Hold |  |\n| β 2 \\-Adrenergic agonists | Albuterol, metaproterenol, levalbuterol, salmeterol, formoterol, aformoterol, indacaterol, olodaterol, vilanterol | Continue | Continue | Same instructions if part of a combination inhaler |\n| Corticosteroids, inhaled | Fluticasone, budesonide, mometason, beclomethasone | Continue | Continue | Same instructions if part of a combination inhaler |\n| Endothelin receptor antagonists | Bosentan, macitentan, ambrisentan | Continue | Continue | •Potential for rebound PH with discontinuation•Can cause adverse effects of fluid retention, edema, anemia•Bosentan is a CYP3A4 inducer; concomitant use with opioids decreases opioid efficacy; may require higher opioid doses for pain control•Bosentan and macitentan have drug-drug interactions with erythromycin, clarithromycin, amiodarone, diltiazem, verapamil, itraconazole, fluconazole, and others that increase the plasma levels of the endothelin receptor antagonist•Preoperative studies: CBC (for all) and hepatic function tests (for bosentan and macitentan)•Coordinate perioperative care with prescribing clinician |\n| H 1 antihistamines | Hydroxyzine, dimenhydrinate, cetirizine, diphenhydramine, loratadine, levocetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine | Continue | Hold  | Hold first-generation antihistamines and cetirizine on the day of surgery because of their potential for contributing to postoperative delirium and anticholinergic adverse effects |\n| Leukotriene inhibitors | Montelukast, zafirlukast, zileuton | Continue | Continue | Concurrent use of zileuton and beta blockers may result in a significant increase in β-adrenergic blockade;

concurrent use with erythromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or -azole antifungals increases risk of hypotension, headache, and visual changes from PDE-5 inhibitors•Coordinate perioperative care with prescribing clinician |\n| Prostacyclin analogues | Epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost | Continue | Continue | •Dangerous to interrupt therapy because of rebound PH; ensure adequate preparation for continuous administration perioperatively•Increased risk of hemorrhagic complications due to antiplatelet effects, particularly when used concurrently with anticoagulants and other antiplatelet agents•Coordinate perioperative care with prescribing clinician |\n| Riociguat |  | Continue | Continue  | •Discuss potential for bleeding complications with the surgeon or proceduralist•Concurrent use with nitrates is contraindicated because of risk for significant hypotension•Concurrent use with clarithromycin or itraconazole increases riociguat levels and risk of hypotension•Coordinate perioperative care with prescribing clinician |\n| Selexipag |  | Continue | Continue | •Increased risk of hemorrhagic complications, particularly with concurrent use of other antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants•Preoperative studies: CBC•Coordinate perioperative care with prescribing clinician |\n| Theophylline |  | Continue | Hold | •Consider discussion of long-term necessity with the prescriber because of narrow therapeutic window, potential for drug interactions, and cardiac adverse effects•Concurrent use with ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, cimetidine, ranitidine, fluconazole, imipenem, or levofloxacin may result in theophylline toxicity (nausea, vomiting, palpitations, seizures)•Theophylline can decrease the effectiveness of benzodiazepines and pancuronium |\n\n【21】CBC, complete blood count; PDE-4, phosphodiesterase type 4; PDE-5, phosphodiesterase type 5; PH, pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【22】### Anticholinergic Medications\n\n【23】These inhaled medications work by blocking the ability of acetylcholine to bind to muscarinic receptors, in turn inhibiting bronchial constriction and mucus production. Specific drugs in this class include ipratropium, tiotropium, aclidinium, umeclidinium, revefenacin, and inhaled glycopyrrolate. Minimal literature about perioperative management of inhaled anticholinergics is available, but at least 2 studies found lower rates of pulmonary complications in patients using inhaled tiotropium (alone or in combination with formoterol and budesonide) preoperatively.\n\n【24】Inhaled tiotropium to prevent postoperative cardiopulmonary complications in patients with newly diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring lung cancer surgery.\n\n【25】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue inhaled anticholinergic medications up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【26】### β <sub>2 </sub> \\-Adrenergic Agonists\n\n【27】The β <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenergic agonists activate cyclic adenosine monophosphate, causing relaxation of smooth muscles and improved airway flow. Medications in this class include inhaled agents that are short-acting (albuterol, metaproterenol, and levalbuterol) and long-acting (salmeterol, formoterol, aformoterol, indacaterol, and olodaterol). There is no specific evidence of perioperative adverse events related to these medications, and in a randomized trial with patients undergoing esophagectomy, salmeterol started immediately before surgery was associated with a significant decrease in pneumonia incidence.\n\n【28】The beta agonist lung injury trial prevention. A randomized controlled trial.\n\n【29】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue inhaled β <sub>2 </sub> \\-adrenergic agonists up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【30】### Theophylline\n\n【31】Theophylline is an orally administered 3-methylxanthine presumed to induce airway smooth muscle relaxation through inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE). Inhibition of PDE type 3 accounts for most of its bronchodilator effects, although it may also have anti-inflammatory effects. Cardiac adverse effects, drug interactions, and a narrow therapeutic window have led to drastically decreased use. We could identify no relevant literature guiding its preoperative management, but the negative aspects causing its decline in general use also raise concern for its perioperative administration.\n\n【32】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue theophylline before the day of surgery but hold on the day of surgery because of its narrow therapeutic window, potential for drug interactions, and cardiac adverse effects. Consider discussion of long-term necessity with the prescriber.\n\n【33】### Roflumilast\n\n【34】This inhaled medication inhibits PDE type 4, leading to reduction of inflammatory mediators. It has been reported to increase lung function and to decrease exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in patients already using other guideline-directed therapies.\n\n【35】There is no specific literature on the perioperative management of roflumilast, but there are also no serious adverse effects to warrant interruption of this therapy that improves pulmonary function.\n\n【36】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue roflumilast up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【37】### Inhaled Corticosteroids\n\n【38】Inhaled corticosteroids decrease airway inflammation and hyperreactivity and are a cornerstone for treatment of obstructive lung disease. Oral steroids cause many undesirable adverse effects, including adrenal suppression, bone demineralization, and immunosuppression, but the systemic impact of inhaled corticosteroids remains relatively low except when they are used at the highest dosages.\n\n【39】Specifically, there is no evidence of perioperative harm from use of inhaled corticosteroids, and some evidence suggests benefit from preoperative use.\n\n【40】The relationship between perioperative administration of inhaled corticosteroid and postoperative respiratory complications after pulmonary resection for non-small-cell lung cancer in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\n【41】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue inhaled corticosteroids up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【42】### Combination Inhaled Medications\n\n【43】Multiple USFDA combinations of inhaled corticosteroids, long-acting β <sub>2 </sub> agonists, and anticholinergics are available for treatment of asthma and COPD. Literature specific to these products is included in the preceding sections.\n\n【44】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue combination inhaled medications up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【45】### Leukotriene Inhibitors\n\n【46】Montelukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton are oral asthma medications that exert their therapeutic effect by blocking leukotriene-mediated inflammation. There is no specific literature about the perioperative use of these medications, but their adverse effect profile does not include elements that would preclude their use before surgery.\n\n【47】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue leukotriene inhibitors up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【48】### _N_ \\-Acetylcysteine\n\n【49】_N_ \\-Acetylcysteine is used for some patients with COPD to thin respiratory secretions and potentially to reduce the frequency of exacerbations. Given its relatively low incidence of serious adverse effects and the lack of literature about its perioperative use, continuation of therapy through surgery is appropriate.\n\n【50】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue _N_ \\-acetylcysteine up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【51】### H <sub>1 </sub> Antihistamines\n\n【52】Medications from this class include both first-generation H <sub>1 </sub> antihistamines and second-generation H <sub>1 </sub> antihistamines (cetirizine, levocetirizine, fexofenadine, desloratadine, and loratadine); they are used for several purposes, such as allergic rhinosinusitis, atopic dermatitis, insomnia, and anxiety. First-generation H <sub>1 </sub> antihistamines penetrate the blood-brain barrier (which may cause somnolence) and also have anticholinergic adverse effects. For these reasons, their use is discouraged in elderly patients in all situations but particularly around surgery because they may contribute to perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction.\n\n【53】Second-generation H <sub>1 </sub> antihistamines do not have anticholinergic effects and, with the exception of cetirizine, do not have central nervous system penetrance.\n\n【54】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue antihistamines before the day of surgery but hold first-generation antihistamines and cetirizine on the day of surgery because of their potential for contributing to postoperative delirium and anticholinergic adverse effects.\n\n【55】### Arylalkylamine Decongestants\n\n【56】These medications, including phenylephrine and pseudoephedrine, are available over-the-counter remedies for symptomatic relief of rhinitis. Decongestants are sympathomimetic, and a major adverse effect is elevated blood pressure. No perioperative studies of these medications are available, but given their noncritical use and their potential cardiovascular effects, withholding immediately before surgery is warranted.\n\n【57】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue arylalkylamine decongestants before the day of surgery but hold on the day of surgery because of their potential for contributing to cardiovascular adverse effects.\n\n【58】### Medications for Pulmonary Hypertension\n\n【59】Patients who require medication treatment for pulmonary hypertension (PH; primarily group 1 PH, pulmonary arterial hypertension) have substantial and unique perioperative risks requiring specialized knowledge and expertise. For all such patients, preoperative optimization must include collaboration with anesthesia providers and the patient’s PH specialist and assurance that the procedure is being performed in a facility with appropriate experience and resources for managing PH.\n\n【60】2014 ACC/AHA guideline on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and management of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.\n\n【61】The following recommendations are for general guidance and should not replace consultation with PH specialists and anesthesiologists.\n\n【62】#### Prostacyclin Analogues\n\n【63】Medications in this class include epoprostenol, treprostinil, and iloprost and produce pulmonary vasodilation through stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Epoprostenol is given intravenously and has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes. Iloprost also has a short half-life (∼30 minutes) and can be given intravenously or inhaled. Treprostinil has a half-life of approximately 4 hours and can be given orally, intravenously, inhaled, or subcutaneously. Uninterrupted continuation of these medications is critical because not doing so can lead to acute right-sided heart failure and death.\n\n【64】Given the potential cardiovascular risks and special considerations for equipment and training for managing these medications, we advise consulting with the anesthesiology service as far in advance of surgery as possible, especially if the patient is on a continuous infusion.\n\n【65】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue prostacyclin analogues up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【66】#### Selexipag\n\n【67】Selexipag is a selective prostacyclin receptor agonist that is administered orally and is long-acting (half-life of ∼6 to 12 hours). Its mechanism of action and adverse effect profile are similar to those of prostacyclin analogues. Although selexipag’s longer half-life leads to less risk for sudden cardiovascular decompensation with withdrawal of the drug, its importance in managing PH necessitates its perioperative continuation.\n\n【68】Temporary treatment interruptions with oral selexipag in pulmonary arterial hypertension: Insights from the Prostacyclin (PGI <sub>2 </sub> ) Receptor Agonist in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (GRIPHON) study.\n\n【69】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue selexipag up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【70】#### Endothelin Receptor Antagonists\n\n【71】Endothelin 1 is a polypeptide responsible for potent and long-lasting vasoconstriction, and its effects are mediated through 2 receptors, endothelin A and endothelin B. Medications in this class, including bosentan, macitentan, and ambrisentan, are orally administered. Macitentan and bosentan are antagonists for both endothelin A and endothelin B, whereas ambrisentan is an endothelin A–selective antagonist. There is a paucity of data on perioperative management of these medications, but their continuation is advised, given their importance in the management of PH.\n\n【72】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue endothelin receptor antagonists up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【73】#### Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE-5) Inhibitors\n\n【74】Sildenafil and tadalafil are medications in this class used for PH. These medications lead to direct myocardial effects through cyclic guanosine monophosphate and cyclic adenosine monophosphate activation that may counterbalance hypertrophic and proapoptotic signaling, including adrenergic stimulation.\n\n【75】Minimal data on perioperative management of PDE-5 inhibitors for PH are available. They are less likely than prostacyclin analogues to cause a pulmonary hypertensive crisis with interruption, but they should be continued because of the importance of adequately treated PH.\n\n【76】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue PDE-5 inhibitors up to and including the day of surgery when used for treatment of PH. Perioperative management of PDE-5 inhibitors prescribed for urologic indications is detailed in another publication within this consensus statement series.\n\n【77】Preoperative management of endocrine, hormonal, and urologic medications: Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) Consensus Statement.\n\n【78】#### Riociguat\n\n【79】Riociguat is an oral PH medication that works by stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase, which induces vasodilation in vascular smooth muscle and assists in reducing elevated pulmonary pressure. It is the only PH medication that is USFDA approved for treatment of group 4 PH (due to chronic thromboembolic disease). At grossly supratherapeutic doses, riociguat inhibits platelet function, and nonsurgical bleeding complications have been described with this drug.\n\n【80】The sGC stimulator riociguat inhibits platelet function in washed platelets but not in whole blood.\n\n【81】We identified no specific perioperative literature for riociguat. Because this medication is not associated with a severe withdrawal syndrome, interruption could be considered in select cases when surgical bleeding risk is particularly high.\n\n【82】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue riociguat up to and including the day of surgery, but discuss potential for bleeding complications with the surgeon or proceduralist.\n\n【83】### Antifibrotic Medications\n\n【84】As of publication of this manuscript, 2 medications are USFDA approved for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF): nintedanib and pirfenidone. Pirfenidone reduces fibroblast proliferation and inhibits collagen formation. Nintedanib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that impedes pulmonary fibrosis and has been found to improve quality of life and lung function in patients with IPF and other progressive pulmonary fibrosis conditions. Pirfenidone may cause hepatotoxic effects and is metabolized through CYP1A2, which could lead to toxicity of medications affecting this enzymatic pathway (eg, fluconazole, ciprofloxacin, paroxetine). Nintedanib is associated with increased risk of arterial thromboembolism, hepatotoxicity, and bleeding. Given their antifibrotic properties, concerns of impaired wound healing have been raised. Although one recent case report described wound dehiscence associated with nintedanib use after cardiac surgery, other literature found no apparent increased wound complications and fewer than expected IPF exacerbations in lung transplant patients receiving nintedanib and pirfenidone.\n\n【85】Risk of anastomotic dehiscence in patients with pulmonary fibrosis transplanted while receiving anti-fibrotics: experience of the Australian Lung Transplant Collaborative.\n\n【86】A phase 2 trial of perioperative administration of pirfenidone to surgical patients with lung cancer also found no apparent increase in wound or bleeding complications but decreased acute exacerbations of IPF.\n\n【87】A phase II trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of perioperative pirfenidone for prevention of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in lung cancer patients undergoing pulmonary resection: West Japan Oncology Group 6711 L (PEOPLE Study).\n\n【88】Given these potential perioperative benefits, continuing these medications uninterrupted through other types of surgery is worth discussing with patients’ surgeons and specialty clinicians.\n\n【89】_Consensus Recommendations_ : Continue nintedanib and pirfenidone up to and including the day of surgery, but discuss perioperative management with the surgeon and prescribing clinician.\n\n【90】Gastrointestinal Medications\n----------------------------\n\n【91】Recommendations for the preoperative management of gastrointestinal medications are summarized in Table 2 .\n\n【92】Table 2 Summary of Recommendations for the Preoperative Management of Gastrointestinal Medications\n\n| Medication class | Examples | Management before the morning of surgery | Management on the morning of surgery | Additional considerations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 5-Aminosalicylic acid | Mesalamine, balsalazide, olsalazine, sulfasalazine | Continue | Continue | •Consider holding on the morning of surgery if GFR <50 mL/min•Preoperative studies: CBC and creatinine |\n| 5-HT 3 antagonists | Ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, palonosetron | Continue | Continue | •Prolong QT interval•Caution with concurrent use with other serotoninergic drugs; can increase risk of serotonin syndrome |\n| Antacids | Sodium citrate, magnesium trisilicate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, sucralfate | Continue | Hold | Nonparticulate antacids (sodium citrate and magnesium trisilicate) may be acceptable to take on the morning of surgery for patients at increased risk for pulmonary aspiration |\n| Anticholinergics or antispasmodics | Dicyclomine, hyoscyamine | Continue | Hold | Reexamine the long-term necessity of these medications (especially in elderly patients); if absolutely needed for airway secretion control that could affect airway management, continuation of these agents is reasonable |\n| Antidiarrheals | Loperamide, diphenoxylate, atropine | Continue | Hold |  |\n| Anti-HBV reverse transcriptase inhibitors | Entecavir, tenofovir, lamivudine, adefovir | Continue | Continue | •Consult with the prescribing clinician•Preoperative studies: creatinine and hepatic function studies |\n| Aprepitant |  | Continue | Continue | •Concomitant use with hormonal contraceptives may decrease efficacy during therapy and for 28 days after therapy•Concurrent use with opioids or midazolam can increase risk of respiratory depression and opioid toxicity |\n| Bupropion/naltrexone |  | Hold for 72 hours before surgery | Hold | If procedure will not require opioid use, may be reasonable to continue uninterrupted |\n| Dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir |  | Continue | Hold | Discuss management with prescribing clinician |\n| Dopamine antagonist antiemetics | Promethazine, prochlorperazine, droperidol, metoclopramide | Continue | Continue | •Multiple drug-drug interactions•Use with caution in patients with QT prolongation; avoid concurrent use with other QT-prolonging medications•Caution with concurrent use of central nervous system depressant medications because of increased risk of respiratory depression•Avoid use in patients with COPD and sleep apnea because of increased risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression•Avoid use in patients with Parkinson disease and in elderly with increased risk of delirium because of significant anticholinergic effects•Preoperative studies: ECG |\n| Elbasvir/grazoprevir |  | Continue | Hold | Discuss management with prescribing clinician |\n| Gallstone solubilizing agents | Ursodiol, chenodeoxycholic acid | Continue | Hold |  |\n| Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir |  | Continue | Hold | Discuss management with prescribing clinician |\n| Guanylate cyclase C agonists | Linaclotide, plecanatide | Continue | Continue |  |\n| H 2 antagonists | Ranitidine, famotidine | Continue | Continue | •H 2 antagonists may induce or worsen delirium in elderly patients•Famotidine increases QT interval; concurrent use with other medications that also prolong QT increases risk of arrhythmias•Cimetidine is associated with multiple drug interactions, causing increased toxicity and adverse effects of several beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, benzodiazepines, warfarin, lidocaine, tramadol, morphine, and oxymorphone•Concurrent use of cimetidine (CYP2D6 inhibitor) with tramadol increases plasma concentrations of tramadol (increased seizures, serotonin syndrome) and decreases levels of the active metabolite M1 (reduced efficacy for pain control) |\n| Laxatives | Sennosides, PEG 3350, bisacodyl, magnesium citrate/hydroxide, lactulose, docusate sodium | Continue | Hold |  |\n| Ledipasvir/sofosbuvir |  | Continue | Continue | •Discuss with gastroenterologist whether it is optimal to delay surgery until completion of therapy•Coadministration with amiodarone can result in significant bradycardia |\n| Liraglutide |  | Continue  | Hold | Before day of surgery: For gastrointestinal surgery or when there is concern for nausea, vomiting, or gut dysfunction, consider holding weekly dose within 7 days before surgeryDay of surgery: If weekly dose is due on morning of surgery, delay until later in day after surgery is complete |\n| Lisdexamfetamine |  | Hold for 72 hours before surgery | Hold | For patients at high risk for relapse of binge eating disorder, may continue before surgery and hold only on morning of surgery, but this requires discussion with the prescriber and anesthesiologist |\n| Lubiprostone |  | Continue | Continue |  |\n| Orlistat |  | Continue | Hold |  |\n| Pancreatic enzymes | Pancrelipase | Continue | Hold |  |\n| Pegylated interferons | Pegylated interferon alfa-2a, pegylated interferon alfa-2b | When used for treatment of viral hepatitis, stop interferons 1-2 weeks before surgery because of potential for perioperative complications | Hold | •Consult with the prescribing clinician•Preoperative studies: CBC, basic metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, hepatic function studies, ECG |\n| Phentermine |  | Hold for at least 4 days before surgery | Hold |  |\n| Phentermine/topiramate |  | Hold for at least 4 days before surgery  | Hold | •Either wean the patient off during the course of a week before surgery (according to product insert) or, while withholding, provide topiramate alone at the same dose•Preoperative studies: bicarbonate, potassium, creatinine, and glucose |\n| Proton pump inhibitors | Pantoprazole, omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, dexlansoprazole | Continue | Continue |  |\n| Ribavirin |  | Continue | Hold | Preoperative studies: CBC |\n| Serotonergic neuroenteric modulators | Tegaserod, alosetron, prucalopride | Continue | Continue |  |\n| Sofosbuvir |  | Continue | Continue | •Discuss with patient’s gastroenterology clinician whether it is optimal to delay surgery until completion of therapy•Coadministration with amiodarone can result in significant bradycardia |\n| Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir |  | Continue | Hold | Discuss management with prescribing clinician |\n| Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir |  | Continue | Hold | Discuss management with prescribing clinician |\n\n【94】CBC, complete blood count; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ECG, electrocardiogram; GFR, glomerular filtration rate; HBV, hepatitis B virus; PEG, polyethylene glycol; 5-HT <sub>3 </sub> , 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3.\n\n【95】### Proton Pump Inhibitors\n\n【96】Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) block gastric acid production by inhibiting the hydrogen-potassium ATPase pump on the parietal cell membrane. They are used for treating gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer disease, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug–related ulcerations, and _Helicobacter pylori_ infection.\n\n【97】Despite limited data to support the practice, gastric acid suppression is often used as a means of preventing anesthesia-related aspiration.\n\n【98】However, the American Society of Anesthesiologists does not recommend routinely providing pharmacologic blockade of gastric acid secretion for this purpose.\n\n【99】Complications of PPIs not specifically studied in the surgical setting but consequential to the perioperative setting include hypomagnesemia leading to increased arrhythmogenic potential and iron and vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> malabsorption leading to anemia. Because PPIs are extensively metabolized through CYP450, important drug-drug interactions with medications such as warfarin, benzodiazepines, and many others increase the risk of toxicity or decrease the efficacy of these drugs. The PPIs also decrease the antiplatelet efficacy of clopidogrel.\n\n【100】Whereas these effects are important considerations, there are no data suggesting specific perioperative risks, and the potential benefits of continuation include prevention of peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal disease, which can be serious postoperative complications.\n\n【101】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue PPIs up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【102】### H <sub>2 </sub> Receptor Antagonists\n\n【103】H <sub>2 </sub> receptor antagonists block acid secretion on the gastric parietal cell surface. This class of drugs is thought to be safe overall perioperatively. However, early literature in cardiac surgery suggested no benefit in raising gastric pH and possible stomach colonization associated with a trend toward increased nosocomial pneumonia.\n\n【104】Should we inhibit gastric acid secretion before cardiac surgery?\n\n【105】Furthermore, some authors have postulated a risk of possible central nervous system effects and postoperative delirium on the basis of limited data.\n\n【106】These medications are metabolized by cytochrome P450 pathways and therefore can cause drug interactions. Famotidine has been reported to prolong QT interval and can increase the risk of arrhythmias when it is used with other drugs that also prolong QT.\n\n【107】Ranitidine was pulled from the market by the USFDA in April 2020 because of concerns about a contaminant, _N_ \\-nitrosodimethylamine, identified in some ranitidine products that were stored at higher than room temperatures over time.\n\n【108】The H <sub>2 </sub> blockers are renally excreted and require a dose reduction or longer dosing interval if the creatinine clearance drops below 50 mL/min. Rapid infusion of these agents can cause cardiac effects including bradycardia, heart block, and QT prolongation, but this is rare. Similar to PPIs, these potential adverse effects are important; but for patients who tolerate these therapies long term without problems, perioperative continuation is reasonable to maintain treatment of gastrointestinal disease that could cause postoperative complications if it is inadequately treated.\n\n【109】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue H <sub>2 </sub> receptor antagonists up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【110】### Antacids\n\n【111】Antacid formulations are commonly composed of sodium citrate, magnesium trisilicate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, or sucralfate. They neutralize gastric acid directly and diminish acid delivery to the duodenum. The American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends against routine preoperative use of antacids and strongly recommends against the use of particulate antacids (aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, or sucralfate), which are associated with a higher risk and severity of aspiration events.\n\n【112】For patients at increased risk for pulmonary aspiration, nonparticulate antacids (sodium citrate and magnesium trisilicate) may be considered for their potential to reduce aspiration-related complications.\n\n【113】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue antacids up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery. Nonparticulate antacids may be acceptable to take on the morning of surgery for patients at increased risk for pulmonary aspiration.\n\n【114】### Antiemetics\n\n【115】#### 5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor 3 (5-HT <sub>3 </sub> ) Antagonists\n\n【116】These agents are commonly used for control of nausea and vomiting in the perioperative period and in cancer patients and exert their effect by antagonizing 5-HT <sub>3 </sub> receptors centrally in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Four 5-HT <sub>3 </sub> antagonists are approved by the FDA; they are ondansetron, granisetron, dolasetron, and palonosetron. These medications are well tolerated with few adverse effects. However, caution is advised when these medications are used concurrently with medications that prolong QT interval (torsades de pointes) or have serotonergic properties (serotonin syndrome).\n\n【117】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue 5-HT <sub>3 </sub> antagonists up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【118】#### Dopamine Antagonists\n\n【119】Promethazine, prochlorperazine, droperidol, and metoclopramide are centrally acting dopamine antagonists that are effective for treatment of nausea and vomiting in multiple settings. Metoclopramide is also used as a gastrointestinal stimulant to improve gastric emptying and bowel motility. Available data suggest that these medications are safe in the perioperative period; however, their antidopaminergic effect may lead to extrapyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and tardive dyskinesia (with prolonged therapy), and they can prolong the QT interval. These drugs have multiple drug-drug interactions with many medications; it may be beneficial to consult with a pharmacist if these medications are prescribed throughout the postoperative period.\n\n【120】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue dopamine antagonists up to and including the day of surgery, unless there are concerns of significant QT prolongation.\n\n【121】#### Aprepitant\n\n【122】Aprepitant is a neurokinin 1 antagonist that is a highly effective and costly oral antiemetic. It is well tolerated and has been found to be safe and effective in the perioperative setting.\n\n【123】Perioperative administration of Emend (aprepitant) at a tertiary care children's hospital: a 12-month survey.\n\n【124】Concurrent use of aprepitant with opioids, midazolam, alprazolam, or triazolam can increase risk of respiratory depression and opioid toxicity, but this is less of a concern if a single dose is used. It has also been reported to decrease the efficacy of oral contraceptive medications for up to 28 days; it is important to mention to women that an alternative form of contraception should be used for 1 month after the last dose of aprepitant. Aprepitant is a substrate, inhibitor, and inducer of CYP3A4 and an inducer of CYP2C9, so there are drug-drug interactions to be aware of if this medication is used consistently.\n\n【125】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue aprepitant up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【126】### Hepatitis B and C Antivirals\n\n【127】For all patients undergoing therapy for eradication or suppression of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), the preoperative care clinician should discuss perioperative management with patients’ gastroenterology clinicians. Specifically, it should be determined whether a patient’s liver disease is sufficiently optimized to tolerate surgery and whether a nonurgent procedure should be delayed to allow the completion of eradication therapy.\n\n【128】#### Anti-HBV Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors\n\n【129】Entecavir, tenofovir, and lamivudine are used in the treatment of chronic HBV infection as well as HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection. Entecavir and lamivudine are nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; tenofovir is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Adefovir is another nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is rarely used and effective only for chronic HBV infection. All these mediations inhibit HBV replication but do not completely eliminate the virus; thus, these agents are usually taken indefinitely. All are also associated with potential nephrotoxicity, which should be taken into consideration for patients with alterations in renal function. Although HBV recurrence from brief withholding is unlikely, no specific perioperative adverse effects have been identified that would suggest a need to stop these medications. Some evidence suggests benefit from preoperative use of entecavir in patients undergoing HBV-associated hepatocellular carcinoma resection.\n\n【130】Perioperative antiviral therapy improves safety in patients with hepatitis B related HCC following hepatectomy.\n\n【131】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue entecavir, tenofovir, lamivudine, and adefovir up to and including the day of surgery but consult with the prescribing clinician. Assess renal and hepatic function before surgery because of nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity of these agents.\n\n【132】#### Pegylated Interferons\n\n【133】Pegylated interferon alfa-2a is a rarely used monotherapy for hepatitis B. Pegylated interferon alfa-2a and pegylated interferon alfa-2b may be used in combination with oral antivirals for treatment of hepatitis C. The antiviral mechanisms of interferons are immunoregulatory and complex. Unlike oral antivirals, these subcutaneous medications are administered for a defined time (24 to 48 weeks) and have the advantage of long-term sustained virologic response (20% to 30% for HBV and 40% to 60% for HCV). The potential adverse effects of interferons are well documented and common; they include immunologic, hematologic, metabolic, neuropsychiatric, and pulmonary complications. Because of these adverse effects and the efficacy of oral therapies, interferons are rarely used in the treatment of viral hepatitis. Perioperative safety data are lacking, but these drugs have metabolism interactions with opioids and lidocaine that raise concerns for their perioperative use. Based on their adverse effect profile, withholding of anti-HBV or anti-HCV interferon therapy before surgery would appear prudent. Because use of interferons for hepatitis treatment is unusual, decision-making for perioperative interferon management should be discussed in detail with the gastroenterology team.\n\n【134】_Consensus Recommendations_ : When interferons are used for treatment of viral hepatitis, stop them 1 to 2 weeks before surgery because of potential for perioperative complications but consult with the prescribing clinician.\n\n【135】#### Ribavirin\n\n【136】Ribavirin is an oral RNA nucleoside inhibitor and inhibits RNA functions required for viral replication. The drug is used in conjunction with pegylated interferons or other oral antivirals for the treatment of HCV infection, including coinfection with HIV and HBV. Ribavirin has multiple potentially serious adverse effects, including anemia and cardiovascular disease (hypertension and myocardial infarction). No evidence-based guidelines or literature are available for perioperative management. Because most adverse effects are chronic, it is reasonable to continue ribavirin up to the day of surgery, but it should be held on the morning of surgery because of the need to take it with food.\n\n【137】_Consensus Recommendations_ : Continue ribavirin up to the day of surgery but hold on the morning of surgery. If hemoglobin level has not recently been obtained, check it before surgery.\n\n【138】#### Other Oral Anti-HCV Medications\n\n【139】Several other oral anti-HCV medications have greater efficacy in achieving sustained virologic response and are used much more frequently than the aforementioned drugs. These include sofosbuvir, ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/valpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir. Except for ritonavir, all these medications and their component drugs interfere with HCV viral RNA replication. Ritonavir is an HIV antiviral with no direct activity against HCV but is part of a combination with paritaprevir because it is a pharmacokinetic enhancer of that drug.\n\n【140】These medications are much better tolerated than interferons but still have important considerations. Sofosbuvir has several significant drug interactions, including amiodarone, PPIs, HIV antivirals, anticonvulsants, and antimycobacterials. Because of their cytochrome P450 metabolism, the other drugs in this group also have potential drug interactions with common perioperative medications. Elbasvir/grazoprevir, in particular, has several critical drug interactions, including opioids, antibiotics, benzodiazepines, and antiemetics. Glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir must also be taken with food. Data on the safety of these drugs in the perioperative setting are minimal, and management recommendations are based on the adverse effects, drug interactions, and administration requirements.\n\n【141】_Consensus Recommendations_ : Continue sofosbuvir and ledipasvir/sofosbuvir up to and including the day of surgery. Continue sofosbuvir/valpatasvir, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir, dasabuvir/ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, elbasvir/grazoprevir, and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir up to the day of surgery but hold on the morning of surgery. Discuss management with the patient’s gastroenterology clinician.\n\n【142】### Gallstone Solubilizing Agents\n\n【143】Ursodiol and chenodeoxycholic acid reduce gallstone formation after bariatric surgery and improve cholestasis in primary sclerosing cholangitis. No substantial perioperative literature is available for this class of medications, but when taken without food, they may cause nausea. For this reason and because their benefits are derived from long-term rather than short-term administration, withholding these medications while fasting is reasonable.\n\n【144】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue gallstone solubilizing agents up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery.\n\n【145】### Pancreatic Enzymes\n\n【146】These agents are commonly used for patients with pancreatic insufficiency related to inflammation, trauma, or surgical resection. Essentially no data are available on perioperative management of these medications. They are considered safe perioperatively, although during preoperative fasting, they should be held because they are usually not necessary in this situation.\n\n【147】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue pancreatic enzymes up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery.\n\n【148】### 5-Aminosalicylic Acid\n\n【149】Drugs in the 5-aminosalicylic acid class are used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Many clinicians have concerns about the potential for bleeding risk due to platelet inhibition, but these agents are considered safe in the perioperative period because they have a primarily luminal impact with minimal systemic effects. A narrative review from 2011 recommended stopping 1 day in advance and resuming 3 days postoperatively in the setting of impaired glomerular filtration; however, in the setting of normal renal function, this is not necessary.\n\n【150】Adverse effects include hypersensitivity reactions, bone marrow suppression, pneumonitis, pancreatitis, and hemolytic anemia, but these are rare.\n\n【151】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue 5-aminosalicylic acid medications up to and including the day of surgery but consider holding on the morning of surgery if glomerular filtration rate is below 50 mL/min.\n\n【152】### Antidiarrheals\n\n【153】Symptomatic management of diarrhea is accomplished by antimotility agents that work through either opioid receptor agonism or anticholinergic activity. Antidiarrheals are generally safe, although loperamide in excessive doses leads to euphoria, cardiotoxicity, and central nervous system and respiratory depression. Atropine has anticholinergic effects and may lead to anesthetic interactions, and a systematic review recommended loperamide and diphenoxylate/atropine conditionally in critically ill patients.\n\n【154】Antimotility agents for the treatment of acute noninfectious diarrhea in critically ill patients: a practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma.\n\n【155】It is appropriate to continue these agents preoperatively up to the day before surgery because the quality of life benefit outweighs the perioperative risks, given the short half-life of these agents.\n\n【156】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue antidiarrheals up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery because of the risk of opioid agonism and anticholinergic effects.\n\n【157】### Anticholinergics and Antispasmodics\n\n【158】Like antidiarrheal agents, these medications serve to slow gut transit time and reduce diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting as well as to control upper airway and gastric secretions. In the general setting, these medications have multiple adverse effects (tachyarrhythmias, hypertension, urinary retention, and altered mentation), and their use is discouraged in elderly patients.\n\n【159】A recent analysis found the use of these agents to be associated with multiple adverse postoperative outcomes, including decreased survival and increased length of stay, readmission, and costs of care.\n\n【160】These medications have strong potential for contributing to perioperative neurocognitive dysfunction, and the American Society of Anesthesiologists’ Brain Health Initiative recommends avoiding these agents in the surgical setting.\n\n【161】Best practices for postoperative brain health: recommendations from the Fifth International Perioperative Neurotoxicity Working Group.\n\n【162】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue anticholinergics and antispasmodics up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery. Reexamine the long-term necessity of these medications (especially in elderly patients). Continuation of these agents is reasonable if it is absolutely needed for airway secretion control that could affect airway management.\n\n【163】### Lubiprostone\n\n【164】Lubiprostone is used to activate the chloride channel on the apical membrane of the gastrointestinal tract to increase intestinal fluid secretion and to improve fecal transit. This medication is used to treat opioid-related constipation and other causes of chronic constipation. There is a paucity of perioperative literature for this medication.\n\n【165】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue lubiprostone up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【166】### Guanylate Cyclase C Agonists\n\n【167】This medication class includes linaclotide and plecanatide and is used treat chronic constipation by stimulating intestinal fluid secretion and transit. There is no significant perioperative literature for these medications, but they should be avoided in the setting of bowel obstruction or concerns for bowel perforation.\n\n【168】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue guanylate cyclase C agonists up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【169】### Peripheral Opioid Receptor Antagonists\n\n【170】SPAQI consensus recommendations for this class of medications have been published in a previous paper in this series, entitled “Preoperative Management of Opioid and Nonopioid Analgesics: Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) Consensus Statement.”\n\n【171】Preoperative management of opioid and nonopioid analgesics: Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) Consensus Statement.\n\n【172】### Serotonergic Neuroenteric Modulators\n\n【173】This class includes tegaserod, alosetron, and prucalopride; these agents are enteric 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists that stimulate peristalsis and intestinal secretions. These agents typically do not manifest systemic serotonergic activity as their action is primarily luminal.\n\n【174】Tegaserod for the Treatment of Irritable Bowel Syndrome.\n\n【175】Preoperative administration of prucalopride has been reported to reduce intestinal inflammation and to shorten the duration of postoperative ileus.\n\n【176】Preoperative administration of the 5-HT4 receptor agonist prucalopride reduces intestinal inflammation and shortens postoperative ileus via cholinergic enteric neurons.\n\n【177】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue serotonergic neuroenteric modulators up to and including the day of surgery.\n\n【178】### Laxatives\n\n【179】Laxatives, including bisacodyl, docusate, senna, and polyethylene glycol, may have multiple different mechanisms of action, but their primary goal is to help facilitate bowel movements in patients with constipation. There is no specific preoperative contraindication to the use of laxatives. However, clinicians may wish to avoid defecation risk in the operating room and the risk for gut motility disruption, especially before bowel surgery.\n\n【180】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue laxatives up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery.\n\n【181】### Immunomodulators\n\n【182】This broad category of agents is used for autoimmune diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, such as IBD, or for transplant-related immunosuppression. One must balance the risks of organ rejection or recrudescence of autoimmune disease with the risk of impaired wound healing and infection risk. Published literature on the perioperative management of these medications is conflicting and includes only small single-center studies.\n\n【183】_Consensus Recommendations:_ For patients taking these agents to prevent solid organ transplant rejection, continue up to and including the day of surgery. For other indications, management must be individualized on the basis of patient and surgical factors, and the risks and benefits of continuation must be discussed with the surgeon and prescribing clinician .\n\n【184】Table 3 Summary of Recommendations for the Preoperative Management of Gastrointestinal Immunomodulators\n\n| Medication class | Examples | Management before the morning of surgery | Management on the morning of surgery | Additional considerations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Purine analogues | 6-Mercaptopurine, azathioprine | Continue | Continue | Consult with prescribing clinician and surgeon |\n| Methotrexate |  | Continue | Continue | Consult with prescribing clinician and surgeon |\n| Tofacitinib |  | Withhold for 7 days before surgery | Hold | Consult with the prescribing clinician and surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption |\n| Ustekinumab |  | Withhold for at least 1 dosing interval before surgeryaThat is, if taken every 4 weeks, schedule surgery 5 weeks after the last dose. | Hold | Consult with the prescribing clinician and surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption |\n| Natalizumab |  | Withhold for at least 1 dosing interval before surgeryaThat is, if taken every 4 weeks, schedule surgery 5 weeks after the last dose. | Hold | Consult with the prescribing clinician and surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption |\n| Ozanimod |  | Withhold for at least 60 days before surgery | Hold | Consult with the prescribing clinician and surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption |\n| Vedolizumab |  | Withhold for at least 1 dosing interval before surgeryaThat is, if taken every 4 weeks, schedule surgery 5 weeks after the last dose. | Hold | Consult with the prescribing clinician and surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption; perioperative continuation may be reasonable for nonabdominal surgery |\n| Tumor necrosis factor inhibitors | Infliximab (and biosimilars), adalimumab (and biosimilars), golimumab and certolizumab | Withhold for at least 1 dosing interval before surgeryaThat is, if taken every 4 weeks, schedule surgery 5 weeks after the last dose. | Hold | Consult with the prescribing clinician and surgeon to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption | a That is, if taken every 4 weeks, schedule surgery 5 weeks after the last dose.\n\n【186】#### Purine Analogues\n\n【187】6-Mercaptopurine and azathioprine have not been found to significantly increase the risk of postoperative complications.\n\n【188】For patients undergoing arthroplasty, American College of Rheumatology/American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons (ACR/AAHKS) guidelines recommend continuing azathioprine uninterrupted through surgery for patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【189】2017 American College of Rheumatology/American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons guideline for the perioperative management of antirheumatic medication in patients with rheumatic diseases undergoing elective total hip or total knee arthroplasty.\n\n【190】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue purine analogues up to and including the day of surgery but consult with the surgeon and prescribing clinician.\n\n【191】#### Methotrexate\n\n【192】Methotrexate may be used in the treatment of IBD and other autoimmune conditions. Similar to the purine analogues, studies to date have not identified an association between preoperative methotrexate use and increased perioperative complications.\n\n【193】2017 American College of Rheumatology/American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons guideline for the perioperative management of antirheumatic medication in patients with rheumatic diseases undergoing elective total hip or total knee arthroplasty.\n\n【194】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Continue methotrexate up to and including the day of surgery but consult with the surgeon and prescribing clinician.\n\n【195】#### Tumor Necrosis Factor Inhibitors\n\n【196】These agents inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–induced inflammatory processes and are used for IBD and other rheumatologic conditions. Use of TNF inhibitors increases the risk of infection as well as of certain malignant neoplasms. However, interruption of therapy can also result in loss of efficacy due to antibody development. Published studies of their perioperative use have been highly heterogeneous and yielded conflicting results, but most data do not suggest an increased risk of postoperative complications, except in combination with other immunomodulators.\n\n【197】Biologics and 30-day postoperative complications after abdominal operations for Crohn's disease: are there differences in the safety profiles?\n\n【198】Furthermore, the PUCCINI trial’s preliminary results also suggest that continuing these agents does not increase infection risk.\n\n【199】However, until this study is published, it is problematic to advise routine perioperative continuation of these powerful immunosuppressants. In their guidelines for inflammatory arthritis and arthroplasty patients, the ACR/AAHKS advised not performing surgery for a full dosing cycle after the last administration.\n\n【200】2017 American College of Rheumatology/American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons guideline for the perioperative management of antirheumatic medication in patients with rheumatic diseases undergoing elective total hip or total knee arthroplasty.\n\n【201】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Withhold TNF inhibitors for at least 1 dosing interval before surgery (ie, if taken every 4 weeks, schedule surgery 5 weeks after the last dose) but consult with the surgeon and prescribing clinician to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption.\n\n【202】#### Other Biologic Immunomodulators\n\n【203】Ustekinumab, vedolizumab, and natalizumab are monoclonal antibodies used for the treatment of refractory IBD, but vedolizumab is unique for being gut specific. A retrospective single-center study with multivariate analysis of patients undergoing abdominal surgery found that increased postoperative infections were associated with biologic therapy only in combination with other immunosuppression.\n\n【204】Biologics and 30-day postoperative complications after abdominal operations for Crohn's disease: are there differences in the safety profiles?\n\n【205】In other studies, vedolizumab was not associated with increased risk for postoperative complications.\n\n【206】Vedolizumab and early postoperative complications in nonintestinal surgery: a case-matched analysis.\n\n【207】Risk of postoperative complications among inflammatory bowel disease patients treated preoperatively with vedolizumab.\n\n【208】Other specific perioperative data are limited, but the ACR/AAHKS guidelines provide recommendations to withhold ustekinumab for 1 dosing cycle before surgery.\n\n【209】2017 American College of Rheumatology/American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons guideline for the perioperative management of antirheumatic medication in patients with rheumatic diseases undergoing elective total hip or total knee arthroplasty.\n\n【210】Tofacitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of several autoimmune disorders, including ulcerative colitis that has failed to respond to treatment with TNF inhibitors. It is an oral medication with a much shorter half-life and is dosed twice daily. No specific literature has evaluated its safety in the surgical setting, but tofacitinib has a USFDA black box warning for increased risk of thrombosis that should be taken into consideration in the postoperative setting. The ACR/AAHKS guidelines recommend holding tofacitinib for 7 days before surgery.\n\n【211】2017 American College of Rheumatology/American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons guideline for the perioperative management of antirheumatic medication in patients with rheumatic diseases undergoing elective total hip or total knee arthroplasty.\n\n【212】Ozanimod is a selective modulator of sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors originally approved for treatment of multiple sclerosis but also approved in May 2021 as a once-daily oral medication for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Its therapeutic benefit is thought to be related to inhibited lymphocyte migration into the gastrointestinal tract, and use of ozanimod is associated with decreased blood lymphocyte counts. Ozanimod is also associated with increased risk of infections, bradyarrhythmias, and atrioventricular conduction delays, and its use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors is contraindicated because of potential for drug interactions. The mean half-life of active metabolites of ozanimod is approximately 11 days. No data on perioperative safety are available. On the basis of its immunosuppressant effects, we recommend discussion of perioperative management with the prescriber and surgeon and, if interruption of therapy is pursued, holding of ozanimod for 5 half-lives to ensure adequate clearance before surgery.\n\n【213】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Withhold vedolizumab, ustekinumab, and natalizumab for at least 1 dosing interval before surgery. Withhold ozanimod for 60 days and tofacitinib for 7 days before surgery but consult with the surgeon and prescribing clinician to discuss the relevant risks and benefits of therapy interruption. For vedolizumab, perioperative continuation may be reasonable for nonabdominal surgery.\n\n【214】### Weight Loss Medications\n\n【215】#### Phentermine\n\n【216】Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine with pharmacologic properties similar to the amphetamines. The mechanism of action in reducing appetite appears to be secondary to central nervous system effects, including stimulation of the hypothalamus to release norepinephrine. Available literature is somewhat variable, but most sources advise withholding before surgery because of the potential for cardiovascular adverse effects, the lack of evidence of serious withdrawal symptoms, and its use for a noncritical indication.\n\n【217】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Withhold phentermine for at least 4 days before surgery.\n\n【218】#### Lisdexamfetamine\n\n【219】This medication is used in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and binge eating disorder. It is a sympathomimetic amine that releases catecholamines from presynaptic nerve terminals and may block reuptake of catecholamines by competitive inhibition. Similar to phentermine, this medication has potential for cardiovascular adverse effects and is not associated with serious withdrawal symptoms. However, it has a shorter half-life than phentermine (12 hours vs 24 hours). There is an increased risk of serotonin syndrome when lisdexamfetamine is used concurrently with other serotoninergic drugs, many of which are used perioperatively, including fentanyl and its metabolites and tramadol.\n\n【220】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Withhold lisdexamfetamine for 72 hours before surgery if it is being taken for binge eating disorder. For patients at high risk for relapse of binge eating disorder, the medication may be continued before surgery and held only on the morning of surgery, but this requires discussion with the prescriber and anesthesiologist.\n\n【221】#### Phentermine/Topiramate\n\n【222】Phentermine is described earlier. Topiramate has appetite suppression and satiety enhancement by a variety of mechanisms, including blocking of neuronal voltage-dependent sodium channels, enhancement of γ-aminobutyric acid activity, antagonism of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainite glutamate receptors, and weak inhibition of carbonic anhydrase. Topiramate has anticonvulsant activity, and withdrawal of phentermine/topiramate is associated with increased risk for seizures as described in the product prescribing information.\n\n【223】Use of this medication combination can be associated with hypokalemia, hyperchloremic or non–anion gap metabolic acidosis, and increased creatinine concentration.\n\n【224】_Consensus Recommendations_ : Withhold phentermine/topiramate for at least 4 days before surgery. Either wean the patient off the medication during the course of a week before surgery (according to product insert) or, while withholding, provide topiramate alone at the same dose.\n\n【225】#### Orlistat\n\n【226】This agent is a reversible inhibitor of gastric and pancreatic lipases that inhibits absorption of dietary fats. As a result, it exerts its effect with food ingestion and thus has little purpose in the preoperative fasting state. There are no other known adverse effects of perioperative concern.\n\n【227】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Continue orlistat up to the day before surgery but hold on the morning of surgery.\n\n【228】#### Liraglutide\n\n【229】This treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus is a long-acting analogue of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) that slows gastric emptying and diminishes appetite. It is described in detail in a previously published article in this consensus statement series.\n\n【230】Preoperative management of endocrine, hormonal, and urologic medications: Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) Consensus Statement.\n\n【231】_Consensus Recommendations:_ Before the day of surgery, continue GLP-1 agonists unless there is heightened concern for postoperative nausea, vomiting, or gut dysfunction (eg, gastrointestinal surgery). In these situations, consider holding 24 hours for once- or twice-daily preparations and up to 1 week before surgery for weekly preparations (including holding dose within 7 days before surgery). Withhold GLP-1 agonists on the morning of surgery. If a weekly dose is due on the morning of surgery, delay taking it until later in the day after surgery.\n\n【232】#### Bupropion/Naltrexone\n\n【233】This preparation is a combination of an opioid antagonist and an inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake. The weight loss effects are not clearly understood but probably involve the hypothalamus and mesolimbic dopamine circuit. No specific perioperative literature was identified on our review. Because of its blockade of opioid receptors, continuing the medication through procedures requiring opioids for postoperative analgesia is problematic.\n\n【234】_Consensus Recommendation:_ Withhold bupropion/naltrexone for 72 hours before surgery if opioids are expected to be used perioperatively.\n\n【235】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【236】Preoperative medication management is a crucial part of perioperative care. Evidence to guide practice in this area remains deficient, and clinical decision-making is predominantly determined through application of knowledge of medication mechanisms of action and adverse effects. Summarized in Table 1 , Table 2 , Table 3 , this consensus statement provides recommendations of experts in anesthesiology, internal medicine, perioperative medicine, and medical subspecialties for the management of common pulmonary and gastrointestinal medications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The 1958 award was given for his work on the structure of the insulin molecule and the 1980 award for determining the base sequence of nucleic acids. Sanger shared the 1980 prize with Paul Berg (1926-) and Walter Gilbert (1932-). Berg performed fundamental studies of the biochemistry of nucleic acids, particularly recombinant DNA, and Gilbert determined the sequence of bases in DNA by a method applicable to single-and doublestranded DNA. Sanger's work on insulin enabled chemists to synthesize insulin artificially, stimulated research on protein structure, and led to the determination of the structures of many other complex proteins.\n\n【1】Frederick Sanger, the son of a physician, was born on August 13, 1918, in Rendcombe, Gloucestershire, in southwestern England. From 1932 to 1936, he attended the Bryanston School in Blandford in Dorset (southern England). In 1936, he entered St John's College, Cambridge University, and graduated in 1939 with a BA degree in natural science.\n\n【2】Sanger remained at Cambridge University and in 1943 received a PhD degree in biochemistry for investigating the metabolism of the amino acid lysine. From 1944 to 1951, working as a Beit Memorial Fellow for Medical Research, he investigated the order of amino acids in the protein insulin.\n\n【3】In 1951, Sanger joined the staff of the British Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge University and remained there until his retire-ment in 1983. In 1962, he was named director of protein and nucleic acid chemistry at the MRC.\n\n【4】Sanger worked for 10 years to elucidate the structure of the bovine insulin molecule, and by 1955, he had determined the exact order of all the amino acids of the molecule—the first protein molecule to be known in such detail. He also reported his laboratory technique for determining the order in which amino acids are linked in proteins. Sanger's work made it possible for other chemists to identify the exact structure of other compounds. For example, Chinese American biochemist Choh Hao Li (1913-) and his group were able to determine the structure of the pituitary hormone adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) in 1956, and in the early 1950s, American biochemist Vincent Du Vigneaud (1901-1978) determined the structure of the comparatively simple amino acid chains of 2 pituitary hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin, and later synthesized them.\n\n【5】In the 1950s, Sanger became interested in genetics and turned his attention to determining the sequence of nucleotides in molecules of DNA and RNA. In 1975, he decoded the DNA of a small virus, for which he received the 1980 Nobel Prize in chemistry. The work—complete nucleo-tide (base) sequence of the genetic material (DNA) of the virus—done at the MRC laboratory was published in 1977.\n\n【6】Besides the Nobel Prize, Sanger received many other honors, including the Corday-Morgan Medal and Prize of the Chemical Society (1951), the Gairdner Foundation Annual Award (1971 and 1979), the William Bate Hardy Prize of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (1976), the Copley Medal of the Royal Society (1977), the Wheland Award (1978), the Horwitz Prize (1979), and the Lasker Award (1979). In1954, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and was named a Companion of Honor in 1981 and a member of the Order of Merit in 1986. In 1963, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He was honored on a stamp issued by the Palau Islands in 2000.

The investigators retrospectively examined physicians’ responses to questions about cost consciousness obtained from an American Association of Medical Colleges national survey. The investigators then created a scoring system for the responses and linked the physicians’ scores to the Hospital Care Intensity Index of their training hospital. The study found a correlation between high cost-consciousness scores and lower health care intensity in both the training and current practice environments. This study adds to the growing literature on the impact of environment on physicians’ attitudes and behaviors in the realm of cost containment and high-value care. However, the question of how to modulate physicians’ behaviors to simultaneously reduce costs, improve the quality of care, and improve clinical outcomes remains unanswered.\n\n【1】Human behavior is strongly influenced by social norms; individuals continuously calibrate their behavior on the basis of that of their peers, deviating from social norms only moderately.\n\n【2】Not surprisingly, this rule of human behavior applies to physicians’ clinical decision making, to which social norms are established at the level of the peer group, institution, and profession. This effect is particularly striking in those clinical environments in which physicians work in the same hospital or care for overlapping networks of patients.\n\n【3】Variation in patient-sharing networks of physicians across the United States.\n\n【4】For example, studies suggest that spending patterns of the residency training environment and peer networks\n\n【5】impact the cost of care provided by individual physicians, but the specific mechanism of this influence is not clear and cannot be solely attributed to financial incentives.\n\n【6】The route by which practice norms are transmitted to medical trainees is often referred to as the _hidden curriculum_ ; it simultaneously communicates norms of general professional behavior, specialty-specific approaches, and local styles of practice.\n\n【7】Although local societal norms appear to remain influential throughout a physician’s career, the norms of the training environment are likely to be more impactful on physicians’ professional worldviews and clinical practices because the training environment is where clinical habits are initially developed and trainees are systematically assessed and given feedback to help them progress through developmental milestones. The power of the hidden curriculum to impact clinicians’ behaviors in the context of the training environment underscores the importance of providing trainees adequate supervision, role models, and positive peer pressure.\n\n【8】Empathy decline and its reasons: a systematic review of studies with medical students and residents.\n\n【9】But how might this be done? How can we expose and shape the hidden curriculum?\n\n【10】Several approaches to influencing cultural norms in clinical environments have been utilized. Team-based strategies to improve the culture of patient safety have had moderate success, and there is a fairly robust literature supporting the use of audit and feedback to improve the quality of care.\n\n【11】Growing literature, stagnant science? systematic review, meta-regression and cumulative analysis of audit and feedback interventions in health care.\n\n【12】There are fewer data available on how to influence the environment specifically to foster high-value care, but a few interventions have been described. A multicomponent intervention including audit and feedback, system changes, and incentives reduced resident ordering of laboratory tests by 8% over 3 years, and audit and feedback approaches with practicing physicians have had similar success.\n\n【13】However, optimal approaches for influencing the environment or for shaping the hidden curriculum to foster value remain unknown.\n\n【14】Studies have not yet defined and described the cultural factors that support value in clinical settings. It is critical that researchers begin to identify these factors and develop tools for their measurement, but educators and administrators must begin to act to shape the hidden curriculum before the evidence is fully defined. Common sense and experiences in the quality and patient safety arenas can inform these actions. First, we need to encourage cost transparency to sensitize clinicians to how much their actions cost their patients and the system, and train clinicians to intuitively opt for lower-cost options when choosing among equivalent tests and treatments. Studies in academic hospitals have found that the provision of cost information can reduce test ordering by residents and attending physicians by nearly one-third.\n\n【15】Second, to reinforce avoidance of unnecessary care, we must provide clinician- and team-level data regarding utilization of services (specifically utilization of lower-value or discretionary services when possible) with peer comparisons. Third, we should create settings in which clinicians can meet to thoughtfully review their own utilization data and that of their peers and discuss optimizing care in an open and constructive way. Although utilization reflects both appropriate and inappropriate care delivery, providing feedback about variation in services and settings to encourage discussion of appropriate care can foster meaningful consideration of clinical habits that can lead to reductions in inappropriate use, even in the setting of residency training.\n\n【16】It is also critical that we disseminate descriptions and evaluations of these efforts to enhance the evidence on improving value and inform future quality improvement and educational projects both in the training and practice environments.\n\n【17】The research conducted by Ryskina et al has identified a connection between training and practice environments and physicians’ attitudes toward cost-conscious care. Now it is up to us to find ways to positively impact these environments and harness the power of the peer group to promote stewardship and enhance the value of health care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "10d353ba-e20e-4eeb-b6ef-86da95a8e4c5", "title": "Vaccine Safety: Injecting a Dose of Common Sense", "text": "【0】Vaccine Safety: Injecting a Dose of Common Sense\nMortality due to vaccine-preventable diseases is at an all-time low.\n\n【1】Several diseases, including smallpox, polio, and _Haemophilus influenzae_ type b, have been either eradicated or nearly eradicated in the United States through the almost universal use of effective vaccines. Yet during the last decade, increasing concerns (both real and imagined) regarding vaccine adverse effects and safety have arisen. In turn, this has engendered an increasing number of “antivaccine” vaccine” groups, further fueling public and media concerns over a gamut of disorders—hair loss and demyelinating syndromes due to hepatitis B vaccine, autism and inflammatory bowel disease due to measles vaccine, Gulf War illness due to anthrax vaccine, mercury exposure due to the use of thimerosal as a vaccine preservative, and intussusception due to rotavirus vaccine. In addition, these protest groups have raised objections over federal mandates regarding vaccination as a condition for elementary and middle school entry. As we stand on the verge of eradicating and controlling multiple vaccine-preventable diseases, this state of affairs has raised alarm among both scientists and public health officials, as individuals and groups increasingly refuse vaccines.\n\n【2】While the pace of public, media, and congressional interest appears to be accelerating, concerns over vaccine safety are not new. There have always been those opposed to the use of vaccines, even in the face of overwhelming evidence of their benefit. Such was the case with the first vaccine used widely, the smallpox vaccine. Vaccine opponents thought such procedures “unnatural” and feared many ills would result from vaccination.\n\n【3】Had the antivaccination forces prevailed, we would not have eradicated smallpox as a major cause of worldwide suffering and death. Instead, despite the fact that the vaccine is an imperfect one with the risk of occasionally fatal eczema vaccinatum, progressive vaccinia, and postvaccinial encephalitis;\n\n【4】an unparalleled and breathtaking medical and scientific victory for the good of all humankind was achieved by eradicating smallpox disease.\n\n【5】Similarly, because of the universal fear of polio, the introduction of an oral polio vaccine in the late 1950s was greeted with joy and thanksgiving, with the result that polio has been successfully eradicated from the Western Hemisphere, with the reasonable expectation of global eradication in the near future.\n\n【6】Strategies for the global eradication ofpoliomyelitis by the year 2000.\n\n【7】Nonetheless, despite these public health triumphs, vaccines can and do occasionally cause harm. For example, the widespread use of the polio vaccine resulted in vaccine associated paralytic polio in 1 of every 2.4 million vaccine recipients. For this reason, calls for alternate schedules and cessation of the use of this vaccine began in the mid 1980s.\n\n【8】Vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis: United Stales: 197.3 through 1984.\n\n【9】Indeed, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recently recommended that, by January 2000, US children should routinely receive only inactivated polio vaccine for all childhood doses.\n\n【10】Vaccines usually result in widespread and dramatic good but also occasional harm. Logically and rationally discerning cause and effect vs speculation or mere temporal associations in regard to vaccine adverse effects allows for wisdom on the part of patient and clinician in deciding whether to receive or promote a given vaccine.\n\n【11】As an example of discerning cause and effect, fear of Guillian Barré syndrome (GBS) due to influenza vaccine is still prevalent. The 1976–1977 influenza vaccine was associated with a statistically increased risk of GBS in some, but not all, groups of recipients.\n\n【12】The biologic mechanism for this association has never been determined. During the 1992–1993 and 1993–1994 flu seasons, an excess risk of GBS of approximately 1 in 1 million doses delivered was found only when both seasons were combined for analysis.\n\n【13】The Guillain-Barré syndrome and the 1992-1993 and 1993-1994 influenza vaccines.\n\n【14】Whether these statistical associations represent cause and effect remains unclear. Nonetheless, undue fear of such adverse effects prevents some older people who are at high risk of influenza-related hospitalization or death from receiving the vaccine (or some clinicians from recommending vaccination) simply because they fear GBS. Yet, by not accepting the vaccine, such individuals accept risks that are orders of magnitude higher (such as the 20,000 excess deaths or 250,000 excess hospitalizations due to influenza observed nearly every year) than any possible risk from the vaccine. Unfortunately health care workers themselves are not immune to unfounded fears of adverse effects. Despite being at moderate risk for hepatitis B infection and its chronic sequelae, health care workers were among the last to embrace receipt of the plasma-derived vaccine, due to unfounded concerns of possible human immunodeficiency virus contamination.\n\n【15】Finally, concern arose over the temporal association of varicella vaccination and occurrence of a rash in the first 2 weeks after its administration. Had the vaccine caused the very illness it was supposed to prevent? Polymerase chain reaction testing proved these concerns were unfounded by demonstrating that most rashes occurring within 2 weeks of varicella vaccination were caused by wild-type, not vaccine-type, virus.\n\n【16】While the risk of an adverse event increases with the number of vaccines administered, the risk of morbid adverse effects nonetheless remains vanishingly small, and the risk of morbidity or mortality from infection and subsequent disease due to a vaccine-preventable illness remains significant.\n\n【17】It is instructive to consider how we have moved from a society that celebrated the introduction of the polio vaccine to one in which vaccines are viewed with suspicion and increasingly are rejected by patients and clinicians. It is our view that a discussion of how the public views vaccine safety cannot be divorced from the culture in which we live, work, and make decisions. Many would argue that we have become a “zero risk” culture. We behave as though any risk of any harm can be reduced to zero—especially with regard to technologic risk. Our litigious society focuses on the concept that a bad outcome is a wrongful outcome and that someone must be held responsible and pay damages. Appropriately, so as to avoid accusations of malice and lawsuits for recovery of damages, government and industry work to minimize liability by minimizing risk. While this focus and the response it engenders clearly result in some level of public good, they also create a dissonant atmosphere where harm cannot be completely prevented and some risks remain irreducible or uncertain. Yet to do nothing harms the greater public good. In our society, individuals sue for spilled hot coffee and falls on rain-slick pavement. A bad medical outcome engenders plans for a malpractice suit even when no evidence exists for incompetent practice. The bad outcome itself becomes prima facie evidence of incompetence. In part, juries and judges need not ground their decisions in science but can be moved by emotion and public opinion. Further, US consumers can generally afford the manufacturers' increases in product charges when the costs of product liability insurance and legal expenses are passed on to them. However, in the case of the controversy over whole-cell pertussis vaccine, manufacturers substantially increased the cost of pertussis vaccine in response to an ever-increasing number of lawsuits and financial liability. Due to concerns over liability, several manufacturers simply stopped producing pertussis vaccine, which resulted in a sufficient crisis that the federal government developed a vaccine injury compensation program to protect manufacturers and prevent the loss of the nation's ability to manufacture and distribute pertussis vaccine.\n\n【18】We propose that a “pyramid effect” is operative in the way decisions are made about vaccine safety and acceptance in our risk-intolerant society. The base of the pyramid can be imagined to resemble the benefit of a widespread public health policy such as the use of a vaccine to prevent a common disease that causes harm. It is broad in its effects. The vaccine benefits the vast majority of the public. The peak of the pyramid represents harm or risk. It is small but sharp. While it may affect very few individuals, its effects are perceived as severe and acute. The majority benefits from the vaccine but feels the benefit only indirectly or perhaps not at all. A minority may actually be harmed or perceive harm, but they perceive it sharply, acutely, and substantially. For this reason, the voices of the shareholders in the public health policy debate over vaccines are unbalanced. The majority who benefit will not champion or defend the program but are likely to be passive participants. The minority who experience or perceive harm may choose to fight against the program that they perceive as causing harm and may become passionate and vociferous opponents. In fact, they may become the only individuals who voice their opinions.\n\n【19】In part, the perception of risk or probability of harm in this pyramid model may arise from another problem, namely, a dilution of benefit. As the use of a safe and efficacious vaccine becomes widespread and gradually diminishes or eliminates the risk of a disease, the public's perception of the vaccine's value paradoxically diminishes—because the public no longer observes the disease or its aftermath. The very success of the vaccine causes its benefit to be diluted or less valued once the disease is no longer considered a high-level threat or risk. Vaccines commonly suffer from this dilution of benefit. For example, the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine has been extraordinarily successful in reducing deaths and morbidity such as sterility, encephalitis, and congenital rubella syndrome.\n\n【20】However, individual parents may fail to see its current relevance for their children in that the parents do not perceive the children to be at risk and are unaware of the disease and its consequences. Naturally then such parents would fail to understand the importance of protection against these diseases. For these parents, the vaccine seems unnecessary at best and an intrusive and dangerous assault on personal liberties at worst. Further, those who claim that the measles vaccine is the agent responsible for inflammatory bowel disease or autism raise unfounded fears in others' minds and may accuse the physician, medical industry, public health officials, and the government of incompetence and even malevolence. Unfortunately, while the overwhelming majority suffers no harm from the vaccine, they may also perceive no immediate benefit and therefore see no reason to challenge or resist the accusation. The person at the point of the pyramid, acutely harmed and intensely emotional, commands more “voice” with the media and captures the attention of the public (or Congress). The majority at the base of the pyramid, with their real but diffuse and poorly perceived benefit, remains silent because of little or no emotional investment in the issue. The more effective a vaccine is the more powerful the dilution of benefit appears to be. Everyone gains but no one perceives that benefit.\n\n【21】Chen has proposed a model that attempts to define these stages of an immunization program starting with the introduction of a new vaccine, in which such programs go from the prevaccine stage to the stage of increasing vaccine coverage, loss of confidence in the vaccine (due to real or perceived adverse effects), resumption of vaccine confidence, eradication of disease, and finally cessation of vaccine use.\n\n【22】As a society we select vaccines for which the population benefits outweigh the risks of adverse events and for which there is a substantial burden of disease morbidity and mortality in the population. We must keep in the forefront of any discussion of vaccine safety the understanding of this benefit-risk balance. Vaccines can and do cause harm and may even theoretically carry unknown risks. Vaccines are immunobiologics, and all immunobiologics have been associated with adverse effects, from the frequent occurrence of brief and mild local inflammation following tetanus toxoid injection to the rare occurrence of paralytic polio following administration of the oral polio vaccine. The whole-cell pertussis vaccine may rarely result in hypotonic, hyporesponsive episodes. The hepatitis B vaccine can cause a febrile reaction in a small percentage of newborn infants, which could lead to an unnecessary medical evaluation if not presumptive antibiotic treatment. The rotavirus vaccine appears to increase the risk of intussusception in the weeks that follow the first dose of vaccine in infants. These adverse effects complicate decision making about vaccines at the individual and societal levels, in part because it is impossible to know all the possible risks of a given vaccine until it is used widely in the population.\n\n【23】A current example is that of the rhesus reassortant rotavirus vaccine and the association with intussusception.\n\n【24】In modern vaccine development, prelicensure studies identify only frequent adverse events, regardless of whether the adverse events are mild, moderate, or severe. In the case of the prelicensure studies of the rotavirus vaccine, approximately 10,000 children received the vaccine. While 5 children did suffer from intussusception, so did 1 child among the 5000 controls; the rates of intussusception were not statistically different between the 2 groups.\n\n【25】This is not surprising, as prelicensure studies are unlikely to identify statistically significant rare adverse events that occur at rates in the range of greater than 1 of 1000 to 10,000. We depend on a system of postlicensure follow-up studies by the manufacturer, large linked databases, and continued monitoring through a governmental passive reporting system (the Vaccine Adverse Events Re- porting System) to identify unexpected adverse effects of vaccines.\n\n【26】The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).\n\n【27】Cristallographie analysis of endogenous peptides associated with HLA-DR1 suggests a common, polvproline II-like conformation for bound peptides.\n\n【28】This system in fact allowed public health officials to quickly detect the increase in intussusception cases following rotavirus vaccination and to declare a moratorium on use of the vaccine, followed shortly by the manufacturer's withdrawal of the vaccine from the market. Antivaccine groups see this episode as evidence that vaccines are unsafe, while scientists and public health officials see this as proof that the detection system for adverse events works. What is unclear to the antivaccine groups is that one can never prove or disprove absolute safety of a vaccine or completely eliminate all uncertainty or risk of an adverse event. We are only able to lower the probability of an adverse event into an interval of extraordinary infrequency. This is the nature of scientific proof in clinical trials and of the difficulty in demonstrating cause and effect. In tum, these risk probability concepts and results are extremely difficult to articulate clearly to a risk-averse public.\n\n【29】Despite such irreducible uncertainties, the modern use of vaccines has clearly benefited more than harmed. Over the last century, the human life span has increased 20 to 25 years. It is postulated that this profound change in life span has resulted from 2 major changes: clean water and sanitation and the control of infectious diseases. To the latter, we must give credit to the development and widespread population use of vaccines. As an example, diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, smallpox, and polio have been either reduced from their baseline levels by 98% to 99% in the United States or completely eradicated as in the case with smallpox and polio.\n\n【30】Such results are unprecedented in human history and are an outcome of the nearly universal population use of multiple safe and effective vaccines.\n\n【31】Maintaining the current success of disease control by vaccines and extending that success to other potentially vaccine-preventable diseases (such as group B streptococcus, herpes simplex, human papillomavirus, cytomegalovirus, and others) is threatened. This may be due in part to an eroding trust on the public's part regarding the safety and efficacy of vaccines, an erosion of trust in “experts” and the government, and the (generally) poor attempts on the part of the health community to communicate the risks and benefits of vaccines to the public. Moreover, any discussion of risk suffers from the “hidden” nature of many communicable diseases and their complications. Lay people and even clinicians may not feel the urgency for varicella immunization, for example. Many recall chickenpox as a mild childhood annoyance and have little experience with varicella as a disease with considerable attendant morbidity and mortality. Thus, most do not perceive varicella as a real threat, despite the fact that it is a highly contagious human virus causing 100 deaths per year in the United States and resulting in hospitalization of approximately 1 of every 164 persons with varicella.\n\n【32】Contrast this with the incredible demand and uptake of the polio vaccine in the late 1950s and early 1960s, because everyone at that time understood the risks of disease and of not being protected by vaccine. They regularly witnessed the devastation caused by polio on their community, friends, and family. Thus, the perception of both disease and vaccine risk within a culture may heavily influence choices regarding immunization. In addition, others have commented on the growing role of the current antivaccine movement in the United States and Europe and have documented the consequences of such groups' actions in creating fear of receiving vaccines such as pertussis, the resultant lower immunization coverage rates, and the inevitable reemergence in morbidity and mortality due to those diseases.\n\n【33】Impact of anti-vaccine movements on pertussis control: the untold story.\n\n【34】What other factors have contributed to the current antivaccine ethos? In part, the federal government's response to concerns over vaccine safety and its role in vaccine delivery at the population level may inadvertently stimulate negative responses from the populace. Mandatory federal programs with punitive consequences for failure to comply, as opposed to “promotive” immunization programs, are felt to be an important reason underlying vaccine nonacceptance.\n\n【35】For example, mandating an increasing number of vaccines that the public has been ill educated to accept or understand breeds concern, suspicion, and, in some cases, resentment. Evidence for this is the number of anti vaccine groups that frequently cite this very issue. Additionally, federal attempts to institute childhood immunization registries in each county and each state may further fuel concerns about the role of government in individual health affairs and raise additional privacy concerns. In turn, these factors feed into the cultural milieu in the United States of questioning authority, particularly the right of the government, to “coerce individuals to have themselves or their children vaccinated.”\n\n【36】In addition, the widespread electronic information network and ease of communication now allow all voices to be heard in the public debate, without regard to the authenticity or agenda of the information presented. Thus, we see the propagation of Web sites with misguided and, in some cases, simply wrong information presented as established scientific fact. Inappropriate actions by opinion leaders also contribute to suspicion regarding vaccines. Recent examples include the widely reported congressional hearings on vaccine safety and actions taken by the French government to suspend temporarily the adolescent hepatitis B immunization program in that country (they have since restored the program).\n\n【37】How then do public health and individual practitioners proceed in such an environment? To protect the public health, vaccinologists, scientists, and public health officials must participate in the current debate over vaccine safety, risks, and benefits and carefully examine the consequences of individual and collective societal decisions about vaccines. They must do this with solid scientific data and with skills in transmitting such information despite irreducible uncertainties. Policymakers and public health officials must develop an explicit framework or “decision map” on which to make rational and explicit decisions about the deployment of vaccines. Doing so facilitates public debate and understanding and provides a basis by which we can defend decisions that occasionally result in unexpected, unacceptable risks and the retreat from a previous recommendation. Public health officials must recognize that such a process may result in the viewpoint that not all vaccines should necessarily be received by everyone, without regard to individual or group risk, simply because such a vaccine exists.\n\n【38】We propose that practical first steps include ensuring that physicians, nurses, and other health care workers are better informed and educated regarding vaccines and riskbenefit issues regarding vaccines. This education process needs to start during professional education and extend throughout continuing education. Ample evidence suggests that frontline providers have inadequate knowledge about vaccines and vaccine administration prograrns.\n\n【39】Time Development Committee. Developing curricula 1o promote preventive medicine skills: the leaching Immunization for Medical Education (TIME) Project.\n\n【40】addition, in partnership with federal, state, and public health programs, we must once again create a culture whereby immunization against infectious diseases is seen as the right thing to do and is reestablished as the prevailing cultural norm. Streefland et al comment that “the imminent expansion of vaccination schedules with more vaccines and vaccine combinations will only enhance parents' doubts and trigger discussion. It will stress parents' perception that, in vaccination practice, ‘experts’ are making fundamental decisions about their children's health, without consultation or providing the option to exempt.” For this reason, our own view is that the role of the government is to inform, educate, recommend, and even provide incentives for immunization—but not to mandate without exclusion acceptance among the civilian population. Informed refusal must remain an acceptable choice in a free democracy, and the culture of informed consent, with both religious and philosophical exemption, must be maintained. The difficult balancing act will be in determining the right of the state to control an infectious disease and the right of the individual to choose. This might be partly resolved by considering (with informed refusal) universal immunization against those diseases that pose unacceptable risks to others in the community.\n\n【41】In addition, increasing the funds available for vaccine research, including funding for the development of safer and more effective vaccines, and establishing large, long- term postmarketing safety studies are important steps. A major priority should be to set aside research funds dedicated to finding and understanding genetic (and other) factors predictive of severe vaccine adverse events. Finally, government and the health care industry would be wise to fund social research aimed at understanding immunization acceptance behaviors of the public in general and specific ethnic groups with low vaccine uptake in particular.\n\n【42】As a society, it is in our interest to protect ourselves against the morbidity and mortality of diseases we can prevent with vaccines. It is also to our benefit to minimize any harm that may arise from such vaccines. But we must recognize that to maximize widespread benefits, we must be prepared to incur some lesser risks, and in the final analysis, government and public health officials must be prepared to engage in the hard work of forming partnerships with vaccine experts and the public in order to make decisions that are seen as benefiting both the individual and society. Coupled with informed debate, we must use science, technology, and common sense to our maximum advantage, while maintaining rights of freedom of choice, in order to choose wisely among the growing number of vaccines and deploy the optimal set of vaccines for each individual and for society as a whole.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Fait accompli. On to this narrative has been grafted the hopes that telemedicine will solve other persistent problems, particularly in primary care.\n\n【1】As with any other technology, the divine is in the details.\n\n【2】What Problems in Primary Care Are in Need of a Fix?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【3】The challenges for primary care are deep and structural. Inequity in payment for cognitive versus procedural care\n\n【4】 conflating how primary care has been valued with its value; equating the payment allocated for primary care services with the difficulty in their mastery (contributing to the assumption that lesser training is of little consequence in primary care); and a shrinking scope of practice for physicians within the specialty are among the reasons our health system has not benefitted fully from what a well-supported, well-organized model of primary care has to offer.\n\n【5】Can Telemedicine Fix What Ails Primary Care?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Certainly, telemedicine cannot solve the structural causes above, but can it improve capacity and access while also reducing time pressure and burnout? If this is possible, what are physicians and their teams doing during now in-person visits that is not necessary and could be eliminated? Arguably, it should require even more time rather than less to accurately read the fewer signals available from patients during a video visit and to be sure that the real reason for the visit, the third or fourth complaint, reaches the surface.\n\n【7】Learning From Electronic Health Record Transformation\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Twenty years ago, electronic health records (EHRs) were anticipated as a technology that would improve quality, efficiency, and professional mastery. All of our patients’ information would be at our fingertips whether we were at the clinic, the hospital, or at home. Clinical decision support, pop-up reminders, and hard-stops during order entry would make us better physicians.\n\n【9】And yet the EHR was not the savior of primary care, but instead, for all of its benefits, its burdens fell disproportionately to primary care physicians. Many tasks take more time when performed on the EHR.\n\n【10】Tethered to the EHR: primary care physician workload assessment using EHR event log data and time-motion observations.\n\n【11】In addition, with the mistaken beliefs that technology will allow the physician to do other role types, work and that this work can magically be accomplished in the interstitial time between other work, time pressure for physicians intensified after EHR implementations. Tasks previously managed by receptionists, transcriptionists, medical records clerks, et cetera, have been shifted to physicians; work has spilled over into home,\n\n【12】Allocation of physician time in ambulatory practice: a time and motion study in 4 specialties.\n\n【13】stealing time from family, friends, and personal well-being\n\n【14】 and the EHR provided vastly more opportunities for monitoring, measuring,\n\n【15】US physician practices spend more than $15.4 billion annually to report quality measures.\n\n【16】reprimanding, and penalizing physicians.\n\n【17】Going Forward\n-------------\n\n【18】What are the lessons learned that could ensure that similar stumbles do not befall the promising technology of telemedicine?\n\n【19】### Design, Implement, and Regulate With Teams in Mind\n\n【20】In each encounter, whether in-person or video, there is too much to be done by just one person, and it is too important to leave to chance. The doctor cannot single-handedly do all the work of the visit and do it well; this mindset blinded many to the risks to patient safety, patient trust, and professional well-being associated with many EHR implementations. There is no need to repeat those mistakes with telemedicine.\n\n【21】### Recognize That Multitasking is Hazardous\n\n【22】Providing patients undivided attention is one of the most powerful tools in any physician’s toolkit. Multitasking, which is really task switching, is hazardous. During a remote visit, because there are fewer cues to read, the physician must be fully attentive to all available, rather than simultaneously transcribing the visit note, entering orders, sending medications to the pharmacy, ticking off performance measures, and composing the billing invoice. Humans have a finite cognitive bandwidth; the more time spent on clerical tasks, the less available for deep clinical work.\n\n【23】### Prioritize Relationships\n\n【24】Health care is not just a series of transactions for which anybody will do, but is built on relationships. Diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic adherence are greater, and waste reduced, in the context of a trusting ongoing relationship.\n\n【25】Telemedicine is not inherently transactional, and by bringing the physician and team closer into patients’ lives it can support and enhance relationships. To realize this potential, however, a priority must be placed on continuity and relationships.\n\n【26】### Practice Truth in Time Accounting\n\n【27】It is important to avoid thinking that a physician can somehow do more in less time during video rather than in-person visits. Work that physicians and others perform outside of the encounter is still work and takes time. Likewise, work that occurs at home is work, and deserves to be counted. Some tasks are quicker when done with a technology assist and at other times work on a technology platform can take more time. It all needs to be counted and understood.\n\n【28】### Invest in the Science of Practice\n\n【29】Teamwork, planning, and efficient workflows are essential. Not every problem is best suited to a technological fix. In fact, technology, such as artificial intelligence, used to compensate for an underlying disorganized system of care\n\n【30】can be cumbersome and costly.\n\n【31】For example, appropriately scheduling patients from the outset saves time and improves patient experience. At the end of today’s appointment, the team can set up the next appointment, with all associated tests for prevention and chronic illness monitoring, customized to this particular patient, accommodating the patient’s preference for an in-person or virtual appointment.\n\n【32】No need then for a last-minute “schedule sweep” to cancel the patient after an algorithm deemed their appointment unnecessary.\n\n【33】Likewise, centralizing population health as the primary vehicle for prevention and chronic illness care can be an unnecessary source of further fragmentation, depersonalization, and waste within the health care system. Instead, using an organized system of care, all of the patient’s annual needs for prevention and chronic illness monitoring can be arranged at a single, coordinated appointment rather than being fragmented, with the patient contacted 1 month for their mammogram, the next month for their pneumococcal vaccine, and at yet another time for their urine test for microalbumin. A registry, whether managed centrally or more personally at the local level by the patient’s team, can catch those patients who fall through the cracks of an organized system, but to use it as the primary vehicle by which to manage populations is cumbersome and reduces customization at the level of the individual experience.\n\n【34】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【35】During the storm that is coronavirus disease 2019, telemedicine arrived with a bang and is thankfully here to stay. It will take time to understand all of its risks and benefits, the appropriate patients for in-person versus virtual care, and to develop the optimal models of teamwork for this platform. Let us not repeat the mistakes encountered when EHR implementations were anticipated through rose colored glasses, but rather look with clear eyes to the lessons from the past generation’s technology challenges.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Unfortunately, the most common epithelial cancers, which cause more than 75% of cancer deaths, remain incurable.

This approach has predominantly identified DNA-active drugs, which have limited efficacy and considerable toxicity.

This effort combines medicine, aviation, and radio to bring care to the people who live, work, and travel in remote areas of Australia. Established in 1928 and developed on a national basis in the 1930s, the service soon provided not only emergency medical aid to the people of the inland of Australia but also comprehensive health care and community services. In 1957, Australia issued a stamp (Scott No. 305) in honor of the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia. The issuance of this stamp offers an opportunity to honor its founder, the Reverend John Flynn.\n\n【1】John Flynn was born on November 25, 1880, in Moliagul in central Victoria, Australia. His father was a schoolteacher, and John was the youngest of 3 children; his mother had died in childbirth when John was only 3 years old. For several years, John lived with relatives before the family was reunited at Snake Gully (near Ballarat in south central Victoria, about 70 miles northwest of Melbourne). The family later moved to a suburb of Melbourne, where John's father began an unsuccessful business venture.\n\n【2】In 1898, John graduated from secondary school and began teaching. In 1903, when he was residing in Victoria, he decided to become a minister of the Presbyterian Church. In 1907, he began a 4-year course in divinity training at Melbourne University; he graduated in 1910 and was ordained in January 1911.\n\n【3】While preparing for the ministry, Flynn became interested in working in “the outback” (the wild central and northern inland of Australia). In February 1911, he began his work in the outback when he arrived at Beltana in South Australia, about 300 miles north of Adelaide, where medical care was unavailable to the inland residents and travelers. Flynn reported to his church about the conditions in the outback and was appointed head of a new organization, the Australian Inland Mission (AIM). During the next few years, the organization founded several nursing homes and recruited ministers to travel to vast outback parishes by camel or on horseback, visiting communities and households and tending to the people of the inland.\n\n【4】Flynn helped establish bush hospitals and hostels in remote outback regions. In 1903, the first powered air flights had taken place, and by 1918, the airplane was beginning to prove itself as a reliable means of transportation. Flynn saw the potential in the use of the airplane. By 1928, AIM had sufficient funds to establish the Flying Doctor Service, and on May 15, 1928, the Aerial Medical Service was established at Cloncurry in northwestern Queensland. After many years of dreaming, hard work, and planning, the Flying Doctor Service became a reality. The first official flight occurred on May 17, 1928, from Cloncurry to Julia Creek, a distance of about 80 miles. The first flying doctor was Sydney surgeon Kenyon St. Vincent Welch. The trial year (1928) began without a radio network. The Flying Doctor Service relied on telephone links between towns and settlements and on people physically traveling long distances for help. What was needed was a portable, cheap, and reliable 2-way radio with a range of 300 miles. This became a reality in 1929 when the Cloncurry Base radio station became operative.\n\n【5】By 1932, AIM had a network of 10 small hospitals. During this early period, Dr Alan Vickers, a flying doctor, lobbied for a network of flying doctor bases spread across the entire continent of Australia.\n\n【6】In 1934, the Presbyterian Church transferred the work to the Australian Aerial Medical Service, which during the next few years established services across Australia with operational bases at Wyndham (northwestern Western Australia), Kalgoorlie (southern Western Australia), Broken Hill (western New South Wales), Alice Springs (south central Northern Territory), and Meekatharra (Western Australia), along with bases in Charters Towers (eastern Queensland) and Charleville (southern Queensland). In 1942, the service was renamed the “Flying Doctor Service,” and in 1955, the Queen of England granted the use of the Royal prefix.\n\n【7】On May 5, 1951, at the age of 70 years, John Flynn died in Sydney, New South Wales, and was buried near Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, the center of the vast area in which he had worked.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

It is equally important to appreciate the differences in the approaches to diagnosis between children and adults, men and women, and persons of different ethnic backgrounds. Regardless of the specific algorithm followed in evaluating anemia, it is essential that easily remediable causes such as nutritional deficiencies, hemolysis, and anemia of renal insufficiency are identified early and treated appropriately. In general, the differential diagnosis of anemia can be substantially narrowed by subcategorization into “microcytic,” “normocytic,” and “macrocytic” subtypes on the basis of mean corpuscular volume. However, such classification is a starting point and not infallible. Each category then can be deciphered using a stepwise approach that utilizes readily accessible laboratory tests.\n\n【1】ACD ( anemia of chronic disease ), CD ( Castleman disease ), HL ( Hodgkin lymphoma ), IDA ( iron deficiency anemia ), MCV ( mean corpuscular volume ), MMM ( myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia ), RCC ( renal cell carcinoma ), RDW ( red blood cell distribution width )\n\n【2】Anemia is defined as a decrease in hemoglobin (or hematocrit) level from an individual's baseline value. Because individual baseline hemoglobin levels often are not readily accessible, physicians use sex-specific and race-specific reference ranges to make a working diagnosis of anemia. In general, “normal” hemoglobin levels are 1 to 2 g/dL lower in women and African American men than in white men.\n\n【3】In routine clinical practice, laboratory, rather than clinical, parameters are most useful in formulating a practical diagnostic approach.\n\n【4】Accordingly, the mean red blood cell volume (mean corpuscular volume \\[MCV\\]) is used first to classify the anemic process as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic .\n\n【5】Table 1 An Operational Classification of Anemia\n\n【6】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【7】MCV = mean corpuscular volume.\n\n| Microcytic anemias (MCV, <80 fL)Iron deficiency anemiaThalassemiaNonthalassemic conditions associated with microcytosis other than iron deficiency anemiaAnemia of chronic disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, Hodgkin lymphoma)Sideroblastic anemia (eg, hereditary, lead poisoning)Normocytic anemias (MCV, 80–100 fL)Nutritional anemias (eg, iron deficiency anemia)Anemia of renal insufficiencyHemolytic anemiasRed cell intrinsic causesMembranopathies (eg, hereditary spherocytosis)Enzymopathies (eg, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency)Hemoglobinopathies (eg, sickle cell disease)Red cell extrinsic causesImmune mediatedAutoimmuneDrug associatedVirus associatedLymphoid disorder associatedIdiopathicAlloimmuneImmediate transfusion reactionDelayed transfusion reactionNeonatal hemolytic anemiaMicroangiopathic (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome)Infection associated (eg, falciparum malaria)Chemical agent associated (eg, spider venoms)Anemia of chronic disease (believed to be cytokine mediated)Primary bone marrow disorderCauses that are intrinsic to the hematopoietic stem cellAplastic anemia (idiopathic, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, Fanconi anemia)Pure red cell aplasia (acquired, congenital \\[DiamondBlackfan syndrome\\])Ineffective erythropoiesis (myelodysplastic syndrome and other myeloid disorders)Extrinsic causesDrugs, toxins, radiation, virus (parvovirus, etc)Immune mediated (contributes to aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia)Bone marrow infiltrating processes such as metastatic cancer and lymphomaMacrocytic anemias (MCV, >100 fL)Drug induced (hydroxyurea, zidovudine, methotrexate, etc)Nutritional (vitamin B 12 /folate deficiency)Non–drug induced, nonnutritional macrocytic anemiaMarked macrocytosis (MCV, >110 fL)Clonal hematologic disorder (myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, large granular lymphocyte disorder)Mild macrocytosis (MCV, 100–110 fL)Oval macrocytes (clonal hematologic disorder)Round macrocytes (excess alcohol usage, liver disease)Reticulocytes (hemolytic anemia)Spurious (presence of cold agglutinins, hyperglycemia) |\n| --- |\n\n【9】\\* MCV = mean corpuscular volume.\n\n【10】MICROCYTIC ANEMIA\n-----------------\n\n【11】### Step 1. Rule Out Iron Deficiency Anemia\n\n【12】Iron deficiency is the most common cause of microcytic anemia. The definitive test for iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is measurement of serum ferritin. A low serum ferritin level is diagnostic of an iron-depleted state.\n\n【13】Contrary to current dogma that says the serum ferritin level may be spuriously elevated in the presence of acute phase reaction, a diagnosis of IDA is extremely unlikely in the presence of either normal or elevated serum ferritin levels. The other serum iron studies (serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, transferrin saturation) do not accurately distinguish IDA from anemia of chronic disease (ACD) and therefore have limited value in the evaluation of microcytic anemia. Similarly, assessment of iron stores through bone marrow biopsy is neither necessary nor accurate for evaluation of IDA.\n\n【14】Instead, a finite treatment trial with iron supplementation is both a cost-effective and definitive way of addressing the issue in equivocal cases.\n\n【15】Although not definitive, there are other clues for diagnosing IDA. For example, microcytic anemia associated with increased red blood cell distribution width (RDW) favors a diagnosis of IDA over that of ACD. In contrast, microcytic anemia associated with increased red blood cell count is characteristic of the thalassemia trait. However, it should be remembered that microcytosis without anemia could occur in the thalassemia trait and in polycythemia associated with iron deficiency.\n\n【16】The peripheral blood smear in IDA usually shows anisocytosis and poikilocytosis. In severe cases, cigar-shaped red blood cells and elliptocytes are characteristically present. In contrast, polychromasia (the Wright-Giemsa stain equivalent of reticulocytosis), basophilic stippling, and target cells are conspicuously absent in IDA but are characteristic features in thalassemia. Finally, IDA may be associated with reactive thrombocytosis.\n\n【17】### Step 2. Evaluation of Microcytic Anemia With Normal Serum Ferritin\n\n【18】If the serum ferritin level is normal, the next step in evaluating microcytic anemia depends on whether the microcytosis is new or previously recognized. If the microcytosis is preexisting, it implies a congenital disorder, and a diagnosis of thalassemia should be considered. If the microcytosis is new, a nonthalassemic condition associated with acquired microcytosis is a possibility.\n\n【19】#### Thalassemic Syndromes\n\n【20】Approximately 97% of normal hemoglobin in adults (hemoglobin A) consists of equal quantities of $aL-globin and β-globin chains (a <sub>2 </sub> ß <sub>2 </sub> ). _Thalassemia_ is defined as a hemoglobinopathy associated with decreased production of either of the 2 normal globin chains (eg, $aL-thalassemia or β-thalassemia) or a structurally abnormal globin chain (eg, hemoglobin E). The resulting unbalanced globin chain production results in microcytosis and an alteration in the normal hemoglobin electrophoresis pattern. Therefore, hemoglobin electrophoresis is the initial test of choice in the investigation of thalassemia. However, it is important to note that hemoglobin electrophoresis does not always detect the presence of thalassemia. To appreciate the utility of both hemoglobin electrophoresis and genetic testing in thalassemia, each of the thalassemic syndromes ($aL-thalassemia, β-thalassemia, and structurally abnormal globin chain thalassemia) are considered separately.\n\n【21】#### α-Thalassemia\n\n【22】The production of a-globin chains is controlled by 4 genes (2 per haploid chromosome). Mutation of all 4 genes is incompatible with life (hydrops fetalis). Mutation of only 1 of the 4 genes causes neither anemia nor microcytosis (silent carrier). Mutation of 2 of the 4 genes results in both microcytosis and mild anemia (a-thalassemia trait). Mutation of 3 of the 4 genes allows excess β-chains to form tetramers (hemoglobin H) and results in severe anemia in addition to microcytosis. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is normal in the $aL-thalassemia trait and abnormal in hemoglobin H disease. Genetic testing (polymerase chain reaction-based DNA tests and Southern blot analysis) can reveal the molecular defect in the $aL-thalassemia trait.\n\n【23】However, a working diagnosis can be made and genetic counseling can be initiated on the basis of family history and ethnic origin and without resorting to DNA testing.\n\n【24】#### β-Thalassemia\n\n【25】β-Globin chain production is controlled by 2 genes (1 per haploid chromosome). β-Thalassemia occurs as a trait (1 of 2 gene mutations) or symptomatic disease (mutations of both genes). In the β-thalassemia trait, the level of hemoglobin A <sub>2 </sub> (α <sub>2 </sub> δ <sub>2 </sub> ) may increase from the normal value of 2% to a value of 3% to 6%. However, if iron deficiency coexists, the expected increase in hemoglobin A <sub>2 </sub> may not occur. Therefore, a normal hemoglobin A <sub>2 </sub> level may not exclude the possibility of the β-thalassemia trait unless a simultaneously measured normal serum ferritin level is documented. In β-thalassemia disease, the hemoglobin electrophoresis reveals mostly hemoglobin F (α <sub>2 </sub> γ <sub>2 </sub> ). A slight or moderate increase in hemoglobin F may also be seen in the β-thalassemia trait and in compound heterozygotes. Therefore, in general, hemoglobin electrophoresis is often adequate for evaluating β-thalassemia, and genetic testing may be unnecessary.\n\n【26】#### Structurally Abnormal Globin Chain Thalassemia\n\n【27】Some structural hemoglobinopathies can produce a thalassemic (microcytic) phenotype as a result of decreased globin synthesis. Examples include hemoglobin E (a structural hemoglobinopathy, prevalent in Southeast Asia, that results from an RNA splice site mutation associated with the production of an alternative messenger RNA that is not effectively translated), hemoglobin Lepore (resulting from the fusion of the δ-and β-globin genes with decreased transcription efficiency), and hemoglobin Constant Spring (resulting from a stop codon mutation and synthesis of a longer, unstable globin chain messenger RNA). These thalassemic syndromes usually are identified by routine hemoglobin electrophoresis, and genetic testing may not be required.\n\n【28】#### Nonthalassemic Conditions Associated With Microcytosis Other Than IDA\n\n【29】The differential diagnosis of nonthalassemic, non-IDA microcytic anemia includes ACD and hereditary or acquired sideroblastic anemia. The latter is a rare disorder that is characterized by increased RDW, dimorphic red blood cells, and bone marrow ring sideroblasts.\n\n【30】Anemia in ACD is usually normocytic. However, some systemic diseases (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, diabetes mellitus, connective tissue disease, chronic infection, Hodgkin lymphoma \\[HL\\], Castleman disease \\[CD\\], renal cell carcinoma \\[RCC\\], and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia \\[MMM\\]) can be accompanied by microcytic anemia. The first 5 aforementioned diseases often are associated with mild microcytosis characterized by a normal RDW and an unremarkable peripheral blood smear. Diagnosis is made on clinical grounds, and bone marrow examination is unnecessary.\n\n【31】Microcytic anemia associated with HL, CD, or RCC often is accompanied by systemic manifestations including fever and other constitutional symptoms. Other symptoms include pruritus (HL), lymphadenopathy (HL, CD), monoclonal gammopathy (CD), hematuria (RCC), or splenomegaly (MMM, HL, CD). Peripheral blood smear shows leukoerythroblastosis (the presence of nucleated red blood cells and immature myeloid cells) in MMM. Obviously, bone marrow examination is indicated if these disorders are suspected.\n\n【32】NORMOCYTIC ANEMIA\n-----------------\n\n【33】### Step 1. Rule Out Readily Treatable Causes\n\n【34】The critical issue in evaluating any form of anemia is to recognize treatable causes early. In normocytic anemia, treatable causes include nutritional anemias, anemia of renal insufficiency, and hemolytic anemia.\n\n【35】#### Nutritional Anemias\n\n【36】In patients with normocytic anemia, both iron and vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> /folate deficiencies are possible causes despite their usual association with microcytic and macrocytic anemias, respectively. Therefore, the initial investigation of normocytic anemia should include determination of both serum ferritin and serum vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> /folate levels .\n\n【37】#### Anemia of Renal Insufficiency\n\n【38】Anemia of renal insufficiency is associated with an unremarkable peripheral blood smear and an inappropriately normal serum erythropoietin level. Although anemia is severe and symptomatic only with advanced kidney disease (serum creatinine, >3 mg/dL), mild to moderate anemia may be seen in moderate renal insufficiency (serum creatinine, 1.5-3 mg/dL), especially in diabetic patients with nephrotic syndrome. If initial tests are unrevealing, the possibility of hemolysis should be considered.\n\n【39】#### Hemolytic Anemia\n\n【40】In all types of hemolytic anemia, laboratory evidence of increased cell destruction (suggested by increased lactate dehydrogenase), increased hemoglobin catabolism (suggested by increased levels of indirect bilirubin), decreased levels of haptoglobin (a serum protein that clears free hemoglobin), and bone marrow regenerative effort (suggested by reticulocytosis) may be appreciated. Therefore, when a hemolytic process is suspected, initial tests should include measurement of lactate dehydrogenase, indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, and reticulocyte count. None of these tests are specific or able to distinguish among the various causes of hemolytic anemia.\n\n【41】As with the anemia classification as a whole, the hemolytic anemias can be classified in many ways. One practical classification separates causes that are inherent to the red blood cell from causes that are extrinsic to the red blood cell . However, in routine clinical practice, it may be preferable to first distinguish extra-vascular (occurring in the monocyte-macrophage system of the spleen and liver) from intravascular (occurring by lysis inside the blood vessels) hemolytic anemia using the urinary hemosiderin test . In general, red cell–intrinsic and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia are extravascular, whereas microangiopathic, infection-associated, and chemical-induced hemolytic anemias are intravascular . Figures 1 and 2 provide practical information to investigate the specific cause of either intravascular  or extravascular  hemolysis. Further elaboration on hemolytic anemia, including immune hemolytic anemia, enzymopathies, and hemoglobinopathies, is beyond the scope of this review.\n\n【42】However, it is important to note that the possibility of a drug-induced mechanism always should be considered in any hemolytic process.\n\n【43】Table 2 Differentiating Intravascular From Extravascular Hemolysis\n\n|  | Hemolytic anemias |\n| --- | --- |\n| Test | All types | Intravascular | Extravascular |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Reticulocyte count | Increased | Increased | Increased |\n| Lactate dehydrogenase | Increased | Increased | Increased |\n| Indirect bilirubin | Increased or normal | Increased | Increased or normal |\n| Haptoglobin | Decreased | Decreased | Decreased |\n| Urinary hemosiderin | Present or absent | Present | Absent |\n\n【45】Figure 1 Evaluation of intravascular hemolysis.

G6PD = glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.\n\n【47】### Step 2. Normocytic Anemia Not Associated With Nutritional Deficiency, Renal Insufficiency, or Hemolysis\n\n【48】The primary consideration in normocytic anemia not associated with nutritional deficiency, renal insufficiency, or hemolysis is either ACD or a primary bone marrow disorder; differentiating between the two is not always easy. Obviously, the patient's history is critical for differentiation and for excluding other causes of normocytic anemia, including drug effect, alcoholism, radiation therapy, chemical exposure, and recent trauma or surgery. The presence of comorbid conditions, an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and an unremarkable peripheral blood smear study support the diagnosis of ACD.\n\n【49】#### Anemia of Chronic Disease\n\n【50】Anemia of chronic disease is usually normocytic but can be microcytic. Current understanding suggests a cytokine-mediated process that inhibits red blood cell production or interferes with erythropoietin production and/or function. Anemia of chronic disease, frequently associated with diabetes mellitus, connective tissue disease, chronic infections, and malignancy, may be mistaken for IDA because low serum iron and decreased transferrin saturation are seen in both conditions. Therefore, serum ferritin is the single best noninvasive test to differentiate IDA from ACD.\n\n【51】The diagnosis of iron deficiency in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and anemia: an algorithm using simple laboratory measures.\n\n【52】#### Anemia Due to Primary Bone Marrow Disorder\n\n【53】The peripheral blood smear is most helpful in providing clues for the presence of a primary bone marrow disease. In myelodysplastic syndrome, for example, the RDW often is increased, and the smear may show the presence of oval macrocytes, hyposegmented neutrophils (pseudo-Pelger-Huët anomaly), or monocytosis. In bone marrow infiltrating processes such as MMM and bone marrow involvement with metastatic cancer, nucleated red blood cells and immature myeloid cells are noted. Red blood cell rouleaux formation may be seen in multiple myeloma. Severe anemia associated with an exremely low reticulocyte count suggests pure red cell aplasia or aplastic anemia. Finally, a primary bone marrow disease often is associated with both quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of white blood cells and platelets.\n\n【54】The physician deciding whether to obtain a bone marrow biopsy should consider the likelihood of discovering a primary bone marrow disease and the therapeutic and prognostic value of the information derived from the procedure. For example, performing a bone marrow biopsy in an elderly patient with mild anemia is unnecessary, even if the peripheral blood smear suggests a primary hematologic disease because the results may not affect overall management decisions. In contrast, a younger patient with a history of chemotherapy or an abnormal peripheral blood smear should undergo bone marrow biopsy before a diagnosis of ACD is established.\n\n【55】MACROCYTIC ANEMIA\n-----------------\n\n【56】### Step 1. Rule Out the Presence of Drugs That Cause Macrocytosis\n\n【57】To evaluate macrocytic anemia, the first step is to exclude substance (alcohol) or drug (hydroxyurea, methotrexate, trimethoprim, zidovudine, 5-fluorouracil) use associated with macrocytosis. Among the offenders, hydroxyurea is the most notorious and induces the largest increases in MCV (oval macrocytosis >110 fL). A lesser degree of macrocytosis (100-110 fL) may result from use of zidovudine (oval macrocytosis), chemotherapy (oval macrocytosis), or alcohol (round macrocytosis).\n\n【58】### Step 2. Rule Out Nutritional Causes of Macrocytic Anemia\n\n【59】In patients with macrocytosis, vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> and/or folate deficiencies must be ruled out.\n\n【60】In folate deficiency, serum folate levels are usually low. However, because recent dietary changes may affect the serum folate level, red blood cell folate levels are sometimes used to document chronic folate deficiency (red blood cells acquire folate at birth, and the cellular concentration does not change during their life span). Because red blood cell folate assays are not precise, the serum homocysteine level may be used instead to evaluate folate deficiency. (The serum homocysteine level is increased during folate deficiency due to impaired folate-dependent conversion of homocysteine to methionine.) A normal homocysteine level makes the diagnosis of folate deficiency extremely unlikely.\n\n【61】In vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency, serum vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> levels are usually low. However, vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> levels may be spuriously low during pregnancy, in elderly patients, and in patients with low white blood cell counts. In these instances and in patients with borderline-low vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> levels, a more sensitive and highly specific test is the measurement of serum methylmalonic acid level (vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> cofactor activity is required to convert methylmalonyl coenzyme A to succinyl coenzyme A). A normal level makes the diagnosis of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency extremely unlikely.\n\n【62】However, an increased serum methylmalonic acid level is not specific to vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency and can be seen in renal insufficiency or as a result of an inborn metabolic disorder.\n\n【63】Once vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency is confirmed, the next step is to determine the cause. The initial test is to screen for the presence of intrinsic factor antibodies; if they are present, a working diagnosis of pernicious anemia is made, and additional testing may be unnecessary. Otherwise, the Schilling test is performed to help differentiate pernicious anemia from primary intestinal malabsorptive disorders (tropical sprue and celiac sprue, inflammatory bowel disease, amyloidosis, and intestinal lymphoma) .\n\n【64】Table 3 Schilling Test\n\n| --- |\n\n【66】### Step 3. Evaluating Non–Drug Induced, Nonnutritional Macrocytic Anemia\n\n【67】If neither vitamin deficiency nor drug (including ethyl alcohol) exposure can be implicated in a macrocytic process, it might be helpful to subclassify the process into mild (MCV, 100-110 fL) or marked (MCV, >110 fL) macrocytosis. Marked macrocytosis that is not secondary to either nutritional deficiency or drug effect almost always is associated with a primary bone marrow disease (eg, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, pure red cell aplasia, or large granular lymphocyte disorder), and a bone marrow biopsy is indicated if the specific hematologic diagnosis affects management decisions. However, with mild macrocytosis it is important to obtain detailed information from the peripheral blood smear before proceeding to bone marrow biopsy. For example, substantial polychromasia (indicative of reticulocytosis) suggests hemolysis as the cause of macrocytosis, whereas round morphology of red blood cells, as opposed to oval macrocytosis, suggests liver disease (target cells are also evident) or hypothyroidism.\n\n【68】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【69】The guidelines outlined in this review may not be used effectively when the patient has either a recent history of red blood cell transfusion or multiple medical problems. The latter is especially true regarding hospitalized patients. These confounding factors must be considered during the process of anemia investigation. Reference to previous laboratory records may provide the most cost-effective clarification.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Not all numerical sets abide by this law; however, for those that do, diversions indicate data modifications including potentially malicious behaviors such as using fraudulent data.\n\n【3】It was previously shown that incidence of cancer follows NBL, but it is unknown whether survival data in cancer registries abide by this law; therefore, we sought to investigate that using a large national cancer database in the United States.\n\n【4】Basic demographic and survival data for all patients with the following hematologic malignancies—acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), multiple myeloma (MM), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), and follicular lymphoma (FL)—diagnosed between 1975 and 2016 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database. Survival time is reported in months. Patients with missing survival data or follow-up less than 1 month were excluded. Patients with each disease were divided into 9 groups based on the first digit of their overall survival numerical value. Pearson’s correlation coefficient (Pearson’s _r_ <sup><em>2 </em></sup> ) was used to quantify the concordance between the distribution of first digits of the survival time (in months), and Newcomb-Benford law predicted percentages. Statistical analyses were done using Statistical Software for Social Sciences, version 24. Institutional Review Board approval was not required, as SEER provides deidentified patient records.\n\n【5】A total of 455,229 patients were included in the final analysis. At a median follow-up of 119 months, 278,629 patients had died. The distribution of the first digits of the survival time in all of our selected diseases followed NBL . Concordance by Pearson’s _r_ <sup><em>2 </em></sup> between the observed digits distribution in our data set and that predicted by NBL for any numerical series that abide was high (AML = 0.99, CML = 0.97, DLBCL = 0.95, FL = 0.93, HL = 0.97, MM = 1.00; scale of 0 to 1, in which 1 indicates higher concordance). In the 228,975 patients with lymphoma in whom staging data (using the Ann Arbor staging system) were available, a similar concordant pattern was seen, as shown in the Figure (B).\n\n【6】Figure Distribution of first digits obeys Newcomb-Benford law in all evaluated diseases.

B, Distribution stratified by Ann Arbor stage in patients with lymphoma.\n\n【7】To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that registry-based survival data in the most common hematologic malignancies do follow NBL. As mentioned previously, in numerical sets that abide by NBL, deviations indicate nonrandom data modifications. These modifications can be fraudulent or could be resulting from human error in data maintenance or effects of an external agent not related to the data itself (perhaps the effects of a certain therapy on survival). Nevertheless, NBL is an easy and simple way to evaluate quality of survival data.

{"seq_id": "34a3e315-e644-48c0-87e1-eef3f11fe340", "title": "Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Reduction and Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease", "text": "【0】Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Reduction and Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease\nreviews and evaluates the evidence supporting a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target of less than 100 mg/dL for moderately high-risk individuals and concludes by saying, “The current evidence supports a strategy of early and aggressive lowering of LDL-C levels for the primary prevention of CAD \\[coronary artery disease\\].” Al Badarin et al review the published literature on the effect of LDL-C by cholesterol absorption transport inhibition with ezetimibe. They conclude correctly that even though ezetimibe lowers LDL-C levels, reduces circulating inflammatory biomarkers like high-sensitivity C-reactive protein when added to statins, and has a variable effect on endothelial function based on a few small studies, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) has shown evidence of its impact on prevention of cardiovascular events.\n\n【1】However, the neutral results of the somewhat infamous ENHANCE (Ezetimibe and Simvastatin in Hypercholesterolemia Enhances Atherosclerosis Regression) carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT) trial\n\n【2】Simvastatin with or without ezetimibe in familial hypercholesterolemia .\n\n【3】has led some to question the cardiovascular benefits of ezetimibe and the LDL-C hypothesis in general. Therefore, it is important to review this controversy and LDL-C lowering in context, especially as it relates to the primary prevention of CVD.\n\n【4】Although reducing LDL-C levels to decrease CVD risk has come of age in the past 2 decades, in an era dominated by drugs that inhibit the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (“statins”), it is worthwhile to recall how we arrived at current treatment guidelines because increasing evidence shows that history is being either forgotten or distorted.\n\n【5】The current year marks the 25th anniversary of the publication of the landmark National Institutes of Health-sponsored LRC-CPPT (Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial), which became the basis for the first National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP I) guideline\n\n【6】released in 1988. As Steinberg points out in an excellent recent review, the reduction in LDL-C levels to decrease CVD, often referred to as _the lipid hypothesis_ , had been controversial and poorly accepted by mainstream medicine for nearly 40 years, despite an extremely large body of epidemiological, animal, and genetic data and positive results from small RCTs of older, mostly minimally effective drugs. The LRC-CPPT, despite using a somewhat unpleasant-to-ingest bile acid sequestrant (cholestyramine) at a dose of 24 g/d, which achieved a moderate 12.6% greater reduction in LDL-C levels compared with placebo, provided sufficient and convincing evidence that cholestyramine reduced death due to definite coronary heart disease by a relative 24% with a relative 19% decrease in nonfatal myocardial infarction ( _P_ <.05 for primary end point). The LRC-CPPT and NCEP-ATP I stimulated an intensive search for and development of more effective, better tolerated, and safe agents for lowering LDL-C levels, which culminated in the approval of the first statin, lovastatin, in late 1987.\n\n【7】In the early 1990s, 3 more statins were approved, and their rapid acceptance by both clinicians and patients was evidenced by statins becoming one of the largest selling therapeutic agents by the middle of the decade. The predominant use was consistent with ATP I guidelines for the primary prevention of CVD.\n\n【8】In 1994, the first RCT of this new class of agents to lower LDL-C levels was published, demonstrating how effective LDL-C reduction could be in decreasing not only CVD events but also total mortality due to the disease. This secondary prevention trial also focused attention on the greater cost-effectiveness of treating patients with existing CVD, given their substantially higher absolute risk of future events. The 4S (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study)\n\n【9】was followed by numerous additional successful RCTs with a variety of statins and in a variety of patient populations, such that LDL-C reduction has been well established to be the most effective intervention for reducing cardiovascular risk.\n\n【10】This includes all groups studied: primary and secondary prevention, men, women, elderly patients, diabetic patients, those with hypertension, those with moderately elevated LDL-C levels and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values, and most recently those with low LDL-C levels and increased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.\n\n【11】Rosuvastatin to prevent vascular events in men and women with elevated C-reactive protein.\n\n【12】In addition, RCTs have shown that “lower LDL-C is better,” and such trials have driven updated NCEP ATP guidelines in which optimal LDL-C levels in high-risk patients with CVD are now as low as 70 mg/dL.\n\n【13】Implications of recent clinical trials for the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines.\n\n【14】These large, global, and well-conducted RCTs of statins ensured that reducing LDL-C levels became universally accepted as the cornerstone of treatment and the basis for worldwide guidelines for the prevention of CVD.\n\n【15】Implications of recent clinical trials for the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines.\n\n【16】European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice: executive summary.\n\n【17】There was little question after the first major statin trials that the reduction in CVD was related to lipid lowering and was totally consistent and supportive of the lipid hypothesis. However, stimulated by funding from the pharmaceutical industry, in which competition was fierce for market share and was driven mainly by the efficacy of lowering LDL-C levels, manufacturers of less-effective agents for lowering LDL-C levels helped propagate “beyond LDL-C” theories; these theories were that statins reduced CVD events by means other than lipid reduction, often termed _pleotropic effects_ , usually shown in in vitro laboratory studies or small, poorly standardized surrogate marker trials. This belief culminated in an RCT by a pharmaceutical company that was designed to show that more LDL-C reduction with a competitor's statin achieved no greater benefit.\n\n【18】Intensive versus moderate lipid lowering with statins after acute coronary syndromes .\n\n【19】However, the results of that study clearly and convincingly showed otherwise, with additional reduction in CVD events with the drug that lowered LDL-C levels more. Even with this evidence, and perhaps with an even more powerful statin about to be approved, the investigators suggested that the reduced events were due to pleotropic effects of the more efficacious statin. However, the trial was soon followed up with results from another head-to-head RCT, with the same drug at different LDL-C lowering doses,\n\n【20】Intensive lipid lowering with atorvastatin in patients with coronary heart disease and chronic kidney disease: the TNT (Treating to New Targets) study.\n\n【21】which eliminated the pleotropic potential and rein-forced that lower is better. Despite the preponderance of evidence, the importance of LDL-C is being de-emphasized, and these unknown or still unproven pleotropic effects of statins are being highlighted.\n\n【22】Within that environment, the ENHANCE study provided an opportunity for proponents of statin pleotropism or those still skeptical about the lipid hypothesis to once again question the role of LDL-C in CVD prevention. Solely on the basis of ENHANCE, a trial with a flawed design, some critics proposed that the inability of ezetimibe to inhibit atherosclerosis may be due to an off-target effect that negates the benefits of LDL-C lowering, similar to that of oral estrogen and the cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitor drug, torcetrapib. The increase in cardiovascular events observed with these last-mentioned agents is large and robust and can be explained by well-documented mechanisms—oral estrogen and progesterone are prothrombotic,\n\n【23】Randomized trial of estrogen plus progestin for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in postmenopausal women.\n\n【24】whereas torcetrapib increases aldosterone production and substantially raises blood pressure.\n\n【25】By comparison, the pathway by which a cholesterol absorption transport inhibitior such as ezetimibe lowers plasma LDL-C levels is similar to that of statins and bile acid sequestrants. All 3 drug classes lower LDL-C levels by up-regulation of the LDL receptor secondary to hepatic intracellular cholesterol depletion. Thus, ezetimibe is unlikely to have an off-target effect.\n\n【26】A more recent CIMT lipid-lowering trial with a statin alone or in combination with ezetimibe has been reported. The open-label, post hoc SANDS (Stop Atherosclerosis in Native Diabetics Study) aggressively treated patients to a LDL-C target of 70 mg/dL or lower with either high-dose statin or low-dose statin plus ezetimibe; this trial found a significant difference ( _P_ <.0001) in CIMT compared with those treated with low-dose statins to LDL-C levels of 100 mg/dL or lower.\n\n【27】Effects of statin alone versus statins plus ezetimibe on carotid atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes: the SANDS (Stop Atherosclerosis in Native Diabetics Study) trial.\n\n【28】Evidence from the 2 studies involving ezetimibe, ENHANCE (which had numerous design flaws) and SANDS (a small post hoc substudy), certainly shows no harm or trend to harm in CVD events, and both suggest a benefit associated with continued use of the drug, consistent with the well-proven LDL-C hypothesis. In response to any concerns that may have arisen on how to proceed in clinical practice, the Food and Drug Administration recently issued a statement after extensive review of the ENHANCE study, reporting, in part, “Based on current available data, patients should not stop taking Vytorin or other cholesterol-lowering medications.” The definitive IMPROVE-IT\n\n【29】(Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial), randomizing 18,000 patients with acute coronary syndrome and comparing simvastatin with or without ezetimibe, is currently under way with completion planned for 2012. The study will determine whether an LDL-C level of approximately 50 mg/dL with the combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin can reduce CVD events compared with an LDL-C level of approximately 70 mg/dL with simvastatin alone.\n\n【30】However, the controversy surrounding ezetimibe serves as a reminder to those focused on preventing CVD that, despite overwhelming evidence, the LDL-C hypothesis and “lower is better” are still not universally accepted. Although statins undoubtedly have antiatherosclerotic benefits, the idea of conferring pleotropic effects to statins vs reducing LDL-C levels distracts many clinicians from following current guidelines and aggressively lowering LDL-C levels. Thus far, LDL-C, or its closely associated components such as apolipoprotein B, remains the most specific and modifiable biomarker for reducing coronary heart disease, irrespective of the status of the patient's risk. Statin therapy, as low as $5 a month for any dose of generic simvastatin, should therefore remain the cornerstone treatment for preventing CVD. This low price for a 40% to 45% reduction in LDL-C levels makes primary prevention, even in low-risk patients, cost-effective. Clinicians have the option, at essentially no added financial burden to patients, of dose titration to higher and more aggressive doses to achieve the appropriate LDL-C goals. However, doubling a statin dose only reduces LDL-C levels an average of 6%, and the potential for increased adverse events with higher statin doses makes clinicians reluctant to use the highest doses of any statin. Thus, combined therapy with other medications known to enhance LDL-C reduction (eg, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and niacin) remains an important option in clinical practice.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Numerous café-au-lait spots were found across the trunk. The patient had previously undergone surgery 4 times during recent 10 years and had been diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) based on clinical symptoms and histopathological results. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive inhomogeneous signal intensity masses consisting of multiple flow void vascular structures. Computed tomography angiography  revealed multiple enlarged, mesh-like vascular malformations, involving popliteal and femoral arteries draining into the popliteal and femoral veins. The patient underwent surgical resection under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. A fusiform incision centered in the masses was made. Surgical findings revealed affluent nourishing vessels of subcutaneous and deep soft tissue and extensive grayish black tissues, with local necrosis and cystic degeneration. Peripheral tissues were separated, and the masses were completely resected. Pathological examination confirmed neurofibromatosis, with some areas transformed into a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor.\n\n【1】Figure A, Clinical aspect of elephantiasis neuromatosa. B, Computed tomography angiography revealed enhanced vessels suggestive of multiple vascular malformations of the left leg.\n\n【2】Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a rare autosomal dominant disease, which is characterized by multiple neurofibromas and pigmented lesions. Eight percent to 15% of patients with NF-1 have a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor during their lifetime. Abnormal soft tissue hypertrophy and deformed masses growing along the length of nerves can occur and affect surrounding tissues such as skin and muscle. This condition is termed _elephantiasis neuromatosa_ , which can cause changes in the vascular and lymphatic system.\n\n【3】Although no more than 40 cases of elephantiasis neuromatosa are described in the literature, the real incidence is estimated to be higher. Vascular abnormalities are a well-recognized manifestation of NF-1. The renal artery is the most frequent site of involvement.

Kent et al describe an electronic health record (EHR)-compatible model that assesses the individual risk for diabetes and how such an assessment may aid in deciding where preventive interventions may be especially warranted. As discussed by Kent et al, their study was predicated on the following considerations. First, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) Study clearly established the efficacy of either lifestyle modification or metformin in reducing the risk of occurrence of type 2 diabetes (Knowler WC et al, Reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle interventions or metformin. _NEJM._ 2002;346(6):393-403). However, the risk of occurrence of type 2 diabetes varies markedly in prediabetic subjects. Uncertainty thus surrounds which patients would benefit from preventive interventions, the latter less likely to be valuable in low-risk patients. Second, there are relevant issues as regards preventive interventions: intensive lifestyle modifications require health care resources and patient compliance, while the use of metformin may be attended by significant side effects. Third, extrapolation of findings from randomized clinical trials to patients in the “real world” may be challenged by heterogeneity in this patient population and in their response to treatment. Kent et al used the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (OLDW) observational database to develop and validate a risk prediction model based on 11 variables (age, sex, race, smoking, BMI, hypertension, systolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and HgbA1c); the predicted 3-year rates for diabetes faithfully correlated with observed rates. The OLDW model was then applied to the DPP data, with the following notable results: The effect of lifestyle modification was comparable across all risk groups on the relative scale, whereas the treatment effect of metformin increased as risk increased; the 3-year predicted risk of developing diabetes was 9.0%, 6.0%, and 3.9% for usual care, metformin therapy, and lifestyle modification, respectively; and either lifestyle modification or metformin prevented more than 50% or 70%, respectively, of preventable diabetic cases in the highest risk quartile of patients. This analysis and modeling by Kent et al are important and timely, especially as they culminated in a valuable EHR-compatible tool. This SMART app automatically predicts individual risk for type 2 diabetes; it identifies those high-risk patients for whom preventive intervention would likely interrupt the development of type 2 diabetes; and it promotes shared decision making with prediabetic patients regarding the prudent course of their management.\n\n【3】Vigorous Physical Activity and the Risk of Primary Cardiac Arrest\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】The health benefits of physical activity are indisputable and diverse, ranging widely from reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality to salutary effects on irritable bowel disease and depression. However, still to be fully resolved are such issues as the level of physical activity that exerts the optimal beneficial effects, the nature of the relationship between health benefits and a graded increase in physical activity, and the clearly troubling one whether too much physical activity may prove damaging, indeed, fatal. As regards the latter, vigorous physical activity has been linked, albeit relatively rarely, to sudden cardiac arrest. The study by Jin et al addresses such issues using primary cardiac arrest (PCA) as the primary outcome. These authors utilized the Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort database; this database includes a National Health Screening dataset that compiled data on questionnaire-derived physical activity. Physical activity was estimated as a metabolic equivalent task (MET) and ranked as 7 levels of increasing activity (MET-hour/week) that reflected multiples of the World Health Organization (WHO) and United States recommended minimum physical activity/week (7.5 MET-hour/week or 150 minutes/week of moderate intensity or 75 minutes/week of vigorous intensity). The data obtained from more than a half million participants in this screening program from 2009 to 2014 demonstrate the following key findings: 1) Compared with inactivity, physical activity was associated with less PCA, with beneficial effects discerned at levels of physical activity below the recommended minimum of 7.5 MET-hour/week and at all seven levels of activity, including physical activity greater than 37.5 MET-hour/week; 2) These associations generally held true, irrespective of age, sex, BMI, and relevant comorbidities; 3) Maximal benefit was observed with physical activity in the range of 15.0 to <22.5 MET-hour/week; 4) PCA was not increased when physical activity was ≥ 37.5 MET-hour/week, irrespective of lifestyle risk factors or cardiovascular disease and 5) Increased physical activity associated with diminished all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. These findings are important and reassuring because they underscore the beneficial effects of physical activity and they demonstrate that the highest levels of physical activity in this study were not associated with an increased risk for PCA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Her symptoms had started 2 days before transfer to our facility with a worsening daily headache. The headache was located in the right frontotemporal region and associated with nausea and vomiting. She described the headache as a continuous ache with intermittent throbbing but no associated aura, photophobia, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, or jaw pain. For several days before the onset of symptoms, she had intermittent fever with a maximum temperature of 39.0°C (reference range, 36.0°C-38.0°C), rigors, generalized malaise, light-headedness, and myalgias. She did not have diplopia, blurry vision, dysarthria, paresthesias, productive cough, wheezing, dyspnea, urinary urgency or frequency, dysuria, abdominal pain, loose stools, or any incontinence. A central line had not been placed at the outside facility.\n\n【1】The patient's medical history was notable for untreated hypertension, Bell palsy, and anemia. She was a native of the Ivory Coast and had traveled to Togo and Ghana before arriving in the United States to visit her son 3 months previously. She had no pets, did not consume undercooked meats, and did not take any medications.\n\n【2】On admission, vital signs were notable for a temperature of 37.6°C, a regular pulse rate of 86 beats/min, blood pressure of 152/89 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, and normal oxygen saturation while breathing ambient air. Physical examination findings were notable for a mildly erythematous oropharynx and scleral icterus; there was no lymphadenopathy or neck stiffness, and Kernig and Brudzinski signs were absent. Laboratory studies yielded the following notable findings (reference ranges provided parenthetically): white blood cell count of 8.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (3.5-10.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with a normal differentiation and platelet count of 83 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (150-450 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). The total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (≤1.2 mg/dL) with a conjugated fraction of 0.3 mg/dL (0.0-0.3 mg/dL). Results of an electrolyte panel and liver function studies were otherwise normal. The patient underwent chest radiography, which revealed no consolidations. Urinalysis results were normal. Testing for serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin was negative.\n\n【3】Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a 6-mm left ophthalmic internal carotid artery aneurysm and a possible cavernous sinus meningioma on the right. On hospital day 2, the patient was scheduled for endovascular treament of the aneurysm, but the development of a fever (temperature, 39.4°C) prompted us to cancel the procedure.\n\n【4】*   1.\n\n【5】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ explanation for this patient's fever?**\n\n【6】    *   a.\n\n【7】        Lower respiratory tract infection\n\n【8】    *   b.\n\n【9】        Urinary tract infection\n\n【10】    *   c.\n\n【11】        Central line–associated infection\n\n【12】    *   d.\n\n【13】        Tropical illness\n\n【14】    *   e.\n\n【15】        Liver abscess\n\n【16】Lower respiratory tract infection is unlikely because the patient did not have respiratory symptoms and no abnormalities were noted on chest radiography. She had no signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection and no history of central line placement. Because the patient is from West Africa, she is at risk of acquiring a tropical illness, which is the most likely diagnosis. Tropical illnesses encountered in West Africa include Ebola, typhoid or enteric fever, yellow fever, dengue fever, malaria, schistosomiasis, and chikungunya. In a patient with liver abscess, fever is typically accompanied by abdominal pain and elevated levels on liver function tests. The patient did not have this presentation.\n\n【17】Further infectious work-up including urine culture, throat culture, rapid _Streptococcus_ test, influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR), QuantiFERON-TB Gold tuberculosis test, and serologies for dengue virus, _Toxoplasma_ , _Cryptococcus_ antigen, _Histoplasma_ , _Coccidioides_ , and human immunodeficiency virus yielded negative results. Blood culture results were also negative. In the hospital, the patient's fever was treated with acetaminophen.\n\n【18】*   2.\n\n【19】    **At this time, which _one_ of the following is the _best_ next step?**\n\n【20】    *   a.\n\n【21】        PCR for Ebola\n\n【22】    *   b.\n\n【23】        Test for yellow fever–specific IgM\n\n【24】    *   c.\n\n【25】        Thick and thin blood smears for malaria\n\n【26】    *   d.\n\n【27】        Test for dengue-specific IgM\n\n【28】    *   e.\n\n【29】        Test for chikungunya-specific IgM\n\n【30】Ebola is included in the differential diagnosis given that the patient is from West Africa. Ebola is a viral illness spread from person to person via contact with contaminated blood or bodily fluids up to 21 days after exposure. Symptoms include fever, headache, myalgias, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and, in some cases, hemorrhage.\n\n【31】Our patient has been away from home for 3 months. To date, there have been no cases of Ebola in the Ivory Coast, although it shares a border with Guinea and Liberia where there has been an outbreak. Therefore, she is not likely to have Ebola and will not benefit from PCR testing of the blood. There have been outbreaks of yellow fever in the Ivory Coast, and because of this, yellow fever vaccine is recommended for travelers to this country. Illness begins 3 to 6 days after a bite from an infected mosquito. Symptoms include fever, myalgias, headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Following symptom remission, some patients have progression to a toxic phase that manifests with organ dysfunction and hemorrhage.\n\n【32】Our patient has been away from the endemic region for 90 days, much longer than the incubation period for yellow fever, and is unlikely to have this disease. Conversely, malaria can manifest months or even years after initial exposure, especially if one was previously exposed and developed partial immunity or received prophylaxis. Thick and thin blood smear for malaria is the criterion standard for diagnosis and is the most appropriate step at this time.\n\n【33】The thick film concentrates the parasites and increases diagnostic sensitivity. Nonimmune individuals may be symptomatic at very low parasite densities that initially may be undetectable by blood smear. In such cases, the smear should be repeated every 12 to 24 hours for 3 sets.\n\n【34】Dengue fever, also known as “break-bone fever,” is a mosquito-borne viral illness associated with urban environments and manifests with fever, severe headache with retro-orbital pain, and severe myalgias and arthralgias, The incubation period is several days.\n\n【35】Given that the patient has been out of the endemic area for a longer period of time, it is unlikely that she has dengue fever. Chikungunya is another mosquito-borne illness included in the differential diagnosis. Similar to dengue fever, it is associated with urban environments; the incubation period is a few days, and the illness is characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain.\n\n【36】Our patient is unlikely to have chikungunya because she has been out of the endemic area for longer than just a few days.\n\n【37】A blood parasite smear revealed parasitemia with 0.5% of cells infected with _Plasmodium_ that was confirmed by PCR as _Plasmodium falciparum_ .\n\n【38】*   3.\n\n【39】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _best_ treatment option for a patient who did not take malaria prophylaxis?**\n\n【40】    *   a.\n\n【41】        Chloroquine\n\n【42】    *   b.\n\n【43】        Atovaquone-proguanil\n\n【44】    *   c.\n\n【45】        Artesunate\n\n【46】    *   d.\n\n【47】        Intravenous quinidine gluconate plus doxycycline\n\n【48】    *   e.\n\n【49】        Exchange transfusion\n\n【50】The treatment choice depends on the malaria species, the clinical status of the patient, and the drug susceptibility of the infecting parasites as determined by the geographic area where the infection was acquired and the previous use of antimalarial medicines.\n\n【51】The initial decision is whether the patient has _P falciparum_ malaria or malaria due to _Plasmodium vivax_ , _Plasmodium ovale_ , _Plasmodium malariae_ , or _Plasmodium knowlesi_ . _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _P knowlesi_ infections can cause rapidly progressive severe illness or death, whereas the other species are less likely to have severe manifestations. Also, _P vivax_ and _P ovale_ infections require treatment for the hypnozoite forms that remain dormant in the liver and can cause relapsing infection.\n\n【52】Subsequent treatment decisions are based on classification of the disease as severe (ie, having end-organ damage) or uncomplicated. Uncomplicated disease is treated with oral antimalarial medications, and severe disease is treated with intravenous antimalarials. Our patient had no evidence of end-organ damage including impaired consciousness, hemoglobin level of less than 7 mg/dL, renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypotension, acidosis, and/or parasitemia with 5% or more of cells infected. The patient had uncomplicated _P falciparum_ malaria. Although she had headache, there was no suspicion for cerebral malaria, which is a manifestation of severe malaria presenting with end-organ damage including alteration in consciousness. Further, the choice of antimalarial is based on the origin of the disease, the susceptibility of the malaria species, and the adverse effects, availability, and cost of the medication.\n\n【53】In general, _P falciparum_ malaria acquired anywhere with the exception of the Caribbean, Central America west of the Panama Canal, and most of the Middle East is chloroquine resistant. Non– _P falciparum_ malaria is susceptible to chloroquine, but resistance is increasing in Indonesia, Oceania, and Peru. In this patient, _P falciparum_ malaria was acquired in West Africa. Chloroquine would not be a good choice because the organism would most likely be resistant to it. Atovaquone-proguanil is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated _P falciparum_ malaria in the United States and hence is the most appropriate treatment for this patient.\n\n【54】In most of the world, artemisinin combination therapies are first-line treatment for _P falciparum_ , but this is not the case in the United States because of low availability. For cases of severe malaria, intravenous artesunate should be used over intravenous quinine or quinidine because of markedly reduced parasitemia and risk of death when compared head-to-head.\n\n【55】In the United States, quinidine is used more often because it is more readily available than artemisinin derivatives. Doxycycline is used only in combination with artesunate or quinine as second-line therapy. The evidence for exchange blood transfusions in severe malaria is anecdotal, and no comparative trials have established efficacy.\n\n【56】In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) performed an analysis of exchange transfusion as an adjunct to antimalarial drugs for treatment of severe malaria and concluded that it did not affect survival.\n\n【57】As a result of this analysis, the CDC no longer recommends this treatment.\n\n【58】Our patient was treated with atovaquone-proguanil in the hospital. She tolerated the medication well. Her fever subsided, and her headache and nausea improved. The aneurysm was determined to be stable and did not require immediate intervention.\n\n【59】*   4.\n\n【60】    **Which _one_ of the following tests should be performed _next_ ?**\n\n【61】    *   a.\n\n【62】        Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing\n\n【63】    *   b.\n\n【64】        Hemoglobin electrophoresis\n\n【65】    *   c.\n\n【66】        Repeated thick and thin blood smear\n\n【67】    *   d.\n\n【68】        No additional testing\n\n【69】    *   e.\n\n【70】        PCR testing for drug resistance\n\n【71】Testing for G6PD is not indicated in this case because patients with G6PD deficiency experience hemolytic anemia from use of primaquine or fluoroquinolones, which our patient has not received. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is helpful in diagnosing sickle cell disease or thalassemia, conditions that are protective against malaria. Thick and thin blood smear remains the criterion standard for diagnosing malaria, but there is no indication to repeat the smear once the diagnosis is established, especially in uncomplicated cases unless the patient has a relapse. In patients with severe malaria, the clinician may consider repeating daily smears to monitor progress with treatment. No additional testing is required for cases of malaria diagnosed outside the United States. The CDC recommends malaria testing including PCR for confirmation of species and identification of drug-resistant mutations because of the growing resistance to antimalarials and because most of the infections are acquired outside the United States. A PCR test is not done in most areas endemic for malaria because of the high cost and the requirement for a specialized laboratory. Rapid diagnostic tests using _Plasmodium_ antigens are also available for the diagnosis of malaria, but they are less sensitive in low parasitemia and may not be specific for the species. In that case, the smear is necessary for diagnosis.\n\n【72】The patient was discharged from the hospital with a 3-day regimen of atovaquone-proguanil. She followed up with a neurosurgeon for elective coiling of the aneurysm 1 week after completing treatment of the malaria. She remained afebrile and headache free. Following the neurosurgical procedure, she received dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel. The patient planned to return home to the Ivory Coast.\n\n【73】*   5.\n\n【74】    **Which _one_ of the following is recommended to prevent malaria reinfection when the patient returns home to the Ivory Coast?**\n\n【75】    *   a.\n\n【76】        Chloroquine once weekly\n\n【77】    *   b.\n\n【78】        Atovaquone-proguanil once daily\n\n【79】    *   c.\n\n【80】        Bed nets, spraying the house with insecticide, draining stagnant water\n\n【81】    *   d.\n\n【82】        Vaccine\n\n【83】    *   e.\n\n【84】        Intermittent presumptive treatment\n\n【85】Chemoprophylaxis for malaria is recommended for travelers to an endemic area, including expatriates who lose their immunity to malaria after approximately 5 years. Chemoprophylaxis consists of chloroquine once weekly in chloroquine-sensitive areas or atovaquone-proguanil once daily when traveling to areas with chloroquine-resistant malaria. Chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for people living in endemic areas. Because our patient lives in the Ivory Coast, an endemic area, chemoprophylaxis is not recommended. Use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets, spraying the house with insecticide, draining stagnant water, using mosquito repellant on exposed skin and clothing, and avoiding the peak mosquito feeding period of dusk to dawn are measures to decrease mosquito bites and risk of infection with malaria. These measures are recommended for travelers as well as for natives of malaria-endemic regions, such as our patient. Another promising preventive therapy is a malaria vaccine, which is not currently available on the market but is in development.\n\n【86】Intermittent presumptive treatment can be used in high-risk populations (ie, pregnant women and infants) in endemic areas.\n\n【87】Our patient is not in the high-risk group.\n\n【88】Discussion\n----------\n\n【89】Malaria is a major global health problem, with an estimated 207 million cases and 627,000 deaths worldwide in 2012. Malaria is endemic in more than 100 countries, and 3.4 billion individuals are at risk worldwide. Although malaria was eliminated from the United States in the early 1950s, approximately 1500 to 2000 cases of malaria are reported each year, almost exclusively in returned international travelers.\n\n【90】Malaria is transmitted by the female _Anopheles_ mosquito, and infection in humans is caused by 5 protozoan species of the genus _Plasmodium_ — _P falciparum_ , _P vivax_ , _P ovale_ , _P malariae_ , and _P knowlesi_ . Most cases reported in the United States are caused by _P falciparum_ (58%) or _P vivax_ (17%).\n\n【91】Malaria should be part of the differential diagnosis for all patients who present with fever within 1 year after international travel to an endemic area, even if the patient has had previous exposure and developed partial immunity or has received prophylaxis. More than 90% of cases occur within 30 days of exposure.\n\n【92】The differential diagnosis for fever in a returned traveler also includes infections common in nontravelers (urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, community-acquired pneumonia) as well as typhoidal and nontyphoidal salmonellosis, dengue fever, viral hepatitis, and rickettsial infections. Nearly 95% of patients with malaria in the United States report a history of fever, but only half have a fever the day of presentation. Malaria presents with a “cold” stage in which a patient shakes with rigors, followed by a “hot” stage in which the temperature can exceed 40°C, after which the patient sweats and the temperature returns to normal.\n\n【93】Although the fever is traditionally described as occurring in discrete episodes lasting a few hours every 2 to 3 days, the fever can have an irregular pattern throughout the day. Additional symptoms are generally nonspecific and can include headache, malaise, and myalgias. Patients may also report gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea or nausea. The most common physical examination abnormality aside from fever is splenomegaly.\n\n【94】Laboratory abnormalities are generally mild and may include transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia. Patients with _P falciparum_ malaria may decompensate rapidly, and infection with this species is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment, particularly in nonimmune travelers. Complications may include impaired consciousness or coma, seizure, respiratory distress, severe anemia, renal failure, jaundice, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n【95】The criterion standard for diagnosis of malaria is microscopic identification of malaria parasites on Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears. If the initial smear results are negative and malaria is suspected, blood smears should be repeated at 12- to 24-hour intervals for 48 to 72 hours. Other methods of diagnosis include rapid tests and PCR. Patients with malaria should be treated immediately. If a patient's presentation is strongly suggestive of severe malaria and there is a compatible travel history, diagnostic testing should not delay treatment. The optimal treatment regimen varies depending on several factors, including severity, the species of malaria, the likelihood of drug resistance (based on where the infection was acquired), patient age, and pregnancy status. Oral treatment options for uncomplicated malaria include chloroquine (in sensitive areas), atovaquone-proguanil, or artemisinin combinations. Severe malaria—characterized by end-organ damage, hemoglobin level less than 7 mg/dL, parasitemia (>5% infected cells), or acidosis—is treated with intravenous artesunate or quinidine. Pregnant women are treated with mefloquine or quinidine and clindamycin for uncomplicated malaria.

Survey respondents were randomly assigned to vignettes that varied the physician specialty with COI. The primary outcome was mean difference in Mayer Trust, and the secondary outcome included the proportion who desire to discontinue care.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】There were 1729 of 1920 respondents who completed the experiment (90.1% completion rate). Respondents were male (52.5%; n=907), white (71.4%; n=1234), and between the ages of 25 and 44 years (70.9%; n=1227). Mean ± SD Mayer Trust across the 6 specialties was 3.7±.60, with the only between-specialty differences observed for psychiatry compared with the other specialties ( _F_ \\=5.4; _P_ <.001). The median dollar amount that would affect respondents’ trust in a physician was $5000 (interquartile range, $100-$100,000). A total of 75.1% (n=1298) of respondents desired COI information, with 41.6% (n=720) discontinuing care. Age older than 34 years (adjusted odds ratio \\[aOR\\], 0.7; 95%, CI, 0.49-0.99; _P_ \\=.047), nonwhite race (aOR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.02-1.6; _P_ \\=.03), educational attainment of 4 or more years of college (aOR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.05-1.6; _P_ \\=.016), and physician specialty as a psychiatrist (aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.03-2.2; _P_ \\=.034) were predictors for discontinuing care.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Public COI disclosure is a common method for managing financial conflicts. Although survey respondents were more likely to discontinue care with a physician with COI, they will act on this knowledge of COI differently depending on the specialty of the physician. The finding that psychiatry is an outlier may be a chance finding that warrants further confirmation.

{"seq_id": "c4f44123-b05d-4593-8b78-447514f10976", "title": "Vaccination Safety", "text": "【0】Vaccination Safety\nVaccines have formed a rare bright spot in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid and successful deployment of several new vaccines offers a way out of this crisis, now threatened more by vaccine hesitancy than anything else. Unfortunately, recent reports of thromboembolic (TE) events with both adenoviral vector vaccines, cerebral venous sinus thrombus (CVST) with Johnson and Johnson/Janssen (JJ) vaccine, and other clotting concerns with the Oxford AstraZeneca (AZ) may amplify vaccine hesitancy.\n\n【1】The CDC has recommended a “pause” to the roll out of the JJ vaccine to thoroughly investigate a small number of cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) events (6) in women between the ages of 18 and 48, 6 to 13 days after vaccination.\n\n【2】To date, these are the first reported TE complications attributed to the vaccine, despite the administration of nearly 7 million doses. Additional analysis and review also found laboratory work consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) in these patients. Details about these events are scarce, as more in-depth review by manufacturers and authorizing agencies to further investigate this suspected association begins.\n\n【3】If these events are as rare as currently reported, this would be consistent with a generally safe vaccine with very rare side effects. However, the larger concern with this pause is that these represent the tip of the iceberg, with more cases or similar pathology going unrecognized. We reviewed the >7000 patients who were vaccinated with the JJ vaccine within the Mayo Clinic for newly recorded thrombotic complications of any kind in the electronic medical record. Although this number is small, if there were a significant risk of thrombotic complications that was going unseen, we may see evidence of unprovoked events. To understand a baseline rate of complications to be expected after a routine vaccination, we also extracted the same set of 30-day new-onset thrombotic complications from all patients who received influenza vaccines from April 1, 2018, to April 1, 2021 (approximately 361,000 patients).\n\n【4】Serious TE events were seen in 7 cases. Five were pulmonary emboli and deep vein thrombosis, and the other 2 were non-CVST thrombotic complications. All these events were in some way provoked and related to an underlying etiology fulfilling the Virchow triad: that is, venous stasis, activation of blood coagulation, and vein damage.\n\n【5】In recent large-scale studies reviewing more than 500,000 COVID-19 infections, the risk of CVST is 39 in 1 million cases, 2 weeks from infection.\n\n【6】Compared with this, European agencies have estimated that risk of CVST following the AZ vaccine is approximately 5 per million doses.\n\n【7】In our population, the observed rate of all-cause 30-day thrombotic complications was lower than observed in the past 3 years of influenza vaccinations 0.32 (95% confidence interval, 0.17 to 0.69). The influenza data are a crude all-cause thrombosis measure, and although there is likely an artifact related to the small number of JJ vaccines, it is reassuring to see an event rate lower than “background.”\n\n【8】In addition, the relative risk of venous thromboembolism with smoking in the general population per various studies is anywhere between 1.3 and 3.3.\n\n【9】The association of smoking with venous thrombosis in women: a population-based, case-control study.\n\n【10】Current and former smoking and risk for venous thromboembolism: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【11】Studies also estimate that the risk of venous thromboembolism in women with current oral contraceptive pill users is 3-fold compared with those not exposed to oral contraceptive pills.\n\n【12】Risk of acute thromboembolic events with oral contraceptive use: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【13】Close to 7 million doses of the JJ vaccine have been administered, of which only 6 documented cases of TE events have been observed. Further in-depth review of these cases is needed to ascertain if causality with the administration of vaccine can be established or if these patients had alternative etiologies for having these events. However, if current numbers hold, the risk from the JJ vaccine is lower than oral contraceptives, smoking, and—perhaps most notably—symptomatic COVID-19 infection itself. The single-dose vaccine regimen and less stringent storage requirements make the JJ vaccine a critical tool in the fight against COVID-19. Although stringent monitoring of vaccine safety is critical, we must be careful to not contribute to vaccine hesitancy by conveying impressions of excess risk where it has not been established. More targeted approaches to restricting the vaccine during investigations—such as pausing for women of childbearing age, the only group with any demonstrated risk—would have been more appropriate. Rapid review of any and every adverse event, communication to the public, and return to use of the vaccine is critical to getting back on track.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Advocates\n\n【1】Fostering accountable care: moving forward in Medicare.\n\n【2】and Administration officials alike repeatedly emphasized the centrality of population-based coordinated care and incentive realignment with risk bearing and sharing so that health care institutions' financial interests could be linked to the efficient delivery of high-quality care. The PPACA, reflecting its authors' strong desire to jump-start our move away from volume-based payment methods, included an unprecedented new nationwide program, as opposed to a more typical narrowly focused demonstration or pilot project, that offered new payment and quality reporting rules to any set of Medicare-participating physicians and hospitals willing to accept the brave new challenges of accountable care. Participation in how-to conferences and collaboratives spread like wildfire, for it seemed like the movement to full financial and performance risk for a defined patient population was the clear direction American health care policy was moving. But then the initial Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO proposed rule (set of regulations) was released, and enthusiasm turned to disappointment, anger, and a search for viable alternatives.\n\n【3】The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), created by the PPACA to be the catalyst for delivery system reform, as quickly as possible developed an alternative model pilot ACO project, aptly named Pioneer ACO, even as it digested the tsunami of formal comments about how to improve the Shared Savings ACO model proposed rule. The final shared savings rule was far more palatable to most observers, although only 32 and 116 organizations have signed on to become Pioneer and Medicare Shared Savings Program ACOs, respectively, at this point. While they have important differences, both ACO concepts share 3 key features for health care organizations: (1) accept clinical and financial responsibility for a defined group of Medicare beneficiaries, essentially practice population health management, (2) measure and report a wide array of quality metrics, and (3) benefit financially vs baseline if, and only if, quality _and_ cost saving targets are met.\n\n【4】The major difference in the models is the much greater degree of financial risk and reward allowed to and expected of Pioneer ACOs, for they are required to accept population-based payment risk by year 3 for certain Medicare beneficiaries and to have at least 50% of their private payer contracts also be risk based by then, in the hope of spreading the payment innovation to the health care system more generally. It is also worthy of note that the Pioneer pilot is larger than the Medicare Shared Savings Program _._ However, the small number of ACOs in total, after all the discussion during the legislative debate and in the year before the first proposed rule came out, is a disappointing indicator of the reality that most health care organizations are still reluctant to move from fee-for-service to outcomes-based payment without more protection and support.\n\n【5】Patients Are not Necessarily Engaged\n------------------------------------\n\n【6】No one really likes the so-called patient attribution rules, mechanisms for “assigning” patients to the ACO. Shared Savings ACOs must accept retrospective attribution, which means they will not know which patients their performance is being held accountable for until after the fact. This more or less forces them to treat all patients the same, which is arguably good. However, it also risks diluting their ability to bring specific tools and process innovations to bear on patients who could benefit the most since they might be “wasted” on patients for whom it does not matter to their bottom line, and therefore there can be no savings with which to help finance the intervention that produces the savings in the first place. Basic economics has long argued that useful services will be undersupplied to the marketplace if the investor is prevented from reaping the rewards from the investment. In addition, health care institutions' ignorance about which patients will affect a practice's bottom line violates a basic precondition for markets to perform well, that both buyers and sellers have perfect knowledge about the transaction they might enter. Retrospective assignment is simply problematic on both grounds.\n\n【7】Pioneer ACOs have the option of choosing prospective attribution, which means you could at least know which patients your performance is being judged on ahead of time, but the rules prohibit either the ACO or Medicare from doing anything, even providing incentives, to keep the attributed patient “in the network” of the ACO. This means that the ACOs could be penalized (or rewarded) for cost and quality performance that they literally did not contribute to.\n\n【8】One must infer that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI)/CMS/Department of Health and Human Services/Obama Administration basically made a hard judgment call that ACOs—at least in this initial phase—are more appealing to patients if the patients know they can always visit other clinicians and hospitals any time they prefer. That is surely true, but it also means that the models are far less attractive to health care organizations that are naturally fearful of accepting performance risk that they cannot control. The other serious downside of allowing absolute patient choice at all times and with no financial consequences is that it seriously missed an opportunity to test the combined effect of truly engaged patients along with new health care organization incentives. Since it is increasingly clear that for us to get health care cost growth under control, patients are going to have to assume greater responsibility for their own behavior, health, and health improvement and maintenance (through compliance as well as regular attention to diet and exercise), this seems like an omission based more on politics than health care policy. An opportunity was therefore also lost to speak clearly and honestly to the public at large about the responsibilities we must all assume to make our health care system sustainable. Given the slander about “death panels” coming from conservative opponents of reform, the White House judgment call is understandable, but a disappointing one that should be remedied in the next wave of ACO models.\n\n【9】Baylor Health Care System (Dallas, Texas) had a particular problem—ultimately the main reason they did not become a Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO—with the CMMI's refusal to reconsider its insistence that patients be attributed on the basis of the tax identification number of the physician group where most care was delivered rather than on the basis of an identifier for the specific physician who provides the majority of the patient's evaluation and management services. The Baylor modification would be more fair in cases in which some but not all members of a given physician practice are participating ACO physicians. The CMMI method puts the ACO at risk for patients mostly seeing a physician who is manifestly not participating in the ACO activities, risks, and rewards. In trying to force ACOs to recruit more physicians to join, this rule cost the program at least one, and surely more, ACO candidates. Hopefully, different tradeoffs will be operational in the future.\n\n【10】Partners HealthCare (Boston, Massachusetts) was the only organization to express anything positive about the extreme degree of patient choice in both ACO models, for they saw it as removing the stigma of primary care physician as gatekeeper.\n\n【11】They are also the only ACO participant to emphasize the importance of having many specialists involved in the care of patients, which is counter to the approach of limiting specialist access when possible and appropriate. There is, of course, much dispute about where to draw these lines, but Partners' support for the concept validates the other ACOs' and ACO candidates' fear of unfettered patient choice when a more limited set of health care professionals is accountable for overall quality and cost performance they cannot fully control.\n\n【12】Risk-Reward-Investment Tradeoffs Are Hard for CMMI to Calibrate\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The high infrastructure cost of being able to report the requisite quality metrics and to institute the information system plus clinical and financial management tools to improve performance over time were some of the main reasons many organizations decided not to become ACOs. Reducing the number of quality metrics required from 65 to 33 surely helped, as did permitting Shared Savings ACOs to avoid downside risk altogether (if they want to accept lower reward upsides). In addition, permitting the boldest Pioneer ACOs to gain if they reduce cost growth below the target rate _and_ if their level of cost is lower than the fixed population-based payment also encouraged those who believe they can manage risk to enter and adopt the more aggressive risk-reward options. However, the CMMI cannot be a force for quality improvement without demanding far more quality measurement than is the norm today, and Medicare has to keep _some_ of the savings to minimize taxpayer pain in the long run, so it is hard to see how much more it can relax these parameters in not-yet participating institutions' favor.\n\n【14】Long-run Visions of Participants and Nonparticipants Are Remarkably Similar\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】and Health Choice more slowly but about as fast as they think they can, which is faster than many organizations are moving today. The question for all will be, can they find payers willing to move toward value- and performance-based payment at their preferred pace, for without payment reform and aligned incentives among the full range of physicians and hospitals, real-care transformation cannot occur and the goals of more efficient high-quality care and better health will not be realized. Health Choice clearly prefers Medicare Advantage plans to Medicare FFS (fee-for-service) plans as a payer, since those plans can provide actionable data much faster than the CMS. This is clearly a problem that should be remedied as soon as possible.\n\n【16】Interestingly, while all participants hope for short-term success, they also recognize that there are long-term gains to participating regardless of specific captured rewards. Atlantic Health System (Morristown, New Jersey) is already happy to report that many more clinicians than before are energized to work on quality improvement daily.\n\n【17】Ascension Health Partners will use its exemplary Pioneer ACOs—Seton Health Alliance ACO (Austin, Texas) and Genesys Physician Hospital Organization (Flint, Michigan)—to teach the rest of its large system about both medical and financial management as well as strategies for engendering physician engagement around values and shared business goals.\n\n【18】Ascension Health partners with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' to provide patient-centered care through the Pioneer Accountable Care Organization model.\n\n【19】Partners HealthCare is clearly desirous of encouraging specialists to share in the gains from reform and thereby avoid the zero-sum nature of delivery reforms in the 1990s.\n\n【20】This common vision is an important takeaway, for we really do face an urgent task of reining in cost growth as humanely as possible. We must and surely will find a way to put our fiscal house in order. The question is, will the successful way entail large benefit and price cuts and much human suffering or incentive realignments and quality improvements as envisioned in the PPACA and ACO models? Given the direction of Medicare's movement, we are starting to see a groundswell of parallel incentive realignments in the private sector as well—medical homes, bundled payment arrangements, and even full-scale ACOs.\n\n【21】Health plan leadership in delivery system reform (slide presentation) America’s Health Insurance Plans Summit on Shared Accountability.\n\n【22】America’s Health Insurance Plans Coverage Web site , Washington, DC October 18, 2011\n\n【23】These new incentive alignments, like the CMMI ACOs, are just as or more likely to be led by independent physician groups as by integrated health care systems. So the good news is, the practice vision of incentive realignment is starting to spread across the entire and diverse health care sector, not just in pockets of institutions that happen to have highly integrated systems.\n\n【24】However, if the law is repealed next year despite the favorable ruling by the Supreme Court of the United States, many of the tools for incentive realignment, but more importantly the momentum in this triple-aim direction, will have been lost. The Atlantic group explicitly wrote that market forces in New Jersey are not strong enough to produce these incentive realignment tools in the absence of government ACOs. It is hard to see how the movement can continue to overcome the myriad barriers and spread without continued pressure from and the specific example of the largest payer in the country, the Medicare program. While a bare-bones premium support model like US House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) has proposed would exert even more pressure on public-sector health care spending by getting Medicare out of the fee-for-service business, his plan would undermine the potential transformative power Medicare has had as a buyer before (diagnosis-related groups, resource-based relative value scale) and could have again (ACOs, bundled payments, patient-centered medical homes). Post-2012, a bipartisan consensus around ACO-like payment reform could arise, but it's hard to be optimistic about bipartisan anything these days. Therefore, working to retain the useful tools that we have to tame the cost growth beast seems like a prudent aim, even as we also work to learn from, modify, and improve those tools so more clinicians and patients may ultimately benefit from them.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression analyses were performed to assess heart rate as a prognostic marker, both as a continuous variable and after categorization into quintiles. Smooth spline estimates and hazard ratios (HRs) were plotted for 2 age strata (<75 years vs ≥75 years) for each individual heart rate.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 1033 patients were included (766 men \\[74.2%\\]; mean age, 65.1±12.6 years). During a mean follow-up of 4.6±3.3 years (median, 3.8 years \\[25th-75th percentile, 1.9-6.9\\]), 476 patients (46.1%) died. Mortality was associated with a statistically greater heart rate in the total cohort (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.26; _P_ <.001). From a clinical viewpoint, this means an 18% increased risk for every 10-beats/min elevation in heart rate. The same characteristics were present in the relationship between heart rate assessed after 6 months and long-term mortality (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.20-1.42; _P_ <.001). Overall, the prognostic importance of heart rate in ambulatory patients with HF was largely influenced by patient age. Remarkably, in the elderly population (≥75 years), heart rate below 68 beats/min conferred an increased risk of death, whereas in younger patients, mortality exhibited a declining slope at even the lowest heart rates.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Our research, if applicable to the prospective management of patients with ambulatory HF, suggests that patients aged 75 years or older have the best outcomes with target heart rates of 68 beats/min; however, younger patients may benefit from lower heart rates, even below 55 beats/min.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ECG ( electrocardiography ), HF ( heart failure ), HR ( hazard ratio ), LVEF ( left ventricular ejection fraction ), Q1-Q3 ( 25th-75th percentile ), SR ( sinus rhythm )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The authors propose that this patient's hypotension was due to the development of a dynamic LVOT obstruction during the procedure. Although echocardiography was not performed at the time of the patient's symptoms to verify the presence of an LVOT obstruction, some aspects of the patient's presentation are consistent with the presentation of those patients previously described. First, the initial episode of hypotension seemed to resolve after administration of an α-agonist, and hypotension did not recur after the administration of intravenous fluid and β-blocker. In the repeat procedure the patient was treated with a phenylephrine infusion and intermittent esmolol with no recurrence of hypertension. As correctly pointed out by the authors, these measures act to reduce the degree of LVOT obstruction and alleviate hypertension. Second, a transthoracic echocardiogram performed after the patient stabilized showed decreased systolic function with an ejection fraction of 35% with akinesis of the anterior and septal walls from base to apex and no evidence of a dynamic LVOT obstruction. Two days later, the patient underwent coronary angiography during which left ventriculography demonstrated a normal ejection fraction (74%) with no evidence of regional hypokinesis. The patient was shown to have diffuse coronary artery disease and underwent PTCA of the right coronary artery. That the patient's myocardial function recovered within 2 days suggests ischemia as the cause of the LV dysfunction. However, what is not clear is whether the ischemia was a cause of apical akinesis and subsequent basal hyperdynamic function resulting in adynamic LVOT obstruction, or whether an ischemic threshold was achieved during the procedure resulting in a deterioration of global LV function. The second procedure was performed after the patient had undergone PTCA of the right coronary artery as well as with concomitant use of a β-blocker and α-agonist. Thus, it is not clear whether the prevention of a dynamic LVOT obstruction or treatment of the underlying coronary artery disease was responsible for preventing hypotension in the second procedure.\n\n【1】While the above factors are consistent with the development of a dynamic LVOT obstruction as a cause of the patient's symptoms, some are different from the patient we described. The patient presented had very transient episodes of hypotension which in some instances resolved without intervention. In all the patients presented in our series, the hypotension persisted until measures such as administration of β-blockers or α-agonists and discontinuation of afterload reduction were instituted. Additionally, the echocardiogram performed after the procedure describes akinesis of the septum and anterior wall from apex to base, which raises the question of whether this patient would have been able to develop the basal hyperdynamic function necessary to create an LVOT obstruction.\n\n【2】Thus, while it can only be speculated that this patient developed a transient dynamic LVOT obstruction as a cause of her symptoms, Keegan and colleagues make some important points. First, the development of a dynamic LVOT obstruction is known to occur in conditions other than acute coronary syndromes and probably occurs more often than is currently appreciated. Studies addressing the frequency with which this phenomenon occurs are currently lacking and should be pursued. Second, when a patient develops sudden hypotension that cannot be readily explained, this phenomenon should be considered as a cause of the patient's symptoms. Finally, this case demonstrates the value of pursuing emergent transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography in this setting if at all possible, as the diagnosis, with its therapeutic ramifications, can be quickly confirmed or dismissed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The survey was administered online November 6 through December 6, 2019, to a validated panel of HCPs drawn from US national databases and professional organizations. The final analysis sample included 779 primary care clinicians (PCCs) and 159 gastroenterologists (GIs).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】HCPs chose colonoscopy as their preferred screening method for average-risk patients (96.9% (154/159) for GIs, 75.7% (590/779) for PCCs). Among PCCs, 12.2% (95/779) preferred multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA), followed by fecal immunochemical test (FIT), (7.3%; 57/779) and guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) (4.8%; 37/779). Preference among PCCs and GIs generally shifted toward noninvasive screening options for patients who were unable to undergo invasive procedures; concerned about taking time from work; unconvinced about need for screening; and refusing other screening recommendations. Among PCCs, preference for mt-sDNA over FIT and gFOBT was less frequent in larger compared with smaller clinical practices. Additionally, preference for mt-sDNA over FIT was more likely among PCCs with more years of clinical experience, higher patient volumes (> 25/day), and practice locations in suburban and rural settings (compared to urban).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Both PCCs and GIs preferred colonoscopy for CRC screening of average-risk patients, although PCCs did so less frequently and with approximately a quarter preferring stool-based tests (particularly mt-sDNA). PCCs’ preference varied by provider and patient characteristics. Our findings underscore the importance of informed choice and shared decision-making about CRC screening options.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CRC ( colorectal cancer ), FIT ( fecal immunochemical test ), gFOBT ( guaiac-based fecal occult blood test ), HCP ( health care provider ), mt-sDNA ( multi-target stool DNA ), OR ( odds ratio ), PCC ( primary care clinician ), USPSTF ( United States Preventive Services Task Force )\n\n【11】In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death.\n\n【12】Several screening options are endorsed for average-risk CRC screening and have been shown to favorably affect both incidence and mortality outcomes.\n\n【13】Screening for Colorectal Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.\n\n【14】The Healthy People 2020 objective for CRC screening is to increase the proportion of adults aged 50 to 75 years receiving guideline-recommended screening to 70.5%, whereas the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable has set an even more ambitious goal of 80% screening participation in every community.\n\n【15】However, current CRC screening rates remain well below these national goals, with nearly one-third of eligible adults in the United States reportedly not up to date with their recommended CRC screening.\n\n【16】Moreover, reported CRC screening rates are even lower among certain population subgroups, as defined for example by race/ethnicity, younger age, or lower socioeconomic status.\n\n【17】The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening for CRC among average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years.\n\n【18】Screening for Colorectal Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.\n\n【19】USPSTF provides guidance on the use of multiple direct visualization and stool-based/noninvasive screening tests for these patients, including colonoscopy every 10 years; flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years; or flexible sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with annual fecal immunochemical tests (FITs); multitarget stool DNA (mt-sDNA) test every 1 or 3 years; annual FIT; annual guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT); or computed tomography colonography every 5 years.\n\n【20】Screening for Colorectal Cancer: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.\n\n【21】These CRC screening options vary in terms of effectiveness, safety, and cost, supporting the rationale for endorsing multiple strategies, rather than a single, one-size-fits-all approach. Patients may be more likely to complete screening and adhere to recommended screening schedules depending upon the fit between the patient’s needs and preferences and available screening options.\n\n【22】Older adults' preferences for colorectal cancer-screening test attributes and test choice.\n\n【23】Preferences for colorectal cancer screening tests and screening test use in a large multispecialty primary care practice.\n\n【24】Research has shown that provider recommendation strongly influences CRC screening completion and CRC screening recommendations that are aligned with patient preferences may improve CRC screening acceptance and adherence.\n\n【25】The impact of a novel computer-based decision aid on shared decision making for colorectal cancer screening: a randomized trial.\n\n【26】Adherence to colorectal cancer screening: a randomized clinical trial of competing strategies.\n\n【27】Although the USPSTF endorses CRC screening strategies with evidence of a high certainty of net benefit, the effectiveness of each of the screening strategies is undermined by population underuse and suboptimal adherence to screening recommendations.\n\n【28】Effect of colonoscopy outreach vs fecal immunochemical test outreach on colorectal cancer screening completion: a randomized clinical trial.\n\n【29】Consequently, an additional consideration in weighing the pros and cons of various screening options is patient adherence. The most consistent factor associated with completion of CRC screening is clinician recommendation.\n\n【30】As new CRC screening strategies emerge, it is critical to evaluate clinician knowledge of the screening tests and to assess relevant attitudes and behaviors that may influence their recommendations to patients.\n\n【31】To further explore health care provider (HCP) preferences for endorsed CRC screening options, we developed and implemented a national survey of relevant knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among practicing primary care clinicians (PCCs) and gastroenterologists (GIs). The primary aims of the study were to delineate and compare factors associated with CRC screening knowledge, attitudes, and behavior by screening option among PCCs and GIs and to identify factors associated with greater knowledge and use of novel CRC screening technologies. In our analysis, we characterized provider, clinical practice, and patient characteristics associated with CRC screening preferences and practices among PCCs and GIs.\n\n【32】Participants and Methods\n------------------------\n\n【33】### Survey Development\n\n【34】Following the Theoretical Domains Framework, we developed a survey to assess factors associated with implementation of novel practices or technologies into clinical practice including knowledge; skills; social/professional role and identity; beliefs about capabilities; optimism; beliefs about consequences; intentions; memory, attention, and decision processes; environmental context and resources; and social influences.\n\n【35】Additional survey items were adopted from the National Cancer Institute’s Physician Survey on Colorectal Cancer Screening.\n\n【36】Pretest interviews were conducted with 11 clinicians from the panel to validate the survey length, survey programming, and data collection methodology before administering the survey.\n\n【37】### Data Collection\n\n【38】Data were collected through a web survey between November 6, 2019, and December 6, 2019, by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.\n\n【39】National Opinion Research Center worked with a third-party vendor, Dynata, to collect these data. Dynata maintains a panel of physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, and other HCPs in the United States.\n\n【40】Panel respondents were recruited from lists of more than 200,000 HCPs identified and validated through sources including the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the National Provider Identifier databases. HCPs consent to participate in the panel, are asked to complete a profile, and their data is integrated with the American Medical Association and National Provider Identifier databases to inform matches between providers and survey invitations.\n\n【41】### Sample\n\n【42】Surveys were sent via email to 3299 PCCs and 538 GIs. Up to two reminders were sent to nonresponders within a 21-day period. Surveys were completed by 779 PCCs (internal medicine n=403; family medicine n=376) and 159 GIs. The survey completion rate for PCCs was 25.3% and for GIs was 29.6%. All participants received remuneration for completing the survey; per the standard remuneration practices of Dynata, based on fair market compensation rates, PCCs received $39, whereas GIs received $51.\n\n【43】### Analysis\n\n【44】All data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4. Respondents who indicated that they do not recommend CRC screening to their average-risk patients (n=5), and those who indicated no preference or a primary preference other than colonoscopy, mt-sDNA, FIT, or gFOBT, for average-risk patients (n=42), were excluded from further analyses because other screening options are rarely used in clinical practice and only a small percentage of all respondents selected each alternative modality (<1%).\n\n【45】Frequencies for provider and clinical practice characteristics were calculated and summarized separately for PCCs and GIs. Cross-tabulation with a χ <sup>2 </sup> test was used to assess differences in CRC screening test preferences between PCCs and GIs by provider and clinical practice characteristics ( _P_ <.05). Separately for PCCs and GIs, CRC screening preference by patient characteristics was summarized as direct visualization modalities (eg, colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy) or noninvasive modalities (eg, stool-based tests and computed tomography colonography). Among PCCs, we conducted a multinomial regression analysis to evaluate provider characteristics (eg, board certification, clinical degree, and years in practice) and practice characteristics (eg, patient volume, clinical practice size, and rural/urban status) associated with CRC screening preference among stool-based tests (eg, FIT, gFOBT, and mt-sDNA), controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. Results of the multinomial model, presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs, summarize the odds of preferring mt-sDNA over FIT and the odds of preferring mt-sDNA over gFOBT, separately.\n\n【46】Results\n-------\n\n【47】### Sociodemographic, Provider, and Practice Characteristics\n\n【48】As summarized in Table 1 , most PCCs were aged 50 years or older (56.0%; 436/777), male (72.5%; 563/779), White, non-Hispanic (66.2%; 516/779), and earned $200,000 or more annually (57.4%; 447/779). Only three of the PCCs were advanced practice providers (eg, nurse practitioners or physician assistants) whereas the remaining were physicians. The majority of PCCs reported practicing medicine at least 20 years postresidency (52.4%; 408/779), working in clinics with fewer than 16 clinicians (73.4%; 572/779), and characterized their clinical practice as being in a suburban (54.6%; 425/779) or urban (32.0%; 249/779) location. The majority of PCCs reported seeing, on average, 20 or fewer patients per day (56.0%; 436/779).\n\n【49】Table 1 Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Survey Participants by Clinical Specialty\n\n【50】Values are n (%).\n\n|  | Primary carebIncludes Internal Medicine and Family Medicine.(n=779) | Gastroenterology (n=159) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Age, years |  |  |\n| 27-39 | 103 (13.2) | 41 (25.8) |\n| 40-49 | 240 (30.8) | 42 (26.4) |\n| 50-60 | 254 (32.6) | 45 (28.3) |\n| 60+ | 182 (23.4) | 31 (19.5) |\n| SexcNumbers do not always add to total due to missing responses. |  |  |\n| Male | 563 (72.5) | 131 (82.9) |\n| Female | 214 (27.5) | 27 (17.1) |\n| Race/ethnicity |  |  |\n| White, non-Hispanic | 516 (66.2) | 88 (55.4) |\n| Black, non-Hispanic | 16 (2.1) | 4 (2.5) |\n| Hispanic | 25 (3.2) | 10 (6.3) |\n| Asian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic | 185 (23.8) | 42 (26.4) |\n| Other/Multiple Race, non-Hispanic | 37 (4.8) | 15 (9.4) |\n| Annual household income |  |  |\n| Less than $74,999 | 41 (5.3) | 4 (2.5) |\n| $75,000 to $124,999 | 95 (12.2) | 9 (5.7) |\n| $125,000 to $174,999 | 113 (14.5) | 12 (7.6) |\n| $175,000 to $199,999 | 83 (10.7) | 16 (10.1) |\n| $200,000 or more | 447 (57.4) | 118 (74.2) |\n| Board certification |  |  |\n| Internal medicine | 403 (51.7) | — |\n| Family medicine | 376 (48.3) | — |\n| Gastroenterology | 0 | 159 (100) |\n| Clinical degree |  |  |\n| Physician (MD, DO, MMS) | 776 (99.6) | 159 (100) |\n| Advanced practice provider (PA/NP) | 3 (0.4) | — |\n| Number of years practicing medicine post-residency |  |  |\n| 0-9 | 112 (14.4) | 42 (26.4) |\n| 10-19 | 259 (33.3) | 53 (33.3) |\n| 20-29 | 264 (33.9) | 45 (28.3) |\n| 30+ | 144 (18.5) | 19 (12.0) |\n| Average number of patients seen on typical day |  |  |\n| 0-15 | 156 (20.0) | 41 (25.8) |\n| 16-20 | 280 (35.9) | 49 (30.8) |\n| 21-25 | 181 (23.2) | 30 (18.9) |\n| 26+ | 162 (20.8) | 39 (24.5) |\n| Number of clinicians in practice |  |  |\n| 0-15 | 572 (73.4) | 103 (64.8) |\n| 16+ | 207 (26.6) | 56 (35.2) |\n| Characterization of clinical practice location |  |  |\n| Urban | 249 (32.0) | 81 (50.9) |\n| Suburban | 425 (54.6) | 69 (43.4) |\n| Rural | 105 (13.5) | 9 (5.7) | a Values are n (%).\n\n【52】b Includes Internal Medicine and Family Medicine.\n\n【53】c Numbers do not always add to total due to missing responses.\n\n【54】Most GIs were younger than 50 years of age (52.2%; 83/159), male (82.9%; 131/158), White, non-Hispanic (55.4%; 88/159), and earned $200,000 or more annually (74.2%; 118/159). The majority of GIs reported practicing medicine fewer than 20 years postresidency (59.7%; 95/159), working in clinics with fewer than 16 clinicians (64.8%; 103/159), and characterized their clinical practice as being in an urban (50.9%; 81/159) or suburban (43.4%; 69/159) location. The majority of GIs reported seeing, on average, 20 or fewer patients per day (56.6%; 90/159).\n\n【55】### CRC Screening Test Preference\n\n【56】Colonoscopy was selected as the preferred screening method for average-risk patients by both groups, with a significantly higher percentage of GIs (96.9%; 154/159) compared with PCCs (75.7%; 590/779) preferring colonoscopy . Among PCCs, 12.2% (95/779) selected mt-sDNA as their second most preferred CRC screening test, followed by FIT (7.3%; 57/779) and gFOBT (4.8%; 37/779). Only 3.2% (5/159) of GIs selected a stool-based test as their preferred modality for their average-risk patients. Although PCCs overwhelmingly preferred colonoscopy over stool-based tests, no significant differences in preference for colonoscopy compared with stool-based tests were observed sociodemographic and clinical characteristics among PCCs .\n\n【57】Table 2 Preference for Colorectal Cancer Screening Test by Health Care Provider Board Certification\n\n【58】CRC, colorectal cancer; FIT, fecal immunochemical test; gFOBT, guaiac-based fecal occult blood test; mt-sDNA, multitarget stool DNA.\n\n| Preferred CRC screening method for average-risk patients | Clinical specialty/board certification, n (%) | _P_ |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Primary carebIncludes Internal Medicine and Family Medicine.(n=779) | Gastroenterology (n=159) |\n| --- | --- |\n| gFOBT | 37 (4.8) | 0 |  |\n| FIT | 57 (7.3) | 3 (1.9) |  |\n| mt-sDNA | 95 (12.2) | 2 (1.3) |  |\n| Colonoscopy | 590 (75.7) | 154 (96.9) |  | a CRC, colorectal cancer; FIT, fecal immunochemical test; gFOBT, guaiac-based fecal occult blood test; mt-sDNA, multitarget stool DNA.\n\n【60】b Includes Internal Medicine and Family Medicine.\n\n【61】Table 3 Primary Care Clinician Preference for Colonoscopy Over Stool-Based Tests for Average-Risk Patients by Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics\n\n|  | Primary care clinicians,aIncludes Internal Medicine and Family Medicine.n (%) | _P_ |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Prefer Stool-Based (N=189) | Prefer Colonoscopy (N=590) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age in years |  |  | .6748 |\n| 27-39 | 24 (12.7) | 79 (13.4) |  |\n| 40-49 | 58 (30.7) | 182 (30.9) |  |\n| 50-60 | 57 (30.2) | 197 (33.4) |  |\n| \\>60 | 50 (26.5) | 132 (22.4) |  |\n| Sex |  |  | .094 |\n| Male | 128 (67.7) | 435 (74.0) |  |\n| Female | 61 (32.3) | 153 (26.0) |  |\n| Race/ethnicity |  |  | .6466 |\n| White, non-Hispanic | 123 (65.1) | 393 (66.6) |  |\n| Black, non-Hispanic | 4 (2.1) | 12 (2.0) |  |\n| Hispanic | 7 (3.7) | 18 (3.05) |  |\n| Asian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic | 50 (26.5) | 135 (22.9) |  |\n| Other/Multiple Race, non-Hispanic | 5 (2.7) | 32 (5.4) |  |\n| Annual household income |  |  | .2227 |\n| Less than $74,999 | 11 (5.8) | 30 (5.1) |  |\n| $75,000 to $124,999 | 27 (14.3) | 68 (11.5) |  |\n| $125,000 to $174,999 | 35 (18.5) | 78 (13.2) |  |\n| $175,000 to $199,999 | 20 (10.6) | 63 (10.7) |  |\n| $200,000 or more | 96 (50.8) | 351 (59.5) |  |\n| Board certification |  |  | .4244 |\n| Internal medicine | 93 (49.2) | 310 (52.5) |  |\n| Family medicine | 96 (50.8) | 280 (47.5) |  |\n| Gastroenterology |  |  |  |\n| Number of years practicing medicine post-residency |  |  | .6252 |\n| 0-9 | 22 (11.6) | 90 (15.3) |  |\n| 10-19 | 65 (34.4) | 194 (32.9) |  |\n| 20-29 | 64 (33.9) | 200 (33.9) |  |\n| 30+ | 38 (20.1) | 106 (18.0) |  |\n| Average number of patients seen on typical day |  |  | .4753 |\n| 0-15 | 31 (16.4) | 125 (21.2) |  |\n| 16-20 | 70 (37.0) | 210 (35.6) |  |\n| 21-25 | 49 (25.9) | 132 (22.4) |  |\n| \\>25 | 39 (20.6) | 123 (20.9) |  |\n| Number of clinicians in practice |  |  | .8830 |\n| 0-15 | 138 (73.0) | 434 (73.6) |  |\n| 16+ | 51 (27.0) | 156 (26.4) |  |\n| Characterization of clinical practice location |  |  | .6353 |\n| Urban | 64 (33.9) | 185 (31.4) |  |\n| Suburban | 103 (54.5) | 322 (54.6) |  |\n| Rural | 22 (11.6) | 83 (14.1) |  | a Includes Internal Medicine and Family Medicine.\n\n【63】In general, CRC screening modality preference by patient characteristics mirrored their overall preference for average-risk patients among both PCCs and GIs .

A similar pattern was observed in the likelihood of preferring mt-sDNA over FIT (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.36).

Whereas nearly all GIs preferred colonoscopy, approximately one in four PCCs selected stool-based CRC screening tests as the preferred option for their average-risk patients, with mt-sDNA selected more than FIT and gFOBT combined. Furthermore, preference for colonoscopy versus stool-based tests did not differ significantly by clinician experience and clinical practice characteristics. These results reveal considerable homogeneity in CRC screening preferences among the HCP respondents, particularly GIs. Previous research has suggested that the common practice of recommending colonoscopy may actually reduce adherence to CRC screening, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities, and that offering stool-based screening or a choice of either stool-based screening or colonoscopy is associated with greater adherence.\n\n【78】Adherence to colorectal cancer screening: a randomized clinical trial of competing strategies.\n\n【79】Adherence to competing strategies for colorectal cancer screening over 3 years.\n\n【80】Although preference for CRC screening options by various patient characteristics largely mirrored the overall preference for colonoscopy among PCCs and GIs, preference shifted to stool-based tests for patients facing barriers to screening, including inability to undergo an invasive procedure, concerns about taking time away from work, uncertainty about the need to get screened, and refusal of other screening recommendations. The availability and recommendation of multiple CRC screening modalities with differences in effectiveness, cost, risk, and patient acceptability highlights the critical need for HCPs to provide patients with accurate information about all available options to support informed choice and shared decision-making. Prior research has consistently shown that clinician recommendation is a key determinant of CRC screening.\n\n【81】Our findings suggest that, to some extent, clinicians are attentive to the CRC screening needs and preferences of their patients.\n\n【82】Interestingly, approximately one-quarter of PCCs in our study selected a stool-based test as their preferred CRC screening option, with mt-sDNA selected more frequently than either FIT or gFOBT. Although these data support PCC interest in a noninvasive screening strategy for many average-risk patients, screening colonoscopy remains the most frequently used colon cancer screening test and is considered the gold standard.\n\n【83】However, particularly as new CRC screening tests become available, further investigation is needed to clarify the practice, provider, and patient characteristics that influence overall and test-specific preferences and practices for CRC screening.\n\n【84】### Study Limitations\n\n【85】Our cross-sectional survey design precludes the evaluation of causal associations. The survey relies upon self-report rather than observed or documented information (eg, medical records data). Finally, although consistent with declining and generally lower response rates of clinician surveys, our completion rate was limited for both PCCs and GIs, which may introduce selection bias.\n\n【86】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【87】In our national survey of PCCs and GIs, colonoscopy was identified as the preferred CRC screening option for average-risk patients. However, approximately one-quarter of PCCs preferred stool-based tests, particularly mt-sDNA. Although few differences in preference by clinician experience and practice characteristics were observed, certain patient characteristics were associated with provider test preference (albeit without broad, discernible patterns). With the availability of multiple CRC screening options with distinct benefits and drawbacks related to effectiveness, cost, risk, and patient acceptability, it is critical to support informed choice and shared decision-making between patients and their providers.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The second objective focused on reevaluation and modification of previous recommendations for evaluation of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity in men with known CVD. The Panel's recommendations build on those developed during the first and second Princeton Consensus Conferences, first emphasizing the use of exercise ability and stress testing to ensure that each man's cardiovascular health is consistent with the physical demands of sexual activity before prescribing treatment for ED, and second highlighting the link between ED and CVD, which may be asymptomatic and may benefit from cardiovascular risk reduction.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ABI ( ankle-brachial index ), ACCF ( American College of Cardiology Foundation ), AHA ( American Heart Association ), BMI ( body mass index ), BP ( blood pressure ), CACS ( coronary artery calcium scoring ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), CCTA ( coronary computed tomographic angiography ), CIMT ( carotid intima-media thickness ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), ED ( erectile dysfunction ), EST ( exercise stress testing ), FRS ( Framingham Risk Score ), HDL ( high-density lipoprotein ), hsCRP ( high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ), LOE ( level of evidence ), Mets ( metabolic equivalents of the task ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), NYHA ( New York Heart Association ), PAD ( peripheral artery disease ), PDE5 ( phosphodiesterase type 5 ), PWV ( pulse wave velocity ), TRT ( testosterone replacement therapy ), TT ( total testosterone ), WC ( waist circumference )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Fortunately, we had some success in 2005 in getting more of these types of manuscripts submitted. Critical to this process was the introduction of an electronic manuscript submission system, an action that resulted in 41% more total submissions to the journal in 2005 than in 2004. As we transition into 2006, it appears that manuscript submissions will remain strong and provide increasingly high-quality material from which the reviewers and editorial board can select.\n\n【2】Given increasing competition for physicians' time, we will keep the size of the monthly journal relatively constant and be more selective in the materials we publish. Consistent with this view, in 2005, the overall acceptance rate of manuscripts submitted to the _Proceedings_ decreased to one half of the 2004 value. Reviewing a manuscript begins with an assessment of its relevance to the interests of our readership and the importance of the message. Manuscripts undergo further review only if they pass these 2 standards.\n\n【3】Our research has repeatedly asked readers which elements of the journal they value most and least. Consistently, case reports have been placed at the “least interesting” end of the scale. The editorial board believes that case reports can be valuable, but important case reports are rare. To better select the highest quality reports, the editorial board has revised and codified our policies for case report review and the standards for acceptance. Manuscripts of the “case report and review of the literature” genre will no longer be accepted. Publication priority will be given to case reports that identify (1) a first-of-its-kind, unexpected, or unusual observation of a disease process of relevance to a meaningful number of patients (eg, a new disease or syndrome, a previously unknown or important manifestation of a common disease, or a new understanding of the pathophysiology of a common disease); (2) a new or first observation of an important adverse effect of a commonly used drug; or (3) new therapeutic activity of a new treatment, including drug and nondrug therapies. Hence, the acceptance rate for case reports in 2006 and beyond will be extremely small compared to that in the past.\n\n【4】An additional small fraction of manuscripts rejected for publication as case reports, but offering some incremental advances in knowledge, may, if appropriately novel, be given priority for conversion to a letter to the editor.\n\n【5】These new standards for reviewing case reports will be added to our Web site . Clearly, it will require some time to publish case reports already accepted by the earlier journal standards. Hence, readers should not expect to see published case reports conform entirely to the new standards for some months.\n\n【6】In mid-2006, we will complete publication of the “Symposium on Oncology Practice: Hematological Malignancies” and will begin a new “Symposium on Oncology Practice: Solid Tumor Malignancies.” The former collection of articles will be collated into a book that will be available for purchase from our Web site. Shortly before the book is published, the editorial board will determine whether incremental advances in hematologic malignancy research warrant annotation or updating of the articles published earlier in the series. Our final decision will be dictated by a desire to provide readers with the most up-to-date available information on hematologic malignancies.\n\n【7】The editorial board has also approved publishing 1 or more theme-based supplemental issues per year, provided these address topics of interest to our readers and we are able to identify appropriate sponsors. Consistent with these values, in 2006, we will publish supplements on severe obesity and diabetes-associated peripheral neuropathic pain. We will explore other supplement topics, but only if the supplement proposals meet the journal's high standards for content relevance and quality.\n\n【8】We are well aware that physicians' reading patterns and preferences for content access vary considerably and are based on a host of factors, including the reader's age, practice and research interests, use of technology in daily practice, and sense of aesthetics. Nevertheless, readers of all types appear to be migrating from print publication toward electronic publication. Thus, the _Proceedings_ plans to enhance the readability of both the print and the electronic forms of the journal, introducing redundancies between the two, if needed, to meet the needs of access-entrenched readers and those in transition.\n\n【9】Readers have also informed us that they prefer some mechanism of obtaining category 1 CME credit for reading the journal. We will begin an experimental program of providing CME credit for supplement articles in early 2006. We will monitor the success of this program and likely expand CME credit to other portions of the journal in the near future.\n\n【10】These are dynamic times at the _Proceedings_ , and our busy readers may wonder how they can keep up with all the new initiatives. To assist in this matter, we will introduce to our Web site an option by which readers can electively obtain e-mail alerts of new journal content and services. Alerts will be sent on the first day of the month, coincident with release of both the print and the electronic versions of the journal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

As part of the Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study, with a catchment population of 1 million, patients with SCA were compared with control subjects from the same geographic region with a diagnosis of coronary artery disease to match that among cases. All patients included had available serum electrolyte levels and creatinine clearance values within 90 days of the sudden cardiac death event. In this cohort, SCA was more prevalent in black patients, those with diabetes mellitus, and those with chronic kidney disease. In their multivariate analysis, serum calcium levels lower than 8.95 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.25) were associated with a 2.3-fold increase in SCA compared with levels higher than 9.55 mg/dL. Each unit reduction in serum calcium was associated with a 1.6-fold increase in risk of SCA. This is the first report to show that low serum calcium levels measured close in time to the index event are independently associated with an increased risk of SCA in the general population.\n\n【3】Derangements in serum electrolytes are associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.\n\n【4】Interestingly, both high and low electrolyte levels are associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, suggesting that a fine balance of electrolytes critical in regulating cardiovascular excitability is required, without which arrhythmias and sudden death may occur. For example, both hyperkalemia and hypokalemia are associated with cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Infusion of potassium chloride is part of the lethal injection protocol in capital punishment. Moreover, hypokalemia as well as other electrolyte disturbances account for most sudden deaths in patients with eating disorders. Both high\n\n【5】Association of serum magnesium on mortality in patients admitted to the intensive cardiac care unit.\n\n【6】and low\n\n【7】Serum magnesium and the risk of death from coronary heart disease and sudden cardiac death.\n\n【8】serum magnesium levels are also associated with increased mortality and sudden death. In contrast, hypernatremia and hyponatremia are not associated with arrhythmogenesis or sudden death.\n\n【9】The effects of serum calcium on the development of cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death are less clear despite the critical role of intracellular calcium in the regulation of cardiovascular physiology. Calcium ions are one of the most ubiquitous signal transduction molecules in almost all cells and are particularly important in regulating cardiac physiology and electrophysiology. There is a 10,000-fold calcium ion gradient across the sarcolemma of a healthy cardiomyocyte, with an intracellular calcium concentration of approximately 100 nmol and an extracellular calcium concentration of approximately 2 mmol. Intracellular calcium concentrations are tightly regulated in cardiomyocytes and are key determinants in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling.\n\n【10】Inability to maintain a low intracellular calcium environment is usually associated with cardiac pathology, and intracellular calcium overload is known to be a cause of arrhythmogenesis, mediating sudden cardiac death.\n\n【11】Well-known examples include acute myocardial ischemia, most forms of cardiomyopathies and congestive heart failure, digitalis toxicity, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardias, and ischemia/reperfusion.\n\n【12】Extracellular calcium homeostasis is similarly tightly controlled and is dependent on the balance between dietary intake, intestinal absorption, renal excretion, and bone remodeling. It is under the regulation of parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and ionized calcium, as well as their respective receptors.\n\n【13】The reference range of serum calcium is 8.9 to 10.1 mg/dL. Approximately half of the serum calcium is present as free ions, 40% is bound to albumin and globulins, and approximately 10% is complexed with phosphate, carbonate, and oxalate. Hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia represent conditions of disordered calcium homeostasis and are associated with profound cardiovascular abnormalities. Hypercalcemia is associated with hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, vascular calcification, shortened QT interval, and arrhythmias. Hypocalcemia is associated with heart failure, prolonged QT intervals, and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias.\n\n【14】Both high and low serum calcium levels are associated with increased mortality. Several studies that followed patients long-term concluded that high calcium levels observed at baseline were associated with a significant increase in all-cause mortality, especially cardiovascular mortality, but the risk of SCA was not determined.\n\n【15】Calcium, phosphate and the risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in a population with stable coronary heart disease.\n\n【16】The results of these studies were not supported by other reports and seem to be different from the results of the present study. A major issue is that serum calcium homeostasis may change with age because renal function deteriorates after 40 years of age, with accelerated functional reduction at advanced age. In addition, parathyroid hormone levels tend to increase whereas intestinal absorption of calcium is reduced with age. Hence, a baseline calcium determination years or decades earlier may not reflect the calcium level at the time of the event. The study by Yarmohammadi et al\n\n【17】Serum calcium and risk of sudden cardiac arrest in the general population.\n\n【18】required a serum calcium determination within 90 days of SCA, which provides a more accurate assessment of serum calcium in relationship to the event.\n\n【19】The mechanism through which low serum calcium levels may lead to sudden cardiac death is unclear. Patients with SCA had a more prolonged QT interval, pointing toward an arrhythmic event as a potential cause. Indeed, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia are all known to be associated with prolonged QT intervals, which have been shown to be an independent risk of sudden cardiac death in the general population.\n\n【20】Prolonged QTc interval and risk of sudden cardiac death in a population of older adults.\n\n【21】The effects of lower serum calcium levels on cardiac electrophysiology are multiple. For example, with a lower serum calcium concentration, calcium influx through the L-type calcium channel may be reduced, leading to reduced plateau depolarization and a shortened cardiac action potential. However, a reduced calcium level may lead to slower L-type calcium channel inactivation, which may prolong the opening of calcium channels, sustaining the plateau of the cardiac action potential and leading to QT prolongation. QT prolongation may also arise because a low serum calcium level may result in a weaker outward current carried by the electrogenic sodium-calcium exchange in reverse mode during the plateau. In addition to its effects on cardiac electrophysiology, hypocalcemia may facilitate the development of cardiomyopathy and heart failure, which are related to increased mortality and cardiovascular events.\n\n【22】Low serum calcium is associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction in a Chinese population with coronary artery disease.\n\n【23】These cellular and molecular effects of low serum calcium levels may contribute to the development of arrhythmia and SCA.\n\n【24】Some caution must be applied in interpreting the results of the study by Yarmohammadi et al.\n\n【25】Serum calcium and risk of sudden cardiac arrest in the general population.\n\n【26】First, it is not clear that cases with laboratory values available within 90 days of the index event were representative of all patients with SCA. Cases with laboratory values available likely had a heavier burden of comorbidities, necessitating frequent blood draws, and the authors acknowledge the disparities in these 2 populations of patients with SCA in their Methods section, including differences in the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. Although it was important for this study to have a recent serum calcium level in the cases included, this potentially introduced selection bias. Second, this is an observational study, and the cause of the low calcium level is unknown. Important information on the levels of parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and serum magnesium are not available. Third, the cause of SCA is unknown. If prolonged QT interval is a contributing factor, information on the co-administration of QT-prolonging drugs would be helpful. Finally, it would be valuable to know whether the patients and control subjects were taking calcium and vitamin D supplements to ascertain their effects on serum calcium levels and outcomes.\n\n【27】In the study by Yarmohammadi et al,\n\n【28】Serum calcium and risk of sudden cardiac arrest in the general population.\n\n【29】SCA occurred more frequently in black patients and in those with more comorbidities, higher use of diuretics, lower left ventricular ejection fractions, lower creatinine clearance, and lower serum calcium levels. In a multivariate analysis, the lowest serum calcium quartile (<8.95 mg/dL) carried a 2.3-fold increase in risk of SCA compared with the highest quartile (>9.55 mg/dL). This finding was unchanged when patients who were undergoing hemodialysis were excluded from the analysis. These findings provide support for the conclusion that lower serum calcium levels are independently associated with increased risk of SCA in the community.\n\n【30】What are the implications of these findings? First, serum calcium levels should be examined and followed longitudinally more carefully. Determinants of extracellular calcium should be evaluated with the same vigor given to intracellular calcium regulation. Second, low serum calcium levels may be considered a potential risk factor for SCA in the community. In the presence of other risk factors, such as coronary heart disease, cardiomyopathies and heart failure, QT-prolonging drugs or conditions, serum electrolyte disturbances, diabetes, and renal failure, a heightened awareness of a low serum calcium level may help identify vulnerable patients at risk for SCA. Third, more research is necessary to determine whether patients in the lowest quartile of serum calcium would benefit from higher dietary calcium intake or calcium supplementation. Currently, increased oral intake of calcium is not recommended as current evidence regarding oral calcium intake and cardiovascular risk is unsettled. In the Iowa Women's Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 34,486 postmenopausal Iowa women without a history of ischemic heart disease, higher oral calcium intake was associated with reduced ischemic heart disease mortality after 8 years of follow-up.\n\n【31】In contrast, in a randomized placebo-controlled trial in New Zealand involving 1471 postmenopausal women, myocardial infarction was more common in the calcium group, and the composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, or sudden death was also more common in the calcium group over 5 years.\n\n【32】Vascular events in healthy older women receiving calcium supplementation: randomized controlled trial.\n\n【33】Other studies did not show any significant association between calcium intake and cardiovascular events and mortality.

Verner-Morrison syndrome has not been described as a paraneoplastic syndrome in non–small cell lung cancer. We describe a 38-year-old man with metastatic non–small cell lung cancer of large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation who presented with bone metastasis and intractable secretory diarrhea that was unresponsive to pharmacological treatment, including octreotide. Laboratory evaluation indicated elevated serum calcitonin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide levels. Chemotherapy resulted in a transient response in the patient's diarrhea and neuroendocrine markers. The patient did not respond to further therapy and died 5 months after onset of back pain. To our knowledge, this is the first published case of large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation associated with treatmentresponsive paraneoplastic Verner-Morrison syndrome.\n\n【1】cAMP ( cyclic adenosine monophosphate ), CEA ( carcinoembryonic antigen ), CT ( computed tomography ), IV ( intravenous ), LCCND ( large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation )\n\n【2】Secretory diarrhea is caused most commonly by infection.\n\n【3】Secretory diarrhea is defined by a stool osmotic gap less than 50 mOsm/kg. Typically, it is mediated by a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway best described in _Vibrio cholerae_ enterotoxin. This leads to increased secretion of intracellular chloride and bicarbonate and decreased absorption of intraluminal sodium. Patients with enterotoxin-mediated diarrhea present with severe hypokalemia secondary to potassium loss in the stool and dehydration due to concomitant free water loss.\n\n【4】Evaluating a patient who presents with chronic secretory diarrhea can be complicated. Patients may present with large volumes of watery diarrhea refractory to traditional antidiarrheals such as atropine or loperamide. Patients often undergo a gastrointestinal evaluation, including multiple stool studies for infection, laxative abuse, protein-losing enteropathy, and inflammatory bowel disease. Also, patients often undergo upper and lower endoscopies to exclude underlying colitis, celiac sprue, vasculitis, intestinal lymphangiectasia, and lymphoma. In most cases, these investigations are sufficient for finding the etiology of the diarrhea. However, if no source is found, an endocrine cause must be considered for this extremely debilitating problem.\n\n【5】In secretory diarrhea induced by paracrine hormones such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), calcitonin, and gastrin, the stimulus for chloride secretion is via the same cAMP mechanism as _Vibrio_ toxin. A VIPoma syndrome, originally described in the Verner-Morrison syndrome, has been referred to as pancreatic cholera or endocrine cholera because the stool resembles that of patients with cholera. This syndrome has been associated with islet tumors of the pancreas, neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and ganglioneuromas. Patients with VIPomas often have profound hypercalcemia and non–anion gap metabolic acidosis. Another effect specific to the hormone is hypokalemia from VIP-induced hyperaldosteronism.\n\n【6】Such patients require aggressive hydration and supplementation of potassium to correct ongoing loss. The current suggested management for VIP-induced diarrhea is with somatostatin analogues such as octreotide.\n\n【7】The response rate (improvement of diarrhea) varies but has been reported to range from 90% to 95%, with complete response between 10% and 65%.\n\n【8】Somatostatin and gastroenteropancreatic tumors—therapeutic characteristics.\n\n【9】Less is known about calcitoninsecreting tumors associated with diarrhea. Like VIP, calcitonin can cause profuse secretory diarrhea, hypokalemia, and dehydration.\n\n【10】Calcitonin-secreting tumors of the pancreas: about six cases.\n\n【11】Most cases are associated with pancreatic islet cell tumors\n\n【12】Calcitonin-secreting tumors of the pancreas: about six cases.\n\n【13】or medullary thyroid carcinoma, with scattered case reports of pulmonary carcinoid tumors secreting calcitonin.\n\n【14】In addition, calcitonin has been documented by radio-labeled immunoassay to be ectopically produced by small cell lung cancer.\n\n【15】Calcitonin elevation in small cell lung cancer without ectopic production.\n\n【16】Infusions of synthetic salmon calcitonin have been shown to increase jejunal secretion in 8 of 10 healthy volunteers, suggesting a possible etiology of diarrhea associated with medullary thyroid carcinoma. Unlike for VIPomas, published reports do not support the use of somatostatin-related compounds in the treatment of calcitonin-induced diarrhea associated with malignant medullary thyroid carcinoma.\n\n【17】The therapy is focused on resection of the primary lesion.\n\n【18】We describe a patient who was found to have non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), classified as large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation (LCCND), with elevated levels of serum calcitonin and VIP. Our treatment with somatostatin analogues, antidiarrheals, and chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin did not halt progression of disease but temporarily improved diarrheal symptoms and ectopic hormone levels.\n\n【19】REPORT OF A CASE\n----------------\n\n【20】A 38-year-old man presented to the medical oncology department at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, after 2 months of progressive mid-thoracic back pain. Subsequently, the patient required narcotic analgesics for relief of pain and developed a right foot drop. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine revealed a compression fracture of the T7 vertebra with impingement on the adjacent spinal cord. The patient was given intravenous (IV) corticosteroids for spinal cord compression and underwent vertebrectomy of the T7 vertebra 2 days later. The pathology of the vertebral specimen was reported as a malignant neoplasm not further classifiable due to widespread necrosis, and ancillary studies with an extensive panel of immunohistochemical stains were noncontributory. The patient was noted to have a normal complete blood cell count and electrolyte panel; also, computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were normal. Subsequent laboratory test results included normal serum protein electrophoresis, an elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of 39.5 ng/mL (upper limit of normal \\[ULN\\], 3.0 ng/mL), and normal levels of alpha fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic and was observed for 2 weeks.\n\n【21】Five weeks after surgery, the patient developed profuse watery diarrhea, initially believed to be related to postoperative antibiotics. However, no stool analyses were performed at that time. Approximately 6 to 7 weeks after the patient's spinal surgery, he presented to the Mayo Clinic for evaluation of malignancy of unknown origin, persistent back pain, and uncontrollable diarrhea. Initial blood test results revealed the following (reference ranges shown parenthetically): sodium, 137 mEq/L (135-145 mEq/L); potassium, 2.8 mEq/L (3.6-4.8 mEq/L); calcium, 14.4 mg/ dL (8.9-10.1 mg/dL); CEA, 161.0 ng/mL (≤3.0 ng/mL); alkaline phosphatase, 440 U/L (98-251 U/L); prostate-specific antigen, 5.0 ng/mL (<2.0 ng/mL); lactate dehydrogenase, 304 U/L (91-198 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 57 U/L (12-31 U/L); and bicarbonate, 20 mEq/L (22-29 mEq/L). Test results for magnesium, glucose, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, creatinine, and serum urea nitrogen were normal.\n\n【22】The patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment of hypercalcemia and dehydration. On admission, the patient's physical examination revealed a moderately wasted man. No skin changes were noted. Examination of his chest, heart, and extremities revealed only tachycardia. The patient had no palpable lymph nodes or thyroid nodules. Abdominal examination was notable for hyperactive bowel sounds, mild distention, no organomegaly, and mild tenderness of the left lower quadrant. Chest radiographic findings were normal except for postoperative changes of the vertebrectomy . The patient was treated with fluid hydration and 4 mg of IV zoledronic acid for hypercalcemia of malignancy. The hypercalcemia improved within 3 days of treatment. With hydration, the patient's potassium level decreased to 2.1 mEq/L on day 5 of hospitalization. Continuous IV infusion of potassium chloride at 10 mEq/h and oral potassium chloride at 40 mEq every 8 hours did not improve his hypokalemia. His diarrhea worsened to approximately 5 L of stool per day. The patient's stool osmolality was 299 mOsm/kg (220-280 mOsm/kg). Stool electrolytes were as follows: sodium, 7 mEq/kg (ULN, 160 mEq/kg); potassium, 157 mEq/kg (ULN, 200 mEq/kg); chloride, 42 mEq/kg (ULN, 40 mEq/kg); magnesium, 2 mEq/kg (ULN, 200 mEq/kg). The patient's stool osmotic gap was calculated at –38 mOsm/kg, consistent with a secretory diarrhea. Bacterial cultures (number of cultures in brackets) were negative (including _Aeromonas_ \\[2\\], _Clostridium difficile_ toxin screens \\[6\\], ova and parasite screens \\[2\\], _Giardia_ antigen \\[2\\], and _Cryptosporidia, Isospora,_ and _Microsporidia_ \\[1 each\\]). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with small bowel biopsies revealed normal mucosa with no evidence of Whipple disease, celiac sprue, or _Giardia_ . Colonoscopy showed normal colonic mucosa with no evidence of microscopic colitis or inflammatory bowel disease. The patient was given a maximal dose of loperamide and atropine/diphenoxylate without improvement in symptoms. Subcutaneous octreotide, up to 300 µg 4 times a day, was added with no quantitative or symptomatic relief in high-volume diarrhea. Also, tincture of opium was added without success.\n\n【23】Figure 1 Chest x-ray film on admission shows normal findings except for postoperative changes of the vertebrectomy.\n\n【24】On hospital day 2, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was repeated to look for the primary source of malignancy. Computed tomography  revealed diffuse small lytic lesions throughout the visualized skeleton, the largest of which was 5 mm. Moderate lymphadenopathy was noted in the right paratracheal space with 2 noncalcified indeterminate nodules in the apex of the right lung, the largest being 1 cm. Multiple small metastatic lesions were present throughout the liver and kidneys, the largest being 6 mm. Mediastinoscopy with lymph node biopsy was performed. The histological features were those of a large cell carcinoma of lung origin, confirmed by positive immunoreactivity for keratin, CAM 5.2, and thyroid transcription factor 1 tumor markers . Neuroendocrine differentiation was confirmed at an immunohistochemical level with positive immunoreactivity for chromogranin ; however, the neoplastic cells were negative for calcitonin and VIP.\n\n【25】Figure 2 Chest computed tomogram shows nodules in 2 slices of the right upper lung.\n\n【26】Figure 3 Left, Intermediate-power photomicrograph of malignant neoplasm within paratracheal lymph node shows lack of glandular or squamous differentiation. The cells are large and pleomorphic with areas of necrosis (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×100). Right, Neoplastic cells, diffusely positive for chromogranin, show neuroendocrine differentiation by immunohistochemistry (chromogranin, original magnification ×100).\n\n【27】The patient's serum was screened for paraneoplastic causes of diarrhea. His VIP level was elevated at 2200 pg/mL (ULN, 75 pg/mL); calcitonin level was elevated at 9571 pg/mL (ULN, 15.9 pg/mL); corticotropin level was elevated slightly at 82 pg/mL (ULN, 60 pg/mL); and gastrin level was normal. The patient's thyrotropin level was depressed at 0.26 mIU/L (lower limit of normal, 0.30 mIU/L), but both total and free triiodothyronine levels were within normal limits. The parathyroid hormone (PTH)– related peptide level was normal, and the PTH level was elevated at 24 pmol/L (ULN, 5.2 pmol/L).\n\n【28】The patient was given etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy for NSCLC. The patient responded clinically within 2 days of treatment with substantial improvement in stool volume of less than 1 L per day. Next, parenteral potassium chloride was gradually decreased and discontinued. The patient's potassium level stabilized at 3.8 mEq/L. Serum markers for disease improved with treatment . Four days after treatment, the patient's calcitonin level decreased from 9571 to 3738 pg/mL, and his VIP level decreased from 2200 pg/mL to 428 pg/mL. However, his CEA level increased from 161 ng/mL to 299 ng/mL.\n\n【29】Figure 4 Endocrine tumor markers. Initiation of chemotherapy was on hospital day 11. We observed a substantial decline in tumor marker levels within 3 days. VIP = vasoactive intestinal polypeptide.\n\n【30】The patient's improvement was transient. He returned home, but within 2 weeks of treatment, his diarrhea and associated hypokalemia returned. A repeated calcitonin test revealed that the level had increased to 10,000 pg/mL or higher. The patient received a repeated course of etoposide and cisplatin, which improved both his diarrhea and potassium level for 1 week. Repeated CT of the abdomen showed enlarging liver metastases. Chemotherapy was changed to docetaxel and carboplatin without benefit. Shortly thereafter, the patient developed _Candida_ sepsis and died.\n\n【31】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【32】To our knowledge, this is the first published case of a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by secretory diarrhea due to the secretion of multiple active hormones, VIP and calcitonin, by metastatic pulmonary LCCND. Endocrine paraneoplastic syndromes occur in approximately 20% of patients with lung cancer but are associated much more commonly with small cell lung cancer and carcinoid tumors because of their neuroendocrine differentiation, which is characterized ultrastructurally by the presence of neuroendocrine granules and by immunoreactivity with different neuroendocrine markers, including chromogranin and synaptophysin. However, up to 20% of NSCLC, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, can display similar neuroendocrine differentiation and thus may explain the occurrence of endocrine syndromes with these subtypes, as seen in our patient.\n\n【33】A common neuroendocrine syndrome described with NSCLC is hypercalcemia of malignancy, secondary to osteolytic bone metastases and ectopic production of PTH or PTH-related peptide. Multiple other neuroendocrine syndromes have been described. Most are case reports, with large cell carcinoma described in association with ectopic secretion of chorionic gonadotropin, growth hormone, glucagon, and gastrin, but not with VIP. Although secretion of calcitonin has been described in NSCLC including large cell carcinoma, it usually has not been associated with any clinical manifestation.\n\n【34】Seven described neuroendocrine tumors can cause diarrhea: gastrinomas (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), VIPomas (Verner-Morrison syndrome), glucagonomas, somatostatinomas, pancreatic endocrine tumors secreting calcitonin, medullary thyroid cancer, and carcinoid syndrome.\n\n【35】These constitute a rare form of chronic diarrhea but should be considered when all other causes have been ruled out. Helpful features in identifying a paraneoplastic endocrine syndrome as the cause of chronic diarrhea include identification of a malignancy and the development of hypokalemia and hypercalcemia in association with fasting hyperglycemia. Verner-Morrison syndrome is most commonly caused by islet cell tumors of the pancreas secreting VIP, but calcitonin has been noted as a possible cause in some patients.\n\n【36】Interestingly, immunohistochemical studies of our patient's tumor revealed no calcitonin or VIP in the tumor. This suggests rapid release of synthesized hormone, reaching high levels in the blood and low to absent levels in tumor cells, similar to pancreatic epithelial VIPoma.\n\n【37】Alternatively, the tumor conceivably produced another as-yet unidentified substance that stimulated abnormal production of VIP and calcitonin by normal tissues. Elevation of calcitonin levels has been described in other forms of lung injury such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but not at levels causing paraneoplastic symptoms. Treatment resulted initially in a good biochemical response in VIP and calcitonin levels, but the CEA level increased soon after initiation of treatment. This response has been reported immediately after chemotherapy for colorectal cancer,\n\n【38】breast cancer,\n\n【39】Prospective evaluation of carcinoembryonic antigen levels and alternating chemotherapeutic regimens in metastatic breast cancer.\n\n【40】and non–seminoma germ cell tumor despite objective tumor response.\n\n【41】An LCCND is generally a high-grade tumor with a poor prognosis.\n\n【42】Large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation belongs to a group of poorly differentiated NSCLCs that can be divided into tumors that have neuroendocrine features on light microscopy and those that have only evidence of neuroendocrine differentiation detected on immunohistochemical staining (ie, synaptophysin, chromogranin, and neuron-specific enolase). The importance of neuroendocrine differentiation as a prognostic marker and as a marker of response to chemotherapy is controversial, with studies indicating better\n\n【43】The use of neuroendocrine immunoperoxidase markers to predict chemotherapy response in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.\n\n【44】Neuroendocrine differentiation is an independent prognostic factor in chemotherapy-treated nonsmall cell lung carcinoma.\n\n【45】or worse survival or response\n\n【46】Clinical characterization of non-small-cell lung cancer tumors showing neuroendocrine differentiation features.\n\n【47】or no difference\n\n【48】The prognostic significance of neuroendocrine markers and carcinoembryonic antigen in patients with resected stage I and II non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n【49】in survival or response to chemotherapy at all stages.\n\n【50】The aggressive nature of the tumor and the stress on the patient caused by Verner-Morrison syndrome presented a dilemma for the medical team. The use of chemotherapy when the primary source of the malignancy was unclear and the tumor type was poorly defined was complicated by the concern that many chemotherapies are associated with diarrhea as a common adverse effect. Nevertheless, when the paraneoplastic mechanism for the secretory diarrhea was determined, it required specific treatment of the tumor to control the symptoms because all other supportive measures had failed. Although the benefit of chemotherapy was shortlived, it allowed the patient to return home to spend valuable time with his family. This case illustrates an aggressive and debilitating malignancy associated with a paraneoplastic syndrome not previously reported with NSCLC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Chest radiographic findings were suggestive of miliary tuberculosis. Acid-fast bacilli were observed in a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen, and cultures were positive for _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ , which is susceptible to all drugs. Antituberculous treatment was initiated, with progressive improvement. The patient was readmitted to the hospital 5 weeks later because of progressive dizziness and headache. Remarkably, fundoscopic examination revealed presence of papilledema. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple small enhancing lesions (approximately 2 mm in diameter) in the brain with perifocal edema in both the supratentorial and the infratentorial compartments. Corticosteroid therapy was added to the medical regimen on the basis of intracranial edema and the presumed diagnosis of paradoxical reaction of brain tuberculomas. Corticosteroid therapy was given for 3 months, with tapering of the dose. After a 9-month course of antituberculous treatment, the patient recovered uneventfully.\n\n【1】Clinical deterioration during antituberculous therapy in patients whose symptoms have initially improved is known as a _paradoxical reaction_ . This condition could be caused by worsening of preexisting tuberculous lesions or development of new lesions not attributable to the normal disease course in a patient whose condition initially improved with antituberculous treatment and in whom paradoxical reaction occurred about 1 month after initiation of therapy. It has been proposed that paradoxical reaction is the result of an excessive inflammatory response in the context of immune reconstitution and increased antigen exposure after administration of antituberculous therapy. No changes in or discontinuation of antituberculous treatment is necessary when paradoxical reaction occurs. Some studies suggest that early recognition and treatment with systemic corticosteroid therapy might result in a more favorable outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

In their patient with HAE who developed laryngeal edema and several complications, they suspect that intubation per se might have induced laryngeal edema. We agree with this opinion because of our experience with 3 HAE patients who developed laryngeal edema while undergoing general anesthesia with intubation for surgery. Prior to intubation they had no laryngeal edema and had received no prophylactic treatment. Two of them had extubation difficulty because of massive laryngeal edema. Therefore, we now recommend a prophylactic treatment with C1 inhibitor concentrate for all our patients in need of intubation. They receive 500 U of Cl inhibitor concentrate (500 U corresponds to the amount of C1 inhibitor in 500 mL of human plasma) intravenously 30 minutes before intubation. None of the 7 patients treated in this manner has developed any complication during or after intubation.\n\n【1】In the HAE patients surveilled in our institution, more than 100 episodes of laryngeal edema were treated with 500 to 1000 U of C1 inhibitor concentrate. Relief and resolution of symptoms began 30 to 60 minutes after treatment, and intubation or tracheostomy could be avoided in all cases. However, if laryngeal edema has progressed and dyspnea occurs, injection of C1 inhibitor concentrate may come too late, and additional immediate emergency measures may become necessary to avoid asphyxiation. In any case, we recommend that HAE patients with laryngeal edema be treated with immediate intubation or even tracheostomy. We agree with Myers et al that “early intubation should be strongly considered in patients with HAE who manifest upper airway swelling.” In Germany C1 inhibitor concentrate is available; thus, we do not use fresh-frozen plasma for the treatment of laryngeal edema in HAE.\n\n【2】Coagulopathy, upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding because of gastric ulcers, and pneumonia are unusual complications of HAE.

{"seq_id": "595d6cac-e5aa-4086-8c57-dd7897617a6c", "title": "The Promise and Risk of Academic Medicine", "text": "【0】The Promise and Risk of Academic Medicine\nThose of us fortunate enough to work within an academic medical center share something unique in the world, but something that is endangered.\n\n【1】Academic medicine, as a concept, is poorly understood. People recognize that hospitals provide care. They know that medical schools teach students to become doctors. They have some idea of the role hospitals play in training house staff. They know that pharmaceutical companies play a major role in the research and development of new and better drugs. However, they are confused about who conducts this research and how research progresses. In fact, unless persons work in an academic medical center, they probably have little idea of how academic medicine brings together treatment, teaching, training, and research.\n\n【2】Social vs Fiscal Responsibility\n-------------------------------\n\n【3】I believe that academic medicine has become very fragile, in part because it is poorly understood. Because the clinical components of academic medical centers are more costly than those of not-for-profit and for-profit nonacademic centers, the academic medical centers have trouble competing against the less costly centers. Academic medical centers are essentially nonprofit entities that are responsible for many social goods, including concern for those in need, resolution of health care disparities, community responsiveness, and scholarship programs, to name only a few. While spending attention and resources on these issues, the academic medical center also must function in a fiscally responsible way. Overall, this creates formidable challenges for academic medical centers: to remain successful and responsive and to sustain productivity and function.\n\n【4】Unlike other health care centers, academic medical centers influence, and are influenced by, a wide variety of institutions, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the National Science Foundation, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. These agencies supply much of the financial support for medical research and dictate the policies affecting reimbursement throughout much of the process of health care delivery.\n\n【5】The practice of medicine relies on academic medical centers to train many of the people who deliver medical care in other venues. Vast public constituencies are critical to academic medicine, as is general public opinion. How the public regards the clinical practice of medicine in all settings may substantially influence their perception of academic medicine.\n\n【6】Academic medical institutions are of great consequence to patients and their families, who seek them for treatment of complicated medical conditions. Academic medical centers also have multiple and sensitive relationships with universities and private industries, eg, pharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, and insurance companies. I could extend this point, but it is understood. I describe it to stress the complicated nature of the mission and function of academic medical institutions. Those of us involved with academic medicine want and need our institutions to be understood and to be supported appropriately by the widest possible constituent community.\n\n【7】Academic medical centers have many strengths, not the least of which is their ability to assemble very talented people to both populate and lead them. These people have found imaginative and resourceful ways to secure revenues for the centers. Another strength of academic medical centers is the altruistic nature of their mission: helping people who are sick and advancing medicine to help even more people in the future with breakthrough discoveries. This mission attracts people for training, research, clinical, and administrative positions. However, despite their value and inherent strengths, academic medical centers are operating today in a challenging era, perhaps the most challenging in our nation's history.\n\n【8】I discuss some of the specific challenges to academic medicine and then reflect on how to respond to these challenges. Overall, we must communicate effectively to the American public the importance of academic medicine and ensure that we are listening to outside voices who offer important perspectives and critiques. Many of these voices can offer suggestions regarding how academic medicine can function better and become more responsive to public interests.\n\n【9】Challenges and Costs\n--------------------\n\n【10】What are some of the major problems facing academic medical centers? Certainly, money and the nation's financial situation are critical. The effects are omnipresent. However, simply considering a center's budget is not enough; of more relevance is how money is allocated, which is a measure of the importance or lack of importance being placed on academic medicine and its ability to provide care. For example, after the NIH budget doubled between 1998 and 2003, minuscule increases in subsequent years, including a 0.5% increase proposed for 2006 that reduces the total number of research grants by 402, threaten to undermine the benefit of the doubling and erode the nation's medical science effort.\n\n【11】The cost of health care is the central policy issue and one that has started to pit health care against other national and personal priorities. The $1.8 trillion spent on health care in the United States is a lot of money. Despite the great things we are doing for people—increasing longevity, improving treatments, curing diseases, reducing the onerous nature of medical interventions—the overriding issues of how much we can and should spend on health care and whether it is worth the price are influencing medicine throughout the country. Furthermore, the 45.8 million people\n\n【12】with no health care insurance in this country represent an agonizing situation. The issue of how to provide medical coverage and the form it should take, such as universal health care coverage, is the subject of continuing philosophical and economic debates, but little movement is occurring.\n\n【13】Obviously, closely related to the issue of expenses and reimbursements is the issue of capital funds. There are academic medical centers with good profitability margins and others with invisible margins. In some states, 50% to 70% of hospitals have no margin for patient care and operate in deficit.\n\n【14】The lack of margins affects the availability of capital money to maintain and to improve academic medical center buildings, usually of substantial size, and to update the rapidly changing technology for medicine.\n\n【15】People question the shortage of capital. How can money be scarce, given the many building projects seen around the country in medical centers? But medical centers are necessarily large. If they are not rehabilitated or renewed regularly, the result is antiquated structures. Furthermore, technology is improving so rapidly that to not have the latest generation of equipment or technology (imaging equipment, information technology, etc) is to undermine an institution's competitive position and deprive patients of the most recent developments in health care.\n\n【16】Workforce and Confidence\n------------------------\n\n【17】Woven into the economic issues is the fact that the medical field is experiencing crucial workforce shortages in an increasing number of disciplines. Workforce shortages are being seen among nurses, pharmacists, technicians, radiologists, obstetricians, and others. In contrast, in the early 1990s, many people said we may have too many doctors, and some spoke of ways of reducing the numbers. However, whether caused by malpractice insurance premiums deterring obstetricians and possibly neurosurgeons,\n\n【18】by the increasing workloads placed on nurses and doctors, by competition from better-paying non-health care jobs, or by the effect of ever-more regulation and bureaucracy, workforce issues have become increasingly important.\n\n【19】Because the solutions to such staffing shortages often involve better reimbursement, better incomes, or more expenditures for staff, they complicate the problem of the overall cost of health care.\n\n【20】More recently, the academic medical community has been disturbed by issues regarding the integrity of its own members, which has further hampered its ability to recruit the best to the profession. This was shown clearly in the intramural NIH debate regarding individual consulting relationships and conflicts of interest. When the NIH developed new policies to respond to the new environment, it substantially affected the morale of NIH staff and the ability of the NIH to recruit and retain scientists. James Battey, chair of the NIH Stem Cell Task Force and director of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, resigned. Other key employees resigned as well, and some recruits have balked at positions, given the new restrictions.\n\n【21】The NIH, in light of these developments, has indicated that it will need to adjust the new rules.\n\n【22】To the outside public, this is a question of confidence: Can we trust the integrity of the scientists paid to consult on drug and device development? To those in academic medicine, the question must be different: What do we have if we do not have the confidence of the public?\n\n【23】Science and Errors\n------------------\n\n【24】Public confidence also relates to the outcomes of science and to the issues that academic medicine chooses to examine, part of the ongoing tension between personal faith and scientific fact. In its April Fool's Day issue, _Scientific American_ published a spoof editorial in which it apologized for endorsing the theory of evolution just because it is the single “unifying concept for all of biology and one of the greatest scientific ideas of all time.” The editorial went on to state, “\\[W\\]e had no business being persuaded by mountains of evidence.” This spoof is based on some truth and on the actions of policy makers. In recent years, groups have attacked NIH-awarded grants on the basis of their view of the morality of the study. Changes have been suggested regarding applications, grants, and awards offered by NIH institutes for reasons seemingly based on politics and personal faith. These threats are ominous to a community that has been so productive by using a fundamental reliance on science and evidenced-based medicine.\n\n【25】Our own efforts to reaffirm the trust in our field are challenged by the number of errors in health care institutions. On the one hand, there is no human endeavor practiced without mistakes. The problem is that mistakes in medicine can be lethal. Thus, how we work with other entities to reduce errors and to make people less vulnerable is critical. This issue is wrapped up in the nature of the culture regarding the reporting of errors and near errors. We must ask ourselves whether the current culture is about finding cause to assign blame or allowing discussion to lead to a more rapid repair of systems.\n\n【26】Strategy for the Future\n-----------------------\n\n【27】Where does health care go from here? What should be the focus? How do we optimize what academic medicine does? I believe we need to establish the fact that the public's health care priorities are the same as those of academic medicine. Where we see them diverge, we strive for convergence. Where we see confusion, we promote understanding. Our goal should be to achieve a better understanding and appreciation of academic medicine by focusing on the issues of health care that directly affect patient care or that raise questions in the public about our ability to perform our mission. For example, collaboration between various people concerned about health care should be tightened considerably. The NIH and academe should collaborate on clinical and translational research. Some have suggested a surveillance process to follow Food and Drug Administration approval; such a process could enable us to more appropriately identify problems that arise post-approval. This effort would require collaboration among academic medicine, the NIH, and the Food and Drug Administration. Such surveillance could still allow early introduction of promising drugs while initiating a process that could more rapidly identify adverse effects that take time to manifest.\n\n【28】It is important to establish principles regarding collaborations between academics—whether at the NIH or at academic centers around the country—and outside companies. These principles should ensure that the relationships among collaboration participants remain ethical while allowing the benefits of the collaborations to be realized.\n\n【29】Collaboration is also necessary regarding the malpractice issue. We need agreement among health care professionals, consumers, families, lawyers, and government to secure real tort reform. People who are traumatized by medical errors should be compensated appropriately and in a timely way. However, we cannot afford the escalating malpractice premiums and settlements that threaten the viability of an increasing number of medical fields, which may be happening already in areas such as obstetrics.\n\n【30】Collaboration is needed as well among the various elements of government to develop legal protection to establish a culture with no blame. If health care staff believe they can report without being vilified or punished, they will come forward more often and more freely. As a result, clinicians will talk more openly about near misses and medical errors, which will enhance our ability to develop better systems to reduce such medical errors.\n\n【31】If we want continuing improvement of technology in medicine, there must be start-up capital and mechanisms of reimbursement to accommodate it. Government and medicine must work together to ensure timely reimbursement for new technology. Unfortunately, there is a gap between the time a new technology is established and when it is paid for. For example, one academic medical center decided it would not use novel technology until the government reimbursed for it. In such a circumstance, the losers are patients and innovation.\n\n【32】Although a market system is impractical in this setting, academic medicine needs to press for the tightest possible administration of health care. We must find ways to eliminate excessive costs, to learn efficiency techniques from other industrierö and to approach health care more systematically to reduce costs.\n\n【33】One way to vastly improve both quality and cost of care is for academe, insurers, employees, the government, and information technology companies to work together to expedite the development of an interconnected information system. Often, laboratory tests are performed and x-ray films are obtained repeatedly because a physician cannot access a patient's medical records. Information technology can provide immediate access to a patient's medical history under the patient's control and thereby avoid redundant and costly testing.\n\n【34】Collaboration is also needed among health care clinicians, educational entities, and the public to enhance the public's information regarding their health and preventive steps such as weight control and smoking cessation. The best primary care practitioner may be the patient herself or himself. More informed patients will likely be more responsive regarding their therapy. They will be far better partners with health care clinicians and will likely have better outcomes. Also, this scenario will likely lead to reduced costs. Important in this effort is heightened attention to health promotion, prevention, and early detection.\n\n【35】Many other policies should be advocated by collaborations among those concerned about health care and academic medicine, including the following: full health care coverage of the population; appropriate regular increases in NIH research dollars rather than wide budget swings; balanced and fair reimbursement across the various areas of medicine; elimination of health care disparities; greater focus on reimbursement for disease prevention; tort reform; training and development of appropriate medical workforce; greater support of clinical research and clinical researchers; and greater recruitment of minorities into health care professions. This is a long and complicated list, and doctors and scientists over the years have been reluctant to get involved. We and the nation cannot afford to be silent any longer. As a group, we must develop a stronger readiness among health care professionals to speak up on general health care policy.\n\n【36】The nation needs academic medicine to be productive, strong, and responsive. We must be good citizens. Who better than the people working in academic medicine to make the case for what we are about and why academic medical centers are important? Who better than us to explain why appropriate support, avoidance of overregulation, and balance in government oversight are critical for the health and productive functions of these cherished institutions?\n\n【37】We need leadership that will bring multiple perspectives together to help our nation develop its health care, academic medicine, and medical research to be maximally useful for the public. It may be time to consider the designation of, and provide authority to, a leadership position at the US Department of Health and Human Services for someone with credentials and experience in the health arena who can highlight the needs of health care vs the other needs in the department's vast portfolio. This candidate should have a thorough understanding of the people and enterprises involved with providing health care as well as a dedication to what is best for all our citizens. Obviously, this individual would not be able to perform this function alone but would need help from the US Department of Health and Human Services secretary, other administration leaders, congressional leadership, business leadership, the health care community, the citizen community, and many other segments of our society. In the end, strong informed leadership is critical to promoting the best for our country.\n\n【38】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【39】Academic medicine, in my opinion, is one of the most valuable entities in this country. It has played a central role in increasing longevity, reducing time from illness, and finding ways of relieving pain and suffering. It is also extremely important to the immediate surrounding community. An academic medical center is a beacon with wide illumination over the practice of medicine and health care in the surrounding community.\n\n【40】Academic medicine includes a marvelous integration of many functions. Students and residents learn while they treat. Doctors treat patients while they are in close contact with researchers to find better interventions. Educators, by being in the same institutions with scientists, are better able to keep up with the latest medicine.\n\n【41】We are not well understood, but there is a great need for us to make ourselves known. This will involve more appropriate collaboration with various institutions with whom we interact. People and institutions outside of academic medicine should assume responsibility for ensuring that the valuable functions that academic medical centers provide for the nation are continued in the most appropriate and effective fashion possible.\n\n【42】One aspect of the mission of academic medicine is the pursuit of excellence, ie, to be second to none. I have enjoyed my career in academic medicine enormously. I call for all of us to become more involved in ensuring that the social goods of academic medicine are ongoing, which may entail changes in the academic institutions. Ultimately, the most important criterion of our success will be our ability to serve the people and community in the most effective way.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The patient had a history of familial glomerosclerosis, which required renal transplantation 3 years earlier. His symptoms were unaffected by changes in diet. He noticed mucus in his stools, which appeared like flecks of tissue paper. He denied odynophagia, hematochezia, melena, pain with defecation, fever, or night sweats. The patient reported frequent travel to Europe in the 6 weeks before the onset of symptoms. He denied smoking, alcohol, or illicit drug use. His daily medications included mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, prednisone, and amlodipine.\n\n【1】Physical examination revealed a temperature of 36.6°C, a heart rate of 71 beats/min, and a blood pressure of 90/63 mm Hg. The patient was breathing comfortably on room air with a respiration rate of 18 breaths/min. His heart rhythm was regular, and his lungs were clear bilaterally. No peripheral edema was found. The abdomen was soft, nondistended, and nontender, with normoactive bowel sounds.\n\n【2】Laboratory data included the following (references ranges provided parenthetically): hemoglobin level, 16.2 g/dL (13.2-16.6 g/dL); white blood cell count, 4.7×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L ((3.4-9.6)×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L); platelet count, 201×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L ((135-317)×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L); sodium level, 133 mmol/L (135-145 mmol/L); potassium level, 3.0 mmol/L (3.6-5.2 mmol/L); chloride level, 104 mmol/L (98-107 mmol/L); HCO <sub>2 </sub> level, 11 mmol/L (22-29 mmol/L); blood urea nitrogen level, 107 mg/dL (8-24 mg/dL); creatinine level, 5.75 mg/dL (0.74-1.35 mg/dL); glucose level, 119 mg/dL (70-140 mg/dL); international normalized ratio, 1.12 (0.9-1.1); albumin level, 3.6 g/dL (3.5-5.0 g/dL); and total protein level, 6.0 g/dL (6.3-7.9 g/dL).\n\n【3】Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous (IV) contrast revealed a right lower quadrant renal transplant without hydronephrosis or other abnormalities.\n\n【4】*   1.\n\n【5】    **Which _one_ of the following was the _most likely_ cause of the patient’s initial clinical manifestations?**\n\n【6】    *   a.\n\n【7】        Ulcerative colitis\n\n【8】    *   b.\n\n【9】        Intestinal ischemia\n\n【10】    *   c.\n\n【11】        Infectious diarrhea\n\n【12】    *   d.\n\n【13】        Celiac disease\n\n【14】    *   e.\n\n【15】        Carcinoid syndrome\n\n【16】Our patient had no history of inflammatory bowel disease, and de novo ulcerative colitis without bleeding would be unlikely, especially in someone who was already taking immunosuppressants. Intestinal ischemia is caused by processes that reduce intestinal blood flow such as atherosclerosis and usually presents with severe abdominal pain. The absence of vascular disease or major cardiovascular risk factors in a patient with minimal abdominal discomfort does not support the diagnosis of ischemia. Given the new-onset, high-volume diarrhea, vomiting, and history of recent travel, the most likely etiology was infectious diarrhea. Diarrheal episodes are common after solid organ transplantation and may be caused by various organisms. Organ recipients are at high risk for infectious causes of diarrhea because of daily antirejection medications.\n\n【17】Celiac disease may cause chronic, large-volume diarrhea, and weight loss, but this is less likely given the acuteness of the patient’s symptoms and the lack of history of gluten intolerance. Carcinoid syndrome is unlikely, as the patient did not exhibit cutaneous flushing or wheezing along with diarrhea.\n\n【18】The patient was treated with IV fluids and his creatinine level improved, indicating severe prerenal injury from volume depletion. Stool studies including bacterial cultures and viral polymerase chain reaction panel was negative. The serum cytomegalovirus serologic test result was also negative. The stool ova and parasite study was positive for _Cryptosporidium_ .\n\n【19】*   2.\n\n【20】    **Which _one_ of the following was the _most appropriate_ antibiotic treatment for our patient?**\n\n【21】    *   a.\n\n【22】        Metronidazole\n\n【23】    *   b.\n\n【24】        Nitazoxanide\n\n【25】    *   c.\n\n【26】        Ciprofloxacin\n\n【27】    *   d.\n\n【28】        Albendazole\n\n【29】    *   e.\n\n【30】        Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole\n\n【31】Metronidazole is an antimicrobial within the nitroimidazole class, typically used in the treatment of mild to moderate cases of _Clostridium difficile_ as well as protozoal infections such as giardiasis. Nitazoxanide, a thiazole compound with broad activity against bacteria, viruses, and parasites, is currently the only Food and Drug Administration–approved drug for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis.\n\n【32】A review of the global burden, novel diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccine targets for _Cryptosporidium_ .\n\n【33】The recommended treatment length is 2 weeks, but may be prolonged to 4 to 6 weeks in immunocompromised patients.\n\n【34】Ciprofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone commonly used to treat bacterial causes of diarrhea such as _Escherichia coli_ and _Shigella_ . Albendazole is an antiparasitic medication used in the treatment of various worm infections including microsporidiosis. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is used to treat _Cyclospora_ or _Isospora._ None of the aforementioned agents with the exception of nitazoxanide are efficacious against _Cryptosporidium_ .\n\n【35】Our patient was treated with nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily; however, he continued to have large-volume diarrhea (4-8 L/d). As other infectious stool studies were negative, he was treated with loperamide and atropine/diphenoxylate as well as azithromycin 500 mg daily but the stool output remained unchanged.\n\n【36】*   3.\n\n【37】    **Which _one_ of the following was the _next best_ step in the patient’s care?**\n\n【38】    *   a.\n\n【39】        Computed tomography enterography\n\n【40】    *   b.\n\n【41】        Colonoscopy\n\n【42】    *   c.\n\n【43】        Supportive therapy and observation\n\n【44】    *   d.\n\n【45】        Abdominal ultrasound\n\n【46】    *   e.\n\n【47】        Hydrogen breath test\n\n【48】Computed tomography enterography is often used to diagnose small bowel neoplasms, unlikely the cause of our patient’s diarrhea given its acute nature. In our immunocompromised patient with persistent diarrhea despite treatment, colonoscopy with biopsies should be performed to rule out cytomegalovirus, _Mycobacterial avium complex_ , and other forms of inflammatory colitis. Supportive therapy is essential, but further work-up should be pursued in an immunocompromised patient with severe diarrhea who fails to improve with appropriate therapy. Abdominal ultrasonography is valuable in the evaluation of hepatic, biliary, and pancreatic pathology, but would not be diagnostically useful in our patient’s case as he has no signs of organ dysfunction in these systems. A hydrogen breath test is used to diagnose small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, a cause of chronic diarrhea. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is typically associated with intestinal motility disorders, diabetes, and previous small bowel surgery, none of which were part of our patient’s medical history. Therefore, a hydrogen breath test would not be useful at this time.\n\n【49】Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy revealed nonbleeding erosive ulcers in the gastric body and diffusely granular mucosa in the transverse colon. Biopsies revealed evidence of colitis with intraluminal microorganisms consistent with _Cryptosporidium_ and mild patchy crypt apoptosis. No granulomas or viral-type inclusions were seen. Congo red staining exhibited no evidence of amyloid.\n\n【50】*   4.\n\n【51】    **Which _one_ of the following medications on the patient’s medication list _most likely_ contributed to the patient’s persistent diarrhea?**\n\n【52】    *   a.\n\n【53】        Prednisone\n\n【54】    *   b.\n\n【55】        Nitazoxanide\n\n【56】    *   c.\n\n【57】        Amlodipine\n\n【58】    *   d.\n\n【59】        Mycophenolate mofetil\n\n【60】    *   e.\n\n【61】        Tacrolimus\n\n【62】Prednisone has no known association with diarrhea and is often used to treat diarrhea due to inflammatory causes. Nitazoxanide may cause abdominal pain and nausea, but not diarrhea. Amlodipine is known to cause constipation more commonly than diarrhea. The finding of crypt apoptosis on histology is most often associated with mycophenolate mofetil–induced colitis. Among the immunosuppressive agents used in solid organ transplantation, mycophenolate mofetil is also most frequently associated with persistent diarrhea.\n\n【63】Tacrolimus has been associated with mild diarrhea and abdominal discomfort, but is not known to cause changes in the intestinal mucosa.\n\n【64】Mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued, and over the next few days, the patient’s stool output improved to approximately 1 L/d. He continued to receive IV fluids to match stool output, and his creatinine level returned to baseline. However, he exhibited worsening edema progressing to anasarca. His serum albumin and total protein levels decreased slowly throughout the hospitalization, with the albumin level reaching a nadir of 1.9 g/dL (RR, 3.5-5.0 g/dL) and the total protein level 3.6 g/dL (RR, 6.3-7.9 g/dL). He had a good caloric intake, and no proteinuria was seen on urine studies.\n\n【65】*   5.\n\n【66】    **Which _one_ of the following laboratory tests would be _most useful_ in diagnosing the cause of the patient’s hypoalbuminemia?**\n\n【67】    *   a.\n\n【68】        Fecal lactoferrin\n\n【69】    *   b.\n\n【70】        Fecal calprotectin\n\n【71】    *   c.\n\n【72】        Fecal fat\n\n【73】    *   d.\n\n【74】        Fecal reducing substances\n\n【75】    *   e.\n\n【76】        Fecal alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT)\n\n【77】Fecal lactoferrin and calprotectin are markers of inflammation that are often elevated in severe gastrointestinal infections and disease such as inflammatory bowel disease. However, inflammatory bowel disease was unlikely given the absence of suggestive findings on biopsy. Levels of fecal fat are increased in the stool in malabsorptive conditions such as pancreatic insufficiency, celiac disease, and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Fecal reducing substances are used to diagnose lactose deficiency and other causes of disaccharidase deficiencies. Neither test would fully explain the low levels of serum protein and albumin.\n\n【78】Alpha-1 antitrypsin intestinal clearance is the primary test to diagnose protein-losing enteropathy, which was clinically suspected given the patient’s gradual hypoalbuminemia, hypoproteinemia, edema, and lack of proteinuria. Alpha-1 antitrypsin has high molecular weight, is minimally degraded in the gut, and is excreted in an intact form. Its clearance is calculated by 24-hour stool collection and comparison to the serum values.\n\n【79】Stool collection indicated elevated A1AT clearance, confirming the diagnosis of protein-losing enteropathy, and a low-fat, high-protein, medium-chain triglyceride diet was initiated. The patient continued to improve and, at the time of discharge, had only 1 to 2 episodes of diarrhea daily and no abdominal pain or other symptoms. Nitazoxanide and azithromycin were continued for 8 weeks given the patient’s diffuse intestinal disease and immunosuppressed state. At follow-up in the outpatient clinic after the completion of the antibiotic course, the patient’s symptoms had fully resolved.\n\n【80】Discussion\n----------\n\n【81】Diarrhea is a frequent complication after solid organ transplantation, with approximately 20% of patients having it in the first 3 years.\n\n【82】Compared with the nontransplanted population, there is a higher likelihood of opportunistic infections and rare causes of diarrhea. The most common infectious pathogens are _Norovirus_ and _C difficile_ . However, other common pathogens include _Cytomegalovirus_ , _Salmonella_ , and parasites such as _Cryptosporidium_ as seen in our patient.\n\n【83】Within the _Cryptosporidium_ genus, _Cryptosprodium parvum_ is the most common species that affects humans. It has a ubiquitous geographical distribution and wide host range. _Cryptospora_ typically spread in outbreaks of waterborne infections, with as few as 30 microscopic oocysts possibly leading to infection. Cryptosporidiosis accounts for up to 6% of all diarrheal diseases in immunocompetent individuals and up to 24% cases in those with AIDS; however, its incidence is unknown in those with solid organ transplant.\n\n【84】In healthy individuals, cryptosporidiosis is typically self-limiting, but it may be life-threatening in the immunocompromised who has copious diarrhea with subsequent volume depletion, electrolyte abnormalities, acute kidney injury, and fluctuating levels of antirejection drugs. Other clinical manifestations include nausea and/or vomiting, fever, and abdominal pain.\n\n【85】The mainstay of treatment of cryptosporidiosis is supportive therapy through oral and IV volume repletion, but antidiarrheal agents may be used after other infectious causes have been excluded. To date, there are no randomized clinical trials of the efficacy of antiparasitic drugs in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in solid organ transplant recipients. Most current data are extrapolated from studies of immunocompetent hosts or patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection.\n\n【86】Nitazoxanide, a thiazole compound with broad activity against bacteria, viruses, and parasites, is currently the only Food and Drug Administration–approved drug for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis.\n\n【87】A review of the global burden, novel diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccine targets for _Cryptosporidium_ .\n\n【88】In immunocompromised hosts, antimicrobial therapy is administered for 2 weeks or longer, depending on the clinical response. In patients with more severe disease and minimal response to a single agent, combination therapy and a longer duration of treatment may be considered. Nitazoxanide in combination with azithromycin has been found to significantly suppress the growth of _Cryptosporidium_ in vitro.\n\n【89】This regimen used for 4 to 6 weeks resulted in clinical improvement and eradication of the parasite in a case series of patients with renal and hematopoietic cell transplant.\n\n【90】Diagnosis and treatment of digestive cryptosporidiosis in allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients: a prospective single centre study.\n\n【91】Noninfectious causes must also be considered in patients with solid organ transplant, with the most common being drug-induced, particularly considering that most immunosuppressive therapies used in antitransplant rejection are associated with diarrhea. Tacrolimus and azathioprine are known to cause gut irritation; however, gastrointestinal adverse effects associated with these medications are typically mild and rarely require drug discontinuation.\n\n【92】The highest incidence of diarrhea related to antirejection medication is associated with mycophenolate mofetil, which is believed to cause direct enterocyte damage. Characteristic histological features of mycophenolate mofetil enteritis include crypt apoptosis, presence of apoptotic bodies, and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates,\n\n【93】Histologic features of mycophenolate mofetil-related colitis: a graft-versus-host disease-like pattern.\n\n【94】some of which were seen in our patient’s biopsy. Treatment involves cessation of the drug, after which swift clinical improvement is often seen.\n\n【95】Lastly, throughout hospitalization, our patient had protein-losing enteropathy leading to hypoalbuminemia and edema. There have been case reports of protein-losing enteropathies associated with _C difficile_ infections, as well as parasitic infections such as _Giardia lamblia_ and _Strongyloides stercoralis_ .\n\n【96】Severe infections may cause erosive gastrointestinal disease, leading to leakage of protein-rich fluids across the eroded epithelium. Diagnosis can be confirmed via measurement of A1AT levels in the stool. Management involves treatment of the underlying cause with initial dietary adjustments using a high-protein, low-fat, medium-chain triglyceride diet. These dietary modifications may beneficially affect albumin metabolism and diminish the need for lymphatic transport of fatty acids, thus decreasing pressure on the lymphatic system and preventing lymph leakage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Mean (SE) brachial PP decreased from 43.5 (0.5) to 40.5 (0.6) mm Hg from the lowest to the highest quartiles of 24-hour urinary caffeine excretion ( _P_ <.001). The odds ratio (95% CI) of high PP decreased linearly from 1.0 to 0.52 (0.31-0.89), 0.38 (0.22-0.65), and 0.31 (0.18-0.55) from the lowest to the highest quartile of 24-hour urinary caffeine excretion ( _P_ <.001). Mean (SE) PWV in the highest caffeine excretion quartile was significantly lower than in the lowest quartile (7.8 \\[0.1\\] vs 8.1 \\[0.1\\] m/s; _P_ \\=.03). Similar associations were found for paraxanthine and theophylline, whereas no associations were found with theobromine.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Urinary caffeine, paraxanthine, and theophylline excretions were associated with decreased parameters of arterial stiffness, suggesting a protective effect of caffeine intake beyond its blood pressure–lowering effect.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AI ( augmentation index ), AP ( augmentation pressure ), BMI ( body mass index ), BP ( blood pressure ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), GFR ( glomerular filtration rate ), PP ( pulse pressure ), PWV ( pulse wave velocity ), SKIPOGH ( Swiss Kidney Project on Genes and Hypertension )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Dementia syndrome is one of the leading causes of disability among older adults, yet it remains vastly underdiagnosed. A timely diagnosis of dementia is essential to ensuring optimal care and support of individuals and their loved ones. Although there is no single test for dementia, health care providers can use a structured approach to the workup and management of new cognitive symptoms. Comprehensive MEDLINE and PubMed searches were performed to develop an unbiased, practical diagnostic approach to these symptoms. This review guides primary care providers in the workup, diagnosis, delivery, and initial management of patients presenting with new cognitive symptoms.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AChEI ( acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ), AD ( Alzheimer disease ), CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ), CT ( computerized tomography ), DSM ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ), FAST ( Functional Assessment Staging ), MCI ( mild cognitive impairment ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ), NCD ( neurocognitive disorder ), PD ( Parkinson disease )\n\n【4】Dementia represents one of the largest global public health challenges facing modern society. Data from the World Health Organization suggests that 50 million individuals worldwide struggle with dementia; this number is expected to triple in the next 30 years.\n\n【5】Dementia is the most common cause of disability among older adults due to affected individuals’ gradual loss of independence and progressive increase in neuropsychologic symptoms. This syndrome poses an enormous emotional and financial burden on family care partners who provide more than $200 billion in uncompensated care annually.\n\n【6】As a comorbidity, dementia increases the costs of delivering care by nearly 50% when it coexists with other chronic conditions such as diabetes and coronary artery disease.\n\n【7】The impact of dementia on patients, their loved ones, and their communities is far reaching, making it critical for all health care teams to recognize the signs and symptoms of early dementia and to develop effective diagnostic and management skills. Despite this clinical imperative, delays in the diagnosis of dementia remain common, with most individuals suffering with symptoms for an average of 3 to 5 years before the diagnosis is made.\n\n【8】Caregivers' perspectives on the pre-diagnostic period in early onset dementia: a long and winding road.\n\n【9】Fewer than 50% of individuals ever receive a formal diagnosis, placing an enormous emotional toll of anxiety on both individuals with dementia and their families.\n\n【10】Psychosocial factors that shape patient and carer experiences of dementia diagnosis and treatment: a systematic review of qualitative studies.\n\n【11】Most importantly, without a diagnosis, education, or action planning, older adults with cognitive impairment are at high risk for crisis-driven management such as acute hospitalizations, critical care unit admissions, and premature institutionalization.\n\n【12】Mild cognitive impairment and risk of critical illness.\n\n【13】Mild cognitive impairment with associated inflammatory and cortisol alterations as independent risk factor for postoperative delirium.\n\n【14】This clinical review aims to provide front-line clinicians with a practical, evidence-based approach to managing the patient with new cognitive symptoms in the ambulatory care setting. For this review, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE and Ovid PsycINFO, PubMed from 1946 to April 15, 2019, including the terms _cognitive disorders_ , _cognitive dysfunction_ , _dementia_ , _primary health care_ , _diagnosis_ , _geriatric assessment_ , and _neurocognitive tests_ to develop an unbiased focus on the diagnostic approach to cognitive impairment.\n\n【15】Diagnostic Criteria and Definitions\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】Published in 2013, the _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition_ (DSM-5) offered several substantive changes over the DSM-4.\n\n【17】Specifically, dementia was renamed major neurocognitive disorder (major NCD) and the term mild neurocognitive disorder (mild NCD, also called mild cognitive impairment \\[MCI\\]) was added to acknowledge earlier manifestations of cognitive change. Respective terms are equivalent and can be used interchangeably. The purpose of this change in nomenclature was two-fold: to reduce social stigma and to encapsulate the myriad of etiologies and manifestations of cognitive impairment. This version also described two new cognitive domains that can be affected by dementia: complex attention and social cognition. Cognitive domains detailed in the DSM-5 are listed in Table 1 .\n\n【18】Table 1 DSM-5 Cognitive Domains\n\n【19】DSM-5 = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition.\n\n【20】Derived from the American Psychiatric Association.\n\n| Cognitive domain | Capacities |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complex attention | Selective attention, processing speed |\n| Executive function | Planning, organization, decision making |\n| Learning and memory | Encoding new information, free and cued recall |\n| Language | Word finding, naming, grammar, and syntax |\n| Perceptual-motor function | Visual perception, visuoconstructional reasoning, perceptual-motor coordination |\n| Social cognition | Awareness of one’s own emotions and insight of other’s perception of oneself | a DSM-5 = _Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition_ .\n\n【22】The diagnosis of dementia (major NCD) requires one to have a decline from a previous level of functioning in one or more cognitive domains which interferes with daily function and independence. Memory impairment is no longer a required criterion. The progressive decline must not be due to delirium or other mental health conditions. MCI (also known as mild NCD) is an intermediate clinical state characterized by an objective decrease in cognitive functioning that does not interfere with one’s ability to participate in complex activities, although greater effort or time may be required.\n\n【23】The National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association (NIA-AA) developed separate diagnostic recommendations to allow for clinical decision making and to provide a common diagnostic lexicon for future Alzheimer disease research. This 2011 guideline described three phases of Alzheimer disease (AD): preclinical AD, mild cognitive or prodromal AD, and dementia caused by AD. These phases are further classified based upon biomarkers found in the cerebrospinal (CSF) fluid, such as β-amyloid and pathologic tau, shifting the definition of AD to a biological construct. Whereas these biomarkers are not yet a recommended part of the initial workup of uncomplicated cognitive impairment, the NIA-AA guidelines form the foundation of future neurocognitive research on the diagnosis of dementia.\n\n【24】NIA-AA research framework: toward a biological definition of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n【25】Subtypes\n--------\n\n【26】AD remains the most common of the neurodegenerative conditions causing dementia, comprising 70% to 80% of dementia cases. However, given the prevalence of dementia with Lewy bodies, vascular dementia, and frontotemporal dementias, these subtypes are also common to the primary care practice. Mixed dementia with features of multiple subtypes is also common. Distinctive clinical features have been described with each of these syndromes .\n\n【27】Table 2 Dementia Subtypes\n\n| Subtype | Presenting clinical features | Structural imaging features (CT/MRI)aAD = Alzheimer disease; CT = computed tomography; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; PD = Parkinson disease; REM = rapid eye movement. |\n| --- | --- | --- | a AD = Alzheimer disease; CT = computed tomography; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging; PD = Parkinson disease; REM = rapid eye movement.\n\n【29】Risk Factors\n------------\n\n【30】Given the heterogeneity of dementia, risk factors vary for different subtypes of the syndrome and can be categorized as nonmodifiable and modifiable. Age is the most important nonmodifiable risk factor for developing any subtype of dementia. Genetic risk factors have been well studied in AD. Having one parent with dementia doubles one’s risk; however, this risk declines with advancing parental age at the time of diagnosis.\n\n【31】Parental family history of dementia in relation to subclinical brain disease and dementia risk.\n\n【32】Early-onset AD is rare and typically follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Late-onset AD is influenced by a more complicated set of genetic factors, with apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 being the most firmly established genetic risk factor.\n\n【33】Modifiable risk factors can be categorized into those impacting individuals in early life (age <18 years), midlife (age 45 to 64 years), and later life (age >65 years) based on estimates of the population attributable fraction. The most notable early-life risk factor is lower educational attainment, defined as no secondary school education.\n\n【34】Dementia prevention, intervention, and care.\n\n【35】Midlife risk factors include uncontrolled hypertension, smoking, severe brain injury, and obesity. Hearing loss has also been recently identified as a highly prevalent modifiable risk factor.\n\n【36】Hearing Impairment and Incident Dementia and Cognitive Decline in Older Adults: The Health ABC Study.\n\n【37】Later-life risk factors such as smoking, depression, sedentary lifestyle,\n\n【38】Physical activity and risk of cognitive decline: a meta-analysis of prospective studies.\n\n【39】social isolation, and diabetes are associated with increased risk of developing multiple subtypes of dementia.\n\n【40】Dementia prevention, intervention, and care.\n\n【41】Screening Versus a Timely Diagnosis\n-----------------------------------\n\n【42】The most recent recommendation from the US Preventive Services Taskforces (USPSTF) states that current data are insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening for dementia. USPSTF provides additional clarification around this statement, stating that this screening recommendation is focused on those adults aged 65 years and older who do not have any signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment.\n\n【43】Conversely, prompt recognition of new cognitive symptoms that interfere with social, occupational, or other daily life functions and resultant workup comprises a “timely diagnosis.”\n\n【44】The primary care diagnosis of dementia in Europe: an analysis using multidisciplinary, multinational expert groups.\n\n【45】A timely diagnosis allows patients and care partners to work closely with their health care teams to build upon existing capacities, anticipate future challenges, and assemble care partnering and caregiving systems. Early recognition also allows for the development of safe, patient-centered care plans that aim to prevent crisis-driven management decisions in the acute care setting. To achieve this, clinicians must be attuned to the early symptoms and signs of dementia. Clinical changes may be first recognized by the patient, spouse, or other informant. These changes may occur in one or more domains including retention of new information, ability to manage complex tasks, ability to cope with unexpected events, difficulty with word finding, changes in personal or social behavior, or challenges in spatial ability.\n\n【46】Making the Diagnosis\n--------------------\n\n【47】### Clinical History\n\n【48】The goals of any evaluation should be to first acknowledge the patient/caregiver concerns, objectively identify cognitive decline, document functional status, and discern whether an underlying neurodegenerative disorder or other medical or psychiatric cause is present. Clinical concern of a change in cognitive function is important to describe, in line with diagnostic criteria described earlier. In particular, it is important to clarify whether cognitive concern is associated with functional implications. Important information can be gathered from the moment the patient arrives for the visit. For example, patients missing or arriving late for appointments, arriving unkempt, or having no or little knowledge of medications may indicate a problem. As function becomes impaired due to cognitive decline, the ensuing safety consequences, both for the person themselves and also for the general public, must be discussed. Is the patient cooking on an open flame? Is the patient a driver? Are they still able to manage their own medications? Typically, basic activities of daily living are maintained until later in the course; however, instrumental activities, such as financial management, may be affected early on. The Functional Activities Questionnaire is one questionnaire which can be used to assess Instrumental Activities of Daily Living function and can later be used to track progression.\n\n【49】### Physical Examination\n\n【50】Performing a mental status examination forms the core of the examination of a patient presenting with cognitive concerns. Components of the mental status examination include appearance, behavior, motor activity, mood/affect, thought process/content, perception, insight, cognition, and judgement.\n\n【51】The physical examination should be comprehensive, with special focus on the neurologic examination which may help characterize the etiology of cognitive impairment . For example, one may be able to identify clinical features of parkinsonism, gait impairment, frontal signs, or evidence of prior stroke. Cardiovascular examination should be tailored to vascular risks and also look for orthostatic hypotension. Other areas of focus on clinical examination may depend on concerns raised from the clinical history; for example, a history of unintentional significant weight loss in the context of cognitive decline would warrant a review for underlying malignancy.\n\n【52】### Cognitive Testing\n\n【53】There is a myriad of cognitive tests available. With the introduction of the annual wellness visit in 2011 and its recommendation to assess cognition, the Alzheimer’s Association convened a workgroup to develop recommendations to help guide primary care providers.\n\n【54】Alzheimer's Association recommendations for operationalizing the detection of cognitive impairment during the medicare annual wellness visit in a primary care setting.\n\n【55】Within this, they recommended an initial structured assessment to serve as a baseline or to trigger further evaluation. To provide clarity for providers in selecting an initial cognitive assessment screening tool, the workgroup sought to identify tools that would be quick to administer, validated in primary care, easy to administer by nonclinical staff, and free of charge and bias. An example of one such tool is the Mini-Cog, which tests 3-item recall and a clock draw test. When choosing a cognitive assessment tool, providers should ensure it has been validated in the population being seen. For example, the Mini-Cog has been validated in many different populations.\n\n【56】Validation and cultural adaptation of the Arabic versions of the Mini-Mental Status Examination - 2 and Mini-Cog test.\n\n【57】The Alzheimer’s Association workgroup does note that other tools can be used at the “discretion of the clinician.” As noted, these initial brief tests help to risk stratify, not to follow the patient longitudinally, and if abnormal, indicate the need for further mental status testing. The USPTF examined instruments which could be administered by a provider in less than 10 minutes or be self-administered in 20 minutes.\n\n【58】Evidence summary: cognitive impairment in older adults: screening.\n\n【59】The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was the most commonly studied.\n\n【60】However, this is now a proprietary test, which has limited its widespread use. Also, it is less effective at distinguishing cognitively healthy from people with MCI\n\n【61】The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA: a brief screening tool for mild cognitive impairment.\n\n【62】and is influenced by age and education.\n\n【63】The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is another commonly used and validated test, which also has the advantage of being available in several languages other than English. It takes approximately 10 minutes to administer and is a 30-point test which assesses domains of visuospatial/executive function, naming, attention, language, memory, delayed recall, orientation, and abstraction.\n\n【64】The Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA: a brief screening tool for mild cognitive impairment.\n\n【65】Normal score range is 26 or greater with allowance made for educational status of the patient. Health care providers are required to be trained and certified to use the Montreal Cognitive Assessment through the online standardized training and certification test.\n\n【66】An alternative option is the Short Test of Mental Status, a 38-point cognitive test that has been validated in dementia cohorts and tests orientation, attention, immediate recall, arithmetic, abstraction, construction, information, and delayed recall. A score of 29 or less is suggestive of underlying dementia.\n\n【67】Whatever test is used, the results should be considered, along with the history and examination, to help guide the need for further testing.\n\n【68】In some situations, referral for formal neuropsychologic testing is indicated to further characterize the cognitive deficits and confirm the diagnosis, for example, in younger patients, atypical presentations, cases of rapid cognitive decline, or where there is a question of current functional capacity. Formal neuropsychologic testing can add helpful insight into the etiology of the diagnosis and help determine functional limitations.\n\n【69】Cognitive screening tests versus comprehensive neuropsychological test batteries: a National Academy of Neuropsychology Education Paperdagger.\n\n【70】The American Academy of Neurology practice guideline update on MCI recommends further assessment such as with neuropsychologic testing for those who have scores indicating MCI on brief cognitive tests because brief cognitive tests are usually more sensitive than specific.\n\n【71】Practice guideline update summary: mild cognitive impairment: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n【72】They also recommend referral to a specialist if the provider is inexperienced in dealing with patients with cognitive impairment. Formal neuropsychologic testing takes several hours to complete. Hence, consideration for the patient’s ability to participate in this testing, particularly taking into account the stage of cognitive impairment at which they may have presented to primary care, other comorbidities, their goals of care, and certainty of diagnosis may influence the decision to refer for neuropsychologic testing.\n\n【73】### Differential Diagnosis\n\n【74】In the evaluation of a patient with new cognitive symptoms, the clinician must be attuned to the possibility of other non-dementia conditions that can also present with cognitive symptoms. A thorough history, establishment of time course, and physical examination are critical first steps in this evaluation.\n\n【75】Identification of depression is an important consideration in older adults with cognitive symptoms, as it is well established that depression is highly prevalent among older adults, and is associated with poorer cognition and quality of life. Depression has been recognized as both a risk factor and a prodromal syndrome for dementia.\n\n【76】Trajectories of depressive symptoms before diagnosis of dementia: a 28-year follow-up study.\n\n【77】Several factors challenge one’s ability to make the diagnosis of depression in dementia including older adults’ tendency to present with atypical mood symptoms, limited ability to convey emotional symptoms, and the fact that standard assessment tools often require the patient to recall recent symptom burden. Tools such as the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale offer higher sensitivity for detection of depression in dementia as both require input from a care partner or collateral historian.\n\n【78】Although no clear time frame has been defined, in patients for whom first symptom onset to development of dementia encompasses less than a year (oftentimes on the order of weeks to months), attention to causes of rapidly progressive dementia and an ensuing wide differential should be considered. It is important to exclude delirium as an alternative diagnosis in patients who present with rapid onset of cognitive impairment.\n\n【79】One commonly used mnemonic for the differential of rapidly progressive cognitive symptoms is the acronym VITAMINS. This stands for vascular, infectious, toxic-metabolic, autoimmune, metastases/neoplasm-related, iatrogenic, neurodegenerative, and systemic/seizures/structural etiologies that should be considered when symptoms are rapidly progressive.\n\n【80】### Laboratory Studies\n\n【81】Standard laboratory evaluation of the patient with new cognitive impairment is directed toward identifying medical illness that can cause or contribute to these symptoms. Current consensus in the literature and guidelines support initially obtaining thyroid function tests and a vitamin B12 level.\n\n【82】Practice parameter: diagnosis of dementia (an evidence-based review).

Consensus statement of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, the Alzheimer's Association, and the American Geriatrics Society.\n\n【85】Based on individual considerations, overnight oximetry, complete blood count, electrolyte panel, HIV, and syphilis testing may also be warranted.\n\n【86】In patients younger than 55 years with cognitive impairment, those with a rapidly progressive disease course, atypical dementia syndromes, or those who are immunosuppressed, CSF examination is warranted to exclude infection, malignancy, and neuroinflammation.\n\n【87】Routinely obtaining CSF biomarkers, such as tau and amyloid beta 1-42 in AD\n\n【88】CSF biomarker changes precede symptom onset of mild cognitive impairment.\n\n【89】CSF biomarkers and incipient alzheimer disease in patients with mild cognitive impairment.\n\n【90】in the primary care evaluation of patients with cognitive impairment is currently not recommended for diagnostic purposes.\n\n【91】Practice guideline update summary: mild cognitive impairment.\n\n【92】However, this remains an area of active research and, in the correct clinical context, CSF biomarkers may provide insight into the underlying cause. Although specific biomarkers differ among the dementia syndromes, their potential to allow preclinical diagnosis, monitor disease progression, and indicate underlying pathology remains promising.\n\n【93】Biomarkers in dementia: clinical utility and new directions.\n\n【94】Novel panel of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for the prediction of progression to Alzheimer dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment.\n\n【95】### Imaging Studies\n\n【96】Structural imaging of the brain (computed tomography \\[CT\\] or magnetic resonance imaging \\[MRI\\]) is recommended by most national guidelines when evaluating patients for dementia. It is important to rule out secondary causes of cognitive impairment such as tumor, normal pressure hydrocephalus, stroke, and associated vascular disease, demyelination, or chronic infection.\n\n【97】Practice parameter: diagnosis of dementia (an evidence-based review). Report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n【98】Practice guideline update summary: mild cognitive impairment.\n\n【99】MRI is generally preferred over CT due to greater sensitivity for various pathologies and lack of exposure to ionizing radiation. However, CT remains a reasonable option if a patient is unable to tolerate MRI or in the acute setting evaluation when hemorrhage or stroke must be ruled out quickly. Noncontrast imaging is usually adequate for routine evaluation of patients with suspected cognitive impairment, whereas intravenous contrast should be considered when there is a concern for CNS infection, neoplasm, or in patients with unexplained neurologic deficits.\n\n【100】Although imaging findings vary across dementia syndromes , cerebral atrophy to a greater extent of that seen in normal aging is characteristic of neurodegenerative dementia. Patterns and degree of brain atrophy correlate with positive predictive values for different dementia syndromes and are incorporated into diagnostic criteria.\n\n【101】In AD, brain atrophy correlates with both tau deposition as well as neuropsychologic deficits and at the cognitive impairment stage, the degree of medial temporal structure atrophy, including the hippocampus, are suggestive of AD.\n\n【102】Functional brain imaging is an area of ongoing evolution. Modalities of 18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography using specific tracers reveal areas of brain hypometabolism and hypoperfusion, respectively, which can be seen in distinctive patterns among dementia syndromes. Several positron-emission tomography tracers that bind to and label specific proteins (fibrillar amyloid and tau) allow for in vivo evaluation of the molecular pathology underlying dementia subtypes (such as AD).\n\n【103】Biomarkers in dementia: clinical utility and new directions.\n\n【104】Although an area of active research, these modalities currently have limited clinical utility in primary care evaluation as the imaging techniques are costly and require substantial expertise to perform and interpret.\n\n【105】### Dementia Subtype\n\n【106】Based on the clinical history, mental status examination, physical examination, and laboratory and imaging studies, the clinician can postulate the subtype of dementia. Key clinical and imaging features of common dementia subtypes are listed in Table 2 . Understanding the subtype of dementia can inform treatment decisions, prognosis, and anticipatory guidance. With the future advancement of functional imaging and biologic markers of dementia, clinicians will be able to determine the dementia subtype with more certainty.\n\n【107】Delivering the Diagnosis\n------------------------\n\n【108】Although awareness of dementia is increasing, we know that historic rates of diagnosis are low, particularly in primary care.\n\n【109】Physician recognition of cognitive impairment: evaluating the need for improvement.\n\n【110】Barriers to making a timely diagnosis include time constraints in a limited office visit where there may be many other things to address, perceived futility of making a diagnosis with little treatment options available, under-recognition of a problem by family,\n\n【111】Frequency and characteristics of silent dementia among elderly Japanese-American men. The Honolulu-Asia Aging Study.\n\n【112】and lack of prior provider experience in dealing with dementia.\n\n【113】Factors associated with primary care physicians' recognition of cognitive impairment in their older patients.\n\n【114】One strategy which may be helpful when cognitive concerns are raised is to schedule a family meeting or dedicated visit with a collateral historian present.\n\n【115】At the dedicated visit, the clinician should communicate the diagnosis to the patient and family in a clear, compassionate, and straightforward manner. At this visit, the clinician can assess how much information the patient and family are ready to hear and accordingly provide information about potential interventions and prognosis. This discussion is often iterative and longitudinal given the changing needs of the individual with a dementia syndrome. Tools and video tutorials for making and delivering the diagnosis of dementia are available to clinicians on the ACT on Alzheimer’s webpage.\n\n【116】Once a diagnosis of dementia is made, there are additional factors that should be assessed and documented. Safety concerns go hand-in-hand with cognitive and functional decline and should be addressed by the primary care provider early on and at follow-up visits to troubleshoot and prevent crises where possible. This includes discussions about medication management, striving to keep regimens as simple as possible with clear communication of changes to caregivers, use of pill box or packs, and avoidance or minimizing medications that could adversely affect cognition further. With cognitive decline comes physical decline, especially if there is underlying parkinsonism or cerebrovascular disease which will increase the risk for falls. Driving is also an important and often contentious topic; however, driving capacity must be discussed openly.\n\n【117】State-by-state variations in driving regulations and reporting exist and providers should be familiar with those in their own jurisdiction. The American Academy of Neurology has identified strategies to help with decision making on when to advise driving cessation including identifying the stage of cognitive impairment with the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, taking into account caregiver concerns, prior accidents, behavioral symptoms such as impulsivity, an MMSE score of less than 24, and self-reported driving restrictions.\n\n【118】Cognitive Assessment Billing and Coding\n---------------------------------------\n\n【119】Driven by the Health Outcomes, Planning and Education for Alzheimer’s Act, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid developed a Current Procedural Terminology code (99483) which provides reimbursement to eligible billing providers for the comprehensive care of patients with dementia. Although Centers for Medicare and Medicaid does not require the use of specific assessment tools, it does require a multidimensional assessment including cognition, function, safety, evaluation of neuropsychiatric or behavioral symptoms, medication review, and caregiver assessment. The details of this assessment are included in Table 3 . It is recommended that this assessment be documented in the form of a care plan that addresses current needs and recommended community resources available to the patient and caregiver.\n\n【120】Table 3 Cognitive Assessment and Care Planning Services: Current Procedural Terminology Code 99483 Requirements\n\n| Clinical domain | Examples |\n| --- | --- |\n| Assessment of cognition | Pertinent history and examination |\n| Functional assessment | Capacity to perform basic and instrumental activities of daily living |\n| Stage of dementia | Functional Assessment Screening Tool or Clinical Dementia Rating |\n| Medication review | Medication reconciliation and minimization of high risk medications |\n| Neuropsychiatric symptoms | Burden of symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, apathy, depression, and agitation |\n| Safety evaluation | Discussion of driving capacity, financial capacity, and risk for abuse |\n| Caregiver assessment | Recognition of caregiver needs and connection to community-based services such as caregiver coaching and respite care |\n| Advance care planning | Identification of a surrogate decision maker, discussion, and documentation of health care preferences at current and future states of function |\n\n【122】Elements may be evaluated in one or more visits. This code should not be reported more frequently than once every 180 days.\n\n【123】Partnership and Prognosis\n-------------------------\n\n【124】Patients, care partners, and primary care providers must work closely with hospital-based and subspecialty providers to prevent crisis-driven management during transitions of care. Clear documentation in the electronic medical record by the primary care provider can be very helpful in communicating the patient's baseline status and preferences. We recommend documentation of the functional status or stage of dementia. Tools that can be helpful for this include the Functional Assessment Screening Tool (FAST) which describes on a 1 to 7 scale the functional, verbal, and physical abilities of the patient with dementia.\n\n【125】Documentation of the FAST stage can be helpful for longitudinally tracking progression. We also recommend having a clear outline of the patient's goals and their surrogate medical decision maker present to avoid unnecessary and nonbeneficial testing in this vulnerable population. This documentation serves as the patient’s voice and can assist social service and palliative and acute care providers when patients are in the hospital setting.\n\n【126】When cognitive impairment is identified, a typical question for the primary care provider, from either the patient of caregiver, concerns prognosis, which, as is the case in many other illnesses, can be challenging to predict. For patients diagnosed with MCI, not all cases are early dementia and progression rates to dementia can vary between 8% and 15% per year.\n\n【127】Studies of patients with MCI show that progression rates to dementia can vary depending on factors such as the population studied, MCI subtype, functional status, and age.\n\n【128】Higher risk of progression to dementia in mild cognitive impairment cases who revert to normal.\n\n【129】The trajectory of dementia is variable depending on the patient and disease factors, but inevitably the trajectory is one of decline, particularly in the last year of life where there is progressive functional and cognitive decline.\n\n【130】Various tools have been used to prognosticate in dementia, probably the best known of which is the FAST, which can also be used to assess hospice eligibility in AD.\n\n【131】The primary care provider is perfectly positioned to begin goals of care discussions and introduce the role of palliative care in dementia. Palliative care focuses on pain and non-pain symptom management, spiritual and psychosocial wellbeing, support for the patient and their caregiver, and goals of care.\n\n【132】An essential part of caring for patients with cognitive impairment and dementia is also caring for the caregiver. Caregiver burden is well described and impacts not only on the health of the caregiver but also on the patient with dementia themselves in terms of time to institutionalization, behavioral symptoms, and abuse.\n\n【133】The burden of caring for patients with dementia and its predictors.\n\n【134】Innovative care models, including but not limited to developing care plans and education and psychosocial interventions have been developed and proven successful in improving health outcomes and reducing caregiver burden.\n\n【135】Implementing dementia care models in primary care settings: The Aging Brain Care Medical Home.\n\n【136】Effectiveness of collaborative care for older adults with Alzheimer disease in primary care: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【137】The effect of a disease management intervention on quality and outcomes of dementia care: a randomized, controlled trial.\n\n【138】Effectiveness and safety of dementia care management in primary care: a randomized clinical trial.\n\n【139】A multidimensional home-based care coordination intervention for elders with memory disorders: the maximizing independence at home (MIND) pilot randomized trial.\n\n【140】Although not commonplace yet, there is an impetus to make these models more widely available.\n\n【141】Initiation of Pharmacologic Therapy\n-----------------------------------\n\n【142】Discussion of pharmacologic treatment options may be undertaken at the time of initial or subsequent cognitive assessment visits. Two main classes of medications are available for the promotion of cognitive and global functioning: acetylcholinesterase (AChEI) inhibitors and memantine. Although comprehensive review of pharmacologic options is beyond the scope of this review, clinicians must be aware of the risk, benefits, and limitations of these medication classes to partner with patients and their caregivers when making treatment decisions.\n\n【143】Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine increase the concentration of acetylcholine through the reversible inhibition of its hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase. These medications are indicated for all stages of AD and Parkinson disease dementia (rivastigmine). A recent meta-analysis of patients with AD treated with donepezil compared with placebo showed improved cognitive function as measured by a mean reduction of 2.67 (95% CI, -3.31 to 2.02) on the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale which ranges in score from 0 to 70 and a mean improvement of 1.05 (95% CI, 0.73 to 1.37) on the MMSE which ranges in score from 0 to 30. Health care use, behavioral symptoms, and quality of life were not impacted by donepezil treatment in this study.\n\n【144】Common side effects from AChEI include gastrointestinal effects as well as bradycardia, heart block, and syncope. A recent Choosing Wisely recommendation from the American Geriatrics Society suggests that patients treated with AChEI be assessed for perceived cognitive benefits and adverse gastrointestinal effects regularly, and if desired effects are not perceived, the medication should be discontinued.\n\n【145】A meta-analysis of 16 AChEI trials identified that for one patient to benefit, the number needed to treat was 7 for stabilization or better, 12 for minimal improvement or better, and 42 for marked improvement. For one additional person to have an adverse effect, the number was 12.\n\n【146】Efficacy and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.\n\n【147】Data suggest that patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and dementia due to PD may experience comparatively greater benefit than those with AD. In their 2015 meta-analysis, Wang et al\n\n【148】Efficacy and safety of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, Parkinson's disease dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies: systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.\n\n【149】found that this medication class enhanced cognitive function, reduced behavioral symptoms, and slightly improved global impression of change.\n\n【150】Memantine is the other US Food and Drug Administration–approved medication for moderate to severe AD. This medication is proposed to be neuroprotective due to the blocking of excessive N-methyl-D aspartate stimulation. Pooled data suggests small clinical benefit for memantine versus placebo when cognitive function and global clinical ratings are measured. This medication does not appear to benefit patients with mild dementia.\n\n【151】Common side effects include dizziness, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【152】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【153】Dementia remains at the forefront of global public health challenges facing modern society. As the most prevalent cause of disability in older adults, its impact is substantial and far-reaching, posing a significant financial burden on family care partners and the health care delivery system. In this clinical review, we have proposed a systematic, practical, evidence-based approach to managing the patient with new cognitive symptoms in the ambulatory care setting, outlining recommendations for clinical assessment, cognitive testing, imaging, psychosocial concerns, advance-care planning, and pharmacologic options. A critical step is making the diagnosis in a timely manner so that multidisciplinary, patient-centered, and proactive care can ensue. Primary care providers are in a unique position to partner with patients, caregivers, and community supports to deliver high-quality care and prevent crisis driven management for people with dementia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Clinical characteristics and outcome (in-hospital and post-discharge) were compared between different phenotypes.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Two WRF phenotypes were identified by latent class analysis, which we named WRF minimally responsive to diuretics (WRF-MRD) and WRF responsive to diuretics (WRF-RD). Among the population, 58 (9.5%) developed WRF-MRD and 55 (9.0%) developed WRF-RD. Patients with WRF-MRD had more comorbidities than WRF-RD. In WRF-MRD, there were an early increase in serum creatinine, a smaller amount of net fluid loss and weight loss, and a higher rate of worsening or persistent heart failure over 72 hours. In contrast, for those with WRF-RD, they had faster in-hospital net fluid loss and weight loss and a better 60-day survival after discharge even compared with patients without WRF ( _P_ \\=.004). Furthermore, baseline chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and cystatin C were independent predictors of WRF-MRD, whereas serum hemoglobin and sodium predicted WRF-RD.\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】Among hospitalized AHF patients, we identified two phenotypes of WRF with distinct response to heart failure treatment, predictors, and short-term prognosis after discharge. The results could help early differentiation of WRF phenotypes in clinical practice.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACEI ( angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor ), AHF ( acute heart failure ), ARB ( angiotensin-receptor blocker ), BUN ( blood urea nitrogen ), COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ), EF ( ejection fraction ), GFR ( glomerular filtration rate ), JVP ( jugular venous pressure ), LCA ( latent class analysis ), NT-proBNP ( N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ), SBP ( systolic blood pressure ), WRF ( worsening of renal function ), WRF-RD ( worsening of renal function responsive to diuretics ), WRF-MRD ( worsening of renal function minimally responsive to diuretics )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

However, Mr Smith has never smoked, and his family history does not indicate a genetic predisposition for hypertension, dyslipidemia, or CVD. Mr Smith is going to his primary care physician for a health assessment; he completes forms pertaining to general health information and insurance coverage and is brought to an examination room by a nurse, who measures his heart rate and BP. To this point, everything described is consistent with how health care in this setting has been conducted for decades.\n\n【3】However, in the not too distant future, the following will take place next. The nurse then asks him to complete physical activity (PA)/exercise training (ET) and dietary questionnaires, explaining that this is part of his vital signs assessment. The physician enters the room, exchanges some introductory dialogue, listens to heart sounds, and asks some standard questions pertaining to symptoms of CVD, of which there were none. The physician reviews Mr Smith’s questionnaire responses: (1) low daily PA (approximately 3000 steps per day), (2) not participating in regular ET, (3) high total fat intake (approximately 40%), and (4) high sodium intake (approximately 3000 mg/d). The conversation then quickly centers on PA, ET, and diet.\n\n【4】Guide to the assessment of physical activity: clinical and research applications: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n\n【5】Diet and lifestyle recommendations revision 2006: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association Nutrition Committee.\n\n【6】Mr Smith shares more information regarding his predominantly sedentary lifestyle; the physician is acutely aware that this pattern is a significant health concern. He then provides more detail regarding his dietary habits, which the physician also recognizes to be rather poor and disconcerting. After Mr Smith answers all questions pertaining to these core lifestyle habits, the physician is ready to provide a diagnosis and care plan: “Mr Smith, you have poor lifestyle habits, which, if not treated immediately, will likely lead to the development of one or more noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).” The physician then explains to the patient that BP, cholesterol, and blood glucose medications may be unnecessary. To treat the patient’s condition, the healthy lifestyle team will prescribe the following medical interventions: (1) strategies to increase daily PA, (2) a regular ET program, (3) guidance on a healthy diet, and (4) behavioral strategies to optimize healthy lifestyle success. This program will be individually tailored, and the patient will need to be an active participant in developing this plan. Mr Smith is then scheduled for appointments with 3 other members of the healthy lifestyle team, in this case an exercise physiologist, dietician, and behavioral counselor.\n\n【7】Mr Smith has his appointments with the exercise physiologist, dietician, and behavioral counselor within the next week, all on the same day. The exercise physiologist performs an exercise test to assess aerobic capacity, which was 20% below the predicted norm. The exercise physiologist discusses the test results followed by a conversation regarding ways to increase daily PA and how to initiate an ET program with an ultimate goal of 150 minutes or more of moderate-intensity exercise per week. Mr Smith has a smartphone, and the exercise physiologist instructs him on how to use an application that allows for tracking of daily PA and the ET program. The dietician then meets with Mr Smith in the healthy lifestyle counseling room in this clinical practice. The exercise physiologist shares the PA recommendations and ET program provided to Mr Smith with the dietician. Mr Smith is present and encouraged to engage in this dialogue. The dietician then performs an in-depth assessment of Mr Smith’s current dietary patterns. This assessment is followed by a conversation regarding strategies for a healthier diet from both a total daily calorie and food-choice perspective. The dietician and Mr Smith develop a mutually agreed on dietary program; weight loss is a desirable goal, and the diet is designed to create a negative caloric balance projected to decrease body weight by 1 to 2 lb per week. The dietician incorporates the PA/ET plan into the caloric intake projections. The mobile phone application previously downloaded during the appointment with the exercise physiologist also tracks dietary patterns, and the dietician reviews how to use this portion of the application with Mr Smith. Lastly, Mr Smith meets with a behavioral counselor, who assesses for potential barriers to successful integration of the prescribed healthy lifestyle interventions. Through this assessment, the behavioral counselor determines that Mr Smith is highly motivated to adopt these recommendations and no further interventions are needed at this time.\n\n【8】The healthy lifestyle team, composed of the physician, nurse, exercise physiologist, dietician, and behavioral counselor, discusses Mr Smith’s assessment and plan of care during their weekly meeting. All agree with the plan of care, and Mr Smith is instructed to update the healthy lifestyle team on progress and program adherence via e-mail every 2 weeks. He is encouraged to contact the healthy lifestyle team if any questions or concerns arise and is scheduled to return for a reevaluation by the team’s nurse in 3 months.\n\n【9】At Mr Smith’s reevaluation, his assessment reveals the following: BMI, 26.3; resting BP, 122/78 mm Hg; LDL-C, 110 mg/dL; HDL-C, 40 mg/dL; triglycerides, 110 mg/dL; fasting blood glucose, 95 mg/dL; hemoglobin A <sub>1c </sub> , 5%; physically active lifestyle (consistently >10,000 steps per day) and participation in a regular ET program (175 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week); and health dietary habits (25% of calories from predominantly unsaturated fats and <2000 mg/d of sodium intake). The nurse member of this team has undergone significant healthy lifestyle training and is cognizant of the excellent progress Mr Smith is making; she encourages him to continue his program. The nurse reports her findings to the healthy lifestyle team during the weekly meeting, and all concur that the intervention is effective and appropriately titrated.\n\n【10】NCDs: Why a Change in Approach to Health Care Is Needed\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】The world is well aware of the current burden of NCDs. As the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries around the world, CVD is the most disconcerting NCD.\n\n【12】The risk of developing an NCD, CVD in particular, is substantially higher in individuals with unhealthy lifestyle characteristics, including obesity, physical inactivity, poor diet, and cigarette smoking. Globally, a BMI prevalence of 25 or higher in adults is now greater than 35%; excess body mass, particularly class II/III obesity, substantially contributes to higher morbidity and mortality\n\n【13】Global, regional, and national prevalence of overweight and obesity in children and adults during 1980-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.\n\n【14】and higher health care costs (approximately $147 billion in annual health care costs currently attributable to obesity in the United States alone ). Approximately 31% of adults around the world are not meeting minimal PA requirements, with 1 in 5 adults being completely sedentary.\n\n【15】The pandemic of physical inactivity: global action for public health.\n\n【16】In 2008, physical inactivity caused approximately 5.3 million deaths globally,\n\n【17】Effect of physical inactivity on major non-communicable diseases worldwide: an analysis of burden of disease and life expectancy.\n\n【18】and being physically inactive is now the fourth leading cause of death globally\n\n【19】The pandemic of physical inactivity: global action for public health.\n\n【20】 even time spent sitting is an independent risk factor for CVD.\n\n【21】It is projected that time spent being physically inactive will continue to substantially increase, with valid concern that lack of PA will continue to threaten global health and the economy (approximately $75 billion in annual health care costs currently attributable to physical inactivity in the United States alone\n\n【22】). Dietary quality and excess caloric intake are unhealthy in many industrialized nations and significantly add to the NCD burden.\n\n【23】Smoking has decreased over time but is still a significant health problem and likewise contributes to the global NCD burden.\n\n【24】A comparative risk assessment of burden of disease and injury attributable to 67 risk factors and risk factor clusters in 21 regions, 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010.\n\n【25】It is clearly established that the incidence and prevalence of NCDs can be significantly curtailed if a healthier lifestyle is adopted globally.\n\n【26】Promoting health and wellness in the workplace: a unique opportunity to establish primary and extended secondary cardiovascular risk reduction programs.\n\n【27】2014 Consensus statement from the first Economics of Physical Inactivity Consensus (EPIC) conference (Vancouver).\n\n【28】Because of this link, NCDs are now being referred to as lifestyle-related diseases. A recent study analyzed myocardial infarction risk in a large (>20,000) male cohort in Sweden and found leading a healthy lifestyle could prevent 79% of the adverse events that occurred. The editorial associated with this study concluded, “By pursuing complementary strategies within and outside the health system, we can achieve the promise demonstrated by Åkesson and colleagues, as well as by a wealth of additional evidence, that the great majority of cardiovascular events are preventable or can be delayed until late in life by means of a healthier lifestyle.”\n\n【29】Simply stated, individuals need to exercise, improve nutritional quality and manage caloric balance, not smoke, and maintain a healthy body weight.\n\n【30】Heart disease and stroke statistics-2015 update: a report from the American Heart Association.\n\n【31】To achieve this goal, assisting individuals to lead a healthy lifestyle should and in fact must become a recognized medical intervention, standard of care, and quality indicator.\n\n【32】Enter the Healthy Lifestyle Team\n--------------------------------\n\n【33】The clinical scenario that served as the opening passage of this commentary presents a new paradigm for health care, one that encompasses a team of professionals who, collectively, have the expertise to comprehensively provide effective healthy lifestyle interventions. The clinical scenario described herein specifically identifies several integral members of the healthy lifestyle team, but additional members, not required for this specific case, are essential nonetheless. Specifically, physical and occupational therapists serve a valuable role in treating those individuals with functional deficits that result from a condition that compounds unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and impairs the ability to initiate healthy choices. Once that condition has been addressed, the physical and/or occupational therapist would transition the patient to the exercise physiologist for the long-term PA/ET program. There is also the opportunity to enhance staffing efficiency, including identifying health care professionals who may serve dual roles. For example, if properly advertised, an individual with degrees in both exercise physiology and physical therapy may be recruited for a position on a healthy lifestyle team. Moreover, although each team member has unique skills and expertise, all should have a strong cognitive and practical foundation in all facets of healthy lifestyle programming, be it through academic training, advanced certifications, continuing education courses, in-servicing, or a combination thereof. A cohesive and consistent message by each team member is essential, and this is only achieved if all team members have an understanding of the concept of a healthy lifestyle and why it is important.\n\n【34】The healthy lifestyle team must also embrace flexibility in its approach to each individual under the team’s care; it is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Some individuals already have a healthy dietary pattern but are sedentary, others require smoking cessation programming, and still others require more intensive behavioral counseling. Moreover, the intensity, or dosage, for a given healthy lifestyle intervention to be effective will vary on a continuous scale, where some individuals will be self-motivated and embrace interventions independently, whereas others will be less motivated and require more attention and interaction. Medical history and risk associated with unsupervised ET, for example, being higher in patients with heart failure, also influence the degree of interaction needed for healthy lifestyle interventions. Therefore, the healthy lifestyle team needs to be flexible in strategizing optimal interventions, specifically targeting identified unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and appropriately titrating intervention intensity and frequency of interaction, as well as forming strategic partnerships that extend the level of interaction (eg, cardiac rehabilitation, fitness clubs, community organizations, school systems, and worksite wellness programs). Moreover, the healthy lifestyle team must be vigilant in monitoring progress and adjust accordingly when progress is not being made.\n\n【35】The clinical scenario in this commentary highlights a primary prevention model. However, a clear case can be made for imbedding healthy lifestyle teams in all settings, from individuals who are not diagnosed as having a medical condition to virtually all patient populations, because the clinical benefits of a healthy lifestyle are universal. The Figure illustrates the conceptual model of the healthy lifestyle team. There is no hierarchical structure, and all members of the team are connected, signifying a shared understanding of the importance of leading a healthy lifestyle and strong communication among the group. Moreover, this model illustrates the team encapsulating the individual, providing comprehensive and holistic care with no gaps. We propose that such healthy lifestyle teams be embedded in all clinical settings.\n\n【36】Figure Conceptual model for the healthy lifestyle team. The degree of involvement needed and intervention created by each team member are tailored to the needs of the individual receiving care.\n\n【37】The Individual’s Voice Matters\n------------------------------\n\n【38】The individual in need of healthy lifestyle interventions should be an active participant in the plan of care. As an example, patient-centered medical homes place the individual receiving care in the center , supporting the patient’s needs. This model provides coordination and support for comprehensive and communicative care that is highly relevant to healthy lifestyle interventions.\n\n【39】Ultimately, a healthy lifestyle intervention will only be successful if the individual the intervention is directed toward takes ownership of the recommended changes. Having the individual involved with the care plan from the beginning is therefore a necessary component.\n\n【40】ACOs: The Birthplace of the Healthy Lifestyle Team\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】The US health care system is on the verge of enormous and needed change, which is being ushered in by the passing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n【42】This changing landscape and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act have also brought about the inception and proliferation of the accountable care organization (ACO), which “is a group of health care providers who agree to share responsibility for the quality, cost, and coordination of care for a defined population of patients.”\n\n【43】An ACO provides care to a population of covered lives; reduced costs, through lower hospital admission rates or procedures, for example, without compromising quality of care, result in higher revenue for the ACO. Some contracts specify that ACOs will pay penalties for higher health care costs. This is a notable deviation from the traditional fee-for-service model in which higher revenue is generated by a higher volume of visits and procedures. There are currently more than 400 ACOs in operation or in development, and this number will certainly increase.\n\n【44】In the NCD era, if the goal of an ACO is to provide high-quality care yet reduce expenditures, it could not hope for a better partner than the healthy lifestyle team. The fact that individuals who lead a healthier lifestyle are at substantially lower risk for developing NCDs, and thus requiring medical procedures and hospital admissions less frequently, is undeniable.\n\n【45】In fact, recognition of the importance of healthy lifestyle interventions to ACO success is already under way.\n\n【46】Moving toward implementation: the potential for accountable care organizations and private-public partnerships to advance active neighborhood design.\n\n【47】Thus, the stage has been set: the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has catalyzed a new way of thinking about health care in the United States, and ACOs have emerged as a way to deliver this new model. The focus is shifting toward preventing disease, adverse events, and associated treatment costs. This new health care model will serve as the birthplace of the healthy lifestyle team, which, in our view, is a positive event that has the potential to substantially reduce the NCD burden on a population level.\n\n【48】Conclusions\n-----------\n\n【49】We are on the verge of a new health care model in the United States, one that is focused on accountability, quality care, decreased costs, and ideally the prevention of NCDs. For this endeavor to succeed, healthy lifestyle interventions must be integrated into the health care system. The emergence of ACOs will create the infrastructure and financial model needed for healthy lifestyle teams to be created and flourish.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Eligible patients were injected with BoNTA at 225 U, 150 U, 75 U, or placebo and returned for additional masked treatments at day 90 and day 180. Patients were assessed every 30 days for 9 months. The primary efficacy end point was the mean change from baseline in the frequency of headache-free days at day 180 for the placebo nonresponder group.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】For this study, 702 patients were enrolled and randomized. The primary efficacy end point was not met. Mean improvements from baseline at day 180 of 6.0, 7.9, 7.9, and 8.0 headache-free days per month were observed in the placebo nonresponder group treated with BoNTA at 225 U, 150 U, 75 U, or placebo, respectively ( _P_ \\=.44). An a priori-defined analysis of headache frequency revealed that BoNTA at 225 U or 150 U had significantly greater least squares mean changes from baseline than placebo at day 240 (-8.4, -8.6, and -6.4, respectively; _P_ \\=.03 analysis of covariance). Only 27 of 702 patients (3.8%) withdrew from the study because of adverse events, which generally were transient and mild to moderate.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】Although the primary efficacy end point was not met, all groups responded to treatment. The 225 U and 150 U groups experienced a greater decrease in headache frequency than the placebo group at day 240. The placebo response was higher than expected. BoNTA was safe and well tolerated.

He had been residing in a memory care unit (secured assisted living facility \\[ALF\\]) for the past several months after a previous attempt to elope from a nonsecured ALF, which prompted initiation of quetiapine. His baseline functional status before hip fracture consisted of ambulating with a front-wheeled walker and requiring assistance with some activities of daily living (ADLs) including bathing, dressing, and meal setup. He was independent in transferring and grooming and was able to feed himself.\n\n【1】Review of his emergency department visit and hospital course was performed. His vital signs were normal with the exception of mild hypertension. No orthostatic vitals were obtained. On physical examination, the patient was well appearing. He had no lacerations or contusions. Cardiac and pulmonary examinations were unremarkable. An umbilical hernia was noted and the abdomen was mildly distended but nontender. Lower-extremity examination demonstrated an externally rotated and flexed left leg with intact neurovascular function. He was unable to bear weight because of pain, which was controlled by 2 doses of intravenous fentanyl.

Intracapsular (femoral neck) fractures are most common\n\n【15】Medical management in the acute hip fracture patient: a comprehensive review for the internist.\n\n【16】and carry higher risk for nonunion and avascular necrosis, as the vascular supply of the femoral head is contained within the capsule. Displaced femoral neck fractures are at highest risk for avascular necrosis and thus are typically managed with hip arthroplasty, whereas nondisplaced fractures are often treated percutaneously. This patient suffered an intertrochanteric fracture, which is an extracapsular injury. After discussion with the patient’s son (his designated health care agent), he underwent an open reduction, internal fixation. Closed reduction with internal fixation is reserved for fractures in which the bones can be realigned without surgical exposure. Hip arthroplasty (including total hip arthroplasty and bipolar hemiarthroplasty) is typically performed in patients who have displaced femoral neck fracture or are otherwise at high risk for nonhealing (such as with severe osteoporosis or pathological fractures). Nonoperative management of hip fractures is typically reserved for patients who have unacceptably high surgical risk or are nonambulatory at baseline, with limited life expectancy.\n\n【17】Medical management in the acute hip fracture patient: a comprehensive review for the internist.\n\n【18】Bed rest after hip fracture is associated with worse functional status and decreased survival compared with early ambulation.\n\n【19】On subsequent examination at a post-hospital follow-up visit, vital signs were normal. The surgical site was healing well. He noted some mild ongoing hip discomfort, mainly with ambulation, and although as-needed acetaminophen was on his medication list, he had not recently received it. He reported feeling somewhat down about recent events. In reviewing the circumstances surrounding the fall, his recollection was limited, but he denied any preceding symptoms including chest pain, syncope, dyspnea, loss of consciousness, or focal neurologic symptoms. He recalled attempting to get out of bed and ending up on the ground with pain in his left hip and calling for help. Medications at the time of the fracture and during the visit included quetiapine 12.5 mg nightly, escitalopram 10 mg daily, melatonin 3 mg nightly, metoprolol tartrate 75 mg twice daily, acetaminophen 1000 mg every 6 hours as needed for pain, vitamin D 1000 U daily, calcium carbonate 1500 mg daily (elemental calcium 600 mg), and senna-docusate 8.6 to 50 mg twice daily. He completed a short course of physical therapy after his fracture. His cataracts were last evaluated 4 years ago, at which time they were thought to be of borderline visual significance.\n\n【20】The patient’s son was called after the appointment to update him on his father’s medical condition.

This patient has multiple fall risk factors. Although his hip pain increases fall risk, a simple initial intervention, such as scheduling acetaminophen, would be more appropriate than adding an oral opioid.

A structured exercise program, which can be achieved via physical therapy or a group exercise class, is most likely to reduce his future risk of falls. Dementia is a risk factor for falls, but treatment with donepezil does not decrease this risk. Repair of first-eye cataract is associated with some reduction in subsequent risk of falls and fractures but is unlikely to provide the largest reduction of risk.

Although use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is associated with increased risk of falls, and reduction could reduce this risk, the patient has just had a major medical event and reports a low mood in the wake of this, so SSRI taper would not be advisable.\n\n【55】Fall-risk-increasing drugs: a systematic review and meta-analysis: II.

Quetiapine is prescribed for an inappropriate indication (wandering and elopement attempt) and is associated with increased risk of falls,\n\n【58】Fall-risk-increasing drugs: a systematic review and meta-analysis: II. Psychotropics.\n\n【59】which can be improved with discontinuation.\n\n【60】Evaluation of the patient’s previous imaging demonstrated osteopenia as early as 2012. Other previous fractures have included right ribs 2 through 7, left ribs 6 through 8, C7 transverse process, and T6 vertebral body, all of which were sustained in a fall from a ladder in 2018.

The patient has been on calcium and vitamin D supplementation, but this will not reduce subsequent risk of fracture to nearly the degree of bisphosphonate treatment. A fracture sustained in a ground-level fall is a fragility fracture, representative of osteoporosis. He should be treated with a bisphosphonate. A bone mineral density scan should be obtained to establish a baseline before initiation of pharmacotherapy. Exercise with weight-bearing activity is recommended to help prevent osteoporosis and is an important component of treatment, but it is not sufficient to improve bone density and reduce risk of fracture. Denosumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and prevents osteoclast maturation, and therefore bone resorption. It is an approved agent for treatment of osteoporosis, but is typically considered second-line treatment and is costly. It would be an option should the patient’s renal function worsen to the point that bisphosphonates are contraindicated (creatinine clearance <35 mL/min).\n\n【74】The patient was initiated on bisphosphonate therapy. His son was also worried that his father has seemed more tired since the fracture and has not returned to his pre-fracture level of function, ambulating only minimally and requiring assistance for essentially all ADLs, including transferring and grooming, for which he was previously independent. He wondered about his father’s future.\n\n【75】*   5.\n\n【76】    **Which of the following is the _most likely outcome_ for this patient at 1 year post-fracture?**\n\n【77】    *   a)\n\n【78】        Living independently in the community, ambulating with 4-wheeled walker, independent in ADLs\n\n【79】    *   b)\n\n【80】        Living in a nonsecured ALF, ambulating with 4-wheeled walker, independent in some ADLs including transfers, grooming, and feeding\n\n【81】    *   c)\n\n【82】        Living in a secured ALF (memory-care unit), ambulating with 4-wheeled walker, independent in some ADLs including transfers, grooming, and feeding\n\n【83】    *   d)\n\n【84】        Living in a skilled nursing facility, ambulating with a wheelchair, dependent in most ADLs but still able to feed himself independently\n\n【85】    *   e)\n\n【86】        Death\n\n【87】It is unlikely that this patient will gain functional independence after sustaining a hip fracture. He previously moved to a secured ALF due to an elopement attempt. Return to a nonsecured environment is unlikely. His ADL function has worsened since his hip fracture, and he now requires assistance with transfers and grooming.

At that appointment, he was ambulating with a 4-wheeled walker and requiring 24-hour-a-day supervision. At subsequent follow-up one year post-fracture, the patient was residing in a skilled nursing facility, ambulating with a wheelchair, and largely ADL-dependent.\n\n【94】Discussion\n----------\n\n【95】Falls are a common and costly geriatric syndrome associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. As the population continues to age, the incidence of falls will likely increase. When a fall occurs, it is important to assess factors that contributed to the fall and perform interventions that will decrease the risk of future falls such as treatment of uncontrolled lower extremity pain, structured exercise incorporating balance exercises and lower-extremity strength training, use of an appropriate gait aid, and deprescribing of fall-risk–increasing medications. In the case of a fracture resulting from a fall, it is crucial to assess the bone health of the patient. Many fractures (including hip) sustained in a ground-level fall represent fragility fractures, diagnostic of osteoporosis. A discussion of osteoporosis treatment options and risks/benefits is therefore essential. The choice of agent will depend upon several factors including cost, renal function, and associated side effects. Hip fractures confer significant risk for mortality and increased functional dependence. Advance care planning, including honest discussion about prognosis and iterative review of patient goals, is of paramount importance so that medical care can be tailored appropriately, both in the immediate post-fracture period and longer term.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

For contact tracing, we assumed an advanced automated contact tracing (AACT) application that sends alerts to individuals advising self-isolation based on individual exposure profile. Model parameters included percentage population ordered to shelter-in-place, adoption rate of AACT, and percentage individuals who appropriately follow recommendations. Under influence of these variables, the number of individuals infected, exposed, and isolated were estimated.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Without any intervention, a high rate of infection (>10 million) with early peak is predicted. Shelter-in-place results in rapid decline in infection rate at the expense of impacting a large population segment. The AACT model achieves reduction in infected and exposed individuals similar to shelter-in-place without impacting a large number of individuals. For example, a 50% AACT adoption rate mimics a shelter-in-place order for 40% of the population and results in a greater than 90% decrease in peak number of infections. However, as compared to shelter-in-place, with AACT significantly fewer individuals would be isolated.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Wide adoption of digital contact tracing can mitigate infection spread similar to universal shelter-in-place, but with considerably fewer individuals isolated.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AACT ( advanced automated contact tracing ), CoV ( coronavirus ), SARS ( severe acute respiratory syndrome )\n\n【11】In the absence of a vaccine or cure, non-pharmacological interventions are critical to reducing spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome – coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This is primarily accomplished through containment and isolation, such as the universal shelter-in-place order used in many cities and states across the United States.\n\n【12】The need for such orders is due to the exponential growth of cases that occur during an outbreak, which generally needs to be countered by a fast, coordinated, and widespread response. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 during asymptomatic infectious periods further complicates this response.\n\n【13】Presumed asymptomatic carrier transmission of COVID-19.\n\n【14】Asymptomatic infected individuals may not see the need to self-isolate, and it is difficult for public health infrastructure to identify such cases and enforce isolation during this period.\n\n【15】Substantial undocumented infection facilitates the rapid dissemination of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2).\n\n【16】Contact tracing has the potential to limit spread of infectious diseases. This has been proven in epidemics such as SARS, bird flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and others.\n\n【17】Traditional contact tracing suffers from the problem of scalability as they are based on phone interviews and record keeping. On the other hand, current technologies permit constant tracking of individuals and locations via mobile phones, global positioning systems, WiFi, and Bluetooth. A system that leverages these technologies to track and record movement of individuals, and monitor proximity to others for potential exposure, can help overcome difficulties posed by manual contact tracing. Many app-based systems — for example, Private Kit: SafePaths,\n\n【18】Covid Symptom Tracker, and the Apple/Google collaborative contact tracing venture\n\n【19】— are currently being tested. Such advanced automated contact tracing (AACT) systems, which could infer exposure risk and propagate warnings to people at risk, may help curb disease spread by facilitating targeted self-isolation rather than universal mandates such as shelter-in-place.\n\n【20】In this paper, we compare universal shelter-in-place with targeted self-isolation envisioned in AACT. With available data pertaining to SARS-CoV-2 we model strategies for the United States and estimate societal burden. Our work builds on a prior model.\n\n【21】Materials and source code are available at Github.\n\n【22】Methods\n-------\n\n【23】Our disease model is based on the susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered (SEIR) model assuming a constant susceptible population.\n\n【24】Using these data, two separate models were created — AACT and universal shelter-in-place. In both, computational methods were used to determine impact in terms of infected individuals and proportion of population impacted by isolation/quarantine orders. Modeling and study was performed based on data regarding the pandemic published between February 1, 2020, and May 25, 2020.\n\n【25】### Initial Variables\n\n【26】For the model, we assumed the following: T <sub>inc </sub> \\= incubation period (∼5.1 days),\n\n【27】The incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application.\n\n【28】T <sub>lat </sub> \\= latency period before development of symptoms (∼ 11.5 days),\n\n【29】The incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application.\n\n【30】and basic R <sub>0 </sub> \\= 3.02.\n\n【31】Preliminary death rate μ = 0.057 (with case fatality ratio of 1.5018%, as estimated by recent global data).\n\n【32】Further details are summarized in Supplemental Material .\n\n【33】Several variables were considered in model development and summarized in Figure 1 . Compartments included: S (susceptible individuals), E (exposed to infection, unclear symptomatic conditions, and potentially infectious), I (infected, confirmed symptomatic, and infectious), R (Recovered, immune from further infection), and D (death due to SARS-CoV-2). In AACT, an additional compartment Sq (traced contacts who are exposed and under self-isolation) was used whereas for shelter-in-place, the compartment Q (individuals isolated through universal enforcement measures) was used. The basic difference between the models is that isolation/quarantine is based solely on exposure history in AACT, whereas isolation orders apply to the entire population in universal shelter-in-place.\n\n【34】Figure 1 Overview of model transitions used to simulate advanced automated contact tracing based targeted isolation (left) and universal shelter-in-place (right).\n\n【35】### Advanced, Automated Contact Tracing Model\n\n【36】We assumed that through the AACT app , it is possible to inform exposed (asymptomatic/noninfected) individuals of exposure risk. Once warned, they may self-isolate and prevent second-order spreading. Therefore, self-isolated contacts will depend on penetrance _p_ of the AACT app in infected and exposed populations. The equations and details used to build the model are summarized in the Supplemental Material . Two key elements that fall into AACT include percentage of individuals adopting (ie, downloading) the app, and percentage who self-isolate in response to an exposure alert. Our model assumes that for the fraction of individuals who heed the warning, there is no transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from exposed individuals to other susceptible individuals.\n\n【37】### Universal Shelter-in-Place Model\n\n【38】Measures that limit public gatherings or mandate full lockdown uniformly impact the susceptible population. They are successful in isolating a fraction of the population, with the unquarantined transitioning through exposure, infection, recovery, or death. Such measures, depending on duration of enforcement (assumed to be constant in our model), are independent of percentage of infected population or percentage exposed. The key variable considered is percentage of population that is under shelter-in-place orders. For example, if 100% of the population (including essential personnel) is ordered to stay at home, nobody will be allowed outside and disease transmission will be halted. In real life, percentages far below 100% would be expected. In the current model, we assume shelter-in-place measures will be released after 50 days .\n\n【39】### Software and Modeling\n\n【40】All models were created using R (version 3.6.1, 2019), and Tidyverse (2017) and Stats packages . All graphs were created using R.\n\n【41】Results\n-------\n\n【42】Both models agree with each other when adoption of digital contact tracing and universal shelter-in-place mandate are close to zero (ie, p=0 and g=0, where p is adoption rate of AACT and g is percentage population ordered to shelter-in-place) . Without any control measures, our models suggest a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection .\n\n【43】Figure 2 Comparison of impact of advanced automated contact tracing (left) and shelter-in-place (right) in terms of number infected (A vs B), exposed (C vs D), and size of impacted population (E vs F).

For example, with 20% adoption and 100% compliance, AACT would lower peak number of infected individuals by 49% and cumulative deaths by 23%. Enforcing shelter-in-place measures for 30% of the population would almost completely halt SARS-CoV-2 spread. However, such a measure would quarantine, at peak, more than 71 million people as opposed to isolating approximately 12 million in AACT to achieve similar reduction. As can be seen in Figures 2 E and 2 F, the main difference between the models is in societal burden imposed in terms of number of individuals expected to be quarantined or isolated.\n\n【48】Both adoption of AACT (ie, how many people downloaded the application), and percentage of people who heed the advice of the application (ie, self-isolate when a warning is issued) are critical to success of digital contact tracing. For example, if 100% of users respond to an exposure alert by self-isolating, lower adoption rates would be sufficient; conversely, lower response rates to alerts require a higher adoption rate in the general population. Figure 3 A and the Supplemental Video  summarize this tradeoff for different adoption rates and user response rates over the course of the pandemic. Figure 3 B offers a graphic of the percentage of the population impacted at peak as a function of the application adoption rate and user response rate.\n\n【49】Figure 3 Variation in number of impacted individuals over time as a function of (A) percent adoption of AACT and (B) percentage who self-isolate in response to alerts.

Past experience with Spanish flu, SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome shows that interventions that limit contact, increase social distance, and reduce exposure risk are essential to “flattening the curve.” Governments around the world have instituted isolation measures such as shelter-in-place or stay-at-home to achieve these goals.\n\n【53】However, universal isolation measures disrupt the fabric of society by hindering social interactions, limiting support for people with disabilities, and exacerbating mental health challenges. On the economic front, such measures decrease productivity, disrupt supply chains, and unsettle financial markets. In fact, recent invocation of “aegrescit medendo'' in the US political discourse refers to the pain and suffering associated with these measures.\n\n【54】Contact tracing is routinely used for controlling infectious diseases.\n\n【55】Stochastic mathematical models, and past experience in the swine flu pandemic of 2009 and Ebola outbreak of 2014, have shown contact tracing can reduce R <sub>0 </sub> by as much as 90%.\n\n【56】Preliminary studies have shown that, accounting for heterogeneity of social interactions, it may be sufficient to trace 36 contacts per infected person to reduce R <sub>0 </sub> for SARS-CoV-2 from 3.11 to 0.21.\n\n【57】Contact tracing is not novel, but the exponential nature of the ever-enlarging tree of exposures makes conventional manual contact tracing cumbersome.\n\n【58】Especially in later stages of an epidemic, an automated or semi-automated solution is required to be scalable — a solution that we have dubbed AACT. In this paper we compared universal containment against AACT, a version of automated contact tracing that is able to recursively enumerate all persons who came into contact with an infected person. AACT envisions a system that can instantaneously trace individuals in the exposure network of an index case, and issue warnings to everyone in this network.\n\n【59】AACT coupled with targeted self-isolation has several advantages over universal containment measures. The obvious advantage is society can still function with a select number of individuals in isolation. This approach also attempts to halt disease spread at the earliest time point after identification of infected individuals. AACT enables first- or second-order exposures to isolate and limit further disease spread even when not showing symptoms. Therefore, it enables remedies that may work in the pre-symptomatic stage. From the point of view of public health officials, AACT may provide an early estimate of exposure risk and disease burden that the health care system will face. Such information can be used to increase readiness. It may also facilitate patient surveillance and streamline flow and distribution through the health care system. Finally, with the envisioned pandemic control system, AACT and targeted isolation can be quickly deployed at first signs of an outbreak with the goal of limiting disease spread without resorting to measures such as shelter-in-place.\n\n【60】Our models show that with targeted digital contact tracing it is feasible to reduce disease spread while impacting fewer individuals. Success of AACT hinges not only on user adoption, but also on users’ willingness to abide by recommendations. If individuals do not universally respond to alerts by self-isolating, impact of AACT on disease spread would be minimal. Similarly, at lower adoption rates, exposures could not be tracked, thus undercutting benefits. AACT would be most successful with universal adoption and universal response. Nonetheless, we have shown even at modest adoption and response rates, it is feasible to significantly mitigate disease spread while limiting number of individuals isolated.\n\n【61】In a real-world context, several countries have started introducing AACT to help reopen societies and mitigate continued disease spread. Data from Singapore suggested that digital contact tracing carries higher sensitivity and specificity for identifying contacts than traditional approaches.\n\n【62】Use of a real-time locating system for contact tracing of health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic at an infectious disease center in Singapore: validation study.\n\n【63】The data on the efficacy of these measures, however, is limited and requires rigorous analysis before conclusions from models can be made. Thus, recommendations have been proposed to achieve this and hopefully will result in more rigorous analysis.\n\n【64】The need for real-world context is especially important given that several factors, including technological literacy, infrastructure, governmental regulations, user adoption based on culture, and factors such as regional population flow may impact efficacy. For example, likelihood of broad user adoption and compliance would likely be lower in the absence of governmental support, depending on the population. Furthermore, populations with high frequency of exchange with surrounding countries, states, or regions in which AACT is not used may overcome any value of AACT. Additionally, without appropriate infrastructure (wireless systems to transmit data, centralized databases that can aggregate data, etc), the viability of AACT would be limited.\n\n【65】### Study Limitations\n\n【66】There are several limitations to our models. First, we initialized our models with fixed parameters; in reality, parameters have been dynamic and evolved as the pandemic progressed. However, the intent of this paper was to compare strategies for mitigating disease spread assuming a common disease model. It is fair to assume comparative outcome of AACT and universal stay-at-home would be similar regardless of their initialization. Second, success of AACT may depend on type of technology used. For example, global positioning systems have lower location accuracy than Bluetooth or WiFi. Thus, systems that predict exposure based on proximity between an infected individual and an app user would be more accurate (and thus impact fewer people) when technology has higher location accuracy. Also, we assumed adoption of AACT is uniformly distributed throughout the population. Diffuse uptake evenly throughout a society would be expected to have more benefit than uptake in dense pockets. Finally, our modeling does not account for transmission from exposed individuals to other susceptible individuals (eg, household members) between the time of exposure and the time they self-quarantine. Such third-order exposures were not accounted for by the model and thus skew the data in favor of AACT. However, with comprehensive use, near real-time results, and application of self-quarantine rules to household exposures, such deviations could be reduced.\n\n【67】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【68】Contact tracing can mitigate disease spread through a curated approach of identifying and isolating exposed individuals, as opposed to shelter-in-place orders. Applications that can be implemented through available smart phones and other devices may offer an opportunity to facilitate contact tracing and alert individuals to self-isolate after exposure. These efforts afford the ability to mitigate disease spread in similar rates to universal shelter-in-place when adopted at sufficient rates, assuming a high percentage of users respond to exposure alerts issued by the system.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Arnold—“St. Helena's Greatest Friend”\nWilberforce John James Arnold was born in Belfast, Ireland, in 1867, the eldest son of a surgeon. He attended Methodist College and Queen's College (now Queen's University) in Belfast and qualified for medicine and surgery in 1894. His health was always somewhat frail, and in an attempt to strengthen his constitution, he spent a year away from his medical studies at sea on a clipper ship. His first medical assignment after qualification was assistant surgeon at a small hospital and a colliery in a coal district in Wales. In 1900, he moved to the isolated South Atlantic island of St. Helena, a small British colonial outpost most famous as the site of Napoleon's final, fatal exile. Arnold remained on St. Helena until his death, except for a brief residence in England in 1912 to obtain a public health diploma from the University of Oxford and a more lengthy overseas absence from 1914 to 1920—a period that included World War I (1914-1918) service with General Edmund Allenby (1861-1936) in Palestine, followed by a prolonged convalescence from malaria.\n\n【1】In 1903, Arnold became the Colonial Surgeon of St. Helena, a poorly paid position where overwork was his constant companion, especially because the island was plagued by multiple epidemics during his tenure, including influenza, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and whooping cough. He was also a Justice of the Peace and involved in the affairs of the colonial government, serving temporarily as Acting Governor of the island several times after the death or departure of one of the regular governors. His publication list includes only a single case report, but his skills and lasting legacy were in the area of public health. During his service as St. Helena's surgeon, he modernized the island's sewer and water systems, campaigned against rats, taught the police how to administer first aid, introduced vaccination programs, and greatly improved the nutrition and health education of the islanders. No building could be built on the island without his explicit approval after a careful review of the structure's possible health effects. Arnold's tireless efforts paid off: the infant mortality rate and overall death rate on the island decreased dramatically between the commencement of his service in 1903 and his death 2 decades later.\n\n【2】In January 1925, with his health failing, Arnold was awarded a CMG (Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George) in the New Year's Honours, but he died later that same month of a cerebral hemorrhage. Tributes from patients published just after his death stated that he was a trusted and well-loved practitioner who frequently waived fees for his poorer patients and sometimes gave needy villagers money to help them through especially difficult times. After his death, a large granite memorial was erected by public subscription in the Grand Parade (the main plaza) of Jamestown, St. Helena's only town; the inscription describes Dr Arnold as “the greatest friend St. Helena ever had.”\n\n【3】A stamp honoring Arnold was issued by St. Helena as part of the Quincentenary Celebrations in 2002, commemorating the discovery of the uninhabited island by Portugese explorers in 1502.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Data sources were MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases, proceedings of the 3rd International Consultation on Incontinence, and reference lists of retrieved clinical trials and review articles. Trials were eligible if they consisted of nursing home or long-term institutionalized residents with UI. Eligible trials compared interventions for improving UI with controls, including comparisons of UI outcomes and/or adverse events between randomized groups.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Fourteen unique clinical trials, consisting of 1161 patients, met inclusion criteria. Treatments included antimuscarinic medications, oral estrogen plus progesterone, and behavioral interventions (eg, prompted voiding). Compared with usual care, prompted voiding alone or prompted voiding plus exercise reduced daytime incontinence and increased appropriate toileting. Efficacy outcomes indicated that neither prompted voiding plus exercise nor prompted voiding plus oral estrogen and progesterone was superior to prompted voiding alone for incontinence management. Prompted voiding plus oxybutynin slightly reduced incontinence compared with prompted voiding plus placebo.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】In nursing home residents with UI, prompted voiding alone and prompted voiding with exercise were associated with modest short-term improvement in daytime UI. Results do not clearly support an independent effect of exercise in improving UI. Oxybutynin may provide small additional benefit when used with prompted voiding. There appears to be no role for oral estrogen in UI treatment. Long-term clinical trials of prompted voiding alone, prompted voiding with exercise, and antimuscarinic medications should be conducted with targeted nursing home residents who have UI. These trials should include measures of UI, patient quality of life, and cost outcomes.\n\n【8】FIT ( functional incidental training ), MMSE ( Mini-Mental State Examination ), UI ( urinary incontinenc )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Consent forms were obtained in October 2020. Using Microsoft Word tools, we analyzed the readability (ie, the ease of reading) of written consent forms and informational documents from phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in the United States from the following manufacturers: AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Owing to low readability and several format factors, this study determined that none of the consent forms or informational documents from the recent phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials conducted in the United States met readability standards at the recommended 7th grade readability level for the average vaccine research volunteer in any readability category. The average English-speaking vaccine trial volunteer would have great difficulty comprehending the information provided in the consent forms and informational documents. To ensure that study subjects receive and fully comprehend information regarding a clinical study and can provide reliable consent, greater attention should be given to the development and use of simplified consent forms, multimedia formatting, personal discussion, and comprehension assessments.\n\n【7】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【8】CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ), CFR ( Code of Federal Regulations ), COVID-19 ( Coronavirus Disease 2019 ), DHHS ( Department of Health and Human Services ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), OHRP ( Office of Human Research Protection )\n\n【9】The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a novel respiratory illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is responsible for the current global pandemic.\n\n【10】In response, pharmaceutical companies implemented phase 3 clinical trials in the United States and other countries to assess the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccine candidates. Before enrollment in these vaccine trials, informational documents and consent forms are provided to potential study subjects. These documents provide subjects with basic study information, including necessary precautions, privacy measures, and potential vaccine benefits, risks, and side effects. By providing their signatures on the consent forms, study subjects acknowledge that they understand the potential consequences of participating in the study and are willing to accept the risks associated with the study. In this paper, we analyze the readability of these informational documents and consent forms.\n\n【11】During the informed consent process, United States law requires volunteer study subjects to be informed and educated about the risks, benefits, and alternatives of the experimental medical intervention and procedures.\n\n【12】For informed consent to be valid, the patient or study volunteer must adequately understand the risks of participating in the clinical trial and voluntarily provide consent.\n\n【13】In fact, any intervention without clear patient consent could be considered assault.\n\n【14】Several factors may impede informed consent, including the subject’s education level, inadequate or complicated consent information, or ineffective communication between subjects and research professionals. Because study information packets and consent forms are the primary method by which study information and procedures are communicated regarding the clinical trial, the readability and comprehension of these materials are critical. If a study volunteer is unable to read and comprehend the information provided in the consent form, the provision of consent is misguided and invalid. Thus, informed consent documents must be written in a manner that accommodates trial participants in regard to their reading ability and comprehension.\n\n【15】Assessing consent form readability is a critical step toward ensuring that the text is at an appropriate level for readers who have varying proficiency.\n\n【16】Data collected by the National Work Group on Literacy and Health indicate that approximately a quarter of US citizens have rudimentary reading skills and are likely unable to read and understand even medication instructions, a bus schedule, or directions on cleaning products.\n\n【17】The average UK citizen reads at a lower level than the average US citizen;\n\n【18】however, this does not mean that these people should be excluded from clinical trial research. For clinical research conducted in the United States, the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP), Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandate the use of consent forms as described in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).\n\n【19】According to a study conducted by the National Adult Literacy Agency, consent materials should have readability levels at the 7th grade, which is the average reading grade level for adults in the United States.\n\n【20】Other consent form factors, such as font size, document layout, charts, pictures, vocabulary, and word length, can also greatly affect readability.\n\n【21】Many experts recommend using plain vocabulary, culture- and gender-neutral wording, short sentences, active voice, bulleted lists, and present tense in documents intended for the public.\n\n【22】The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the readability of the consent forms and informational documents from multiple phase 3 COVID-19 clinical vaccine trials being conducted in the United States to determine if they meet the guidelines for adequate public readability.\n\n【23】Methods\n-------\n\n【24】We acquired electronic consent forms and informational documents from AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, Novavax, and Pfizer for the phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trials recently conducted in the United States. All 5 companies provided an informed consent document written for adult study subjects. Two companies also provided informational documents given to study subjects, and 1 company provided a consent and assent form for their vaccine study involving adolescents.\n\n【25】Using the readability tools available in Microsoft Word, we evaluated formatting metrics and readability statistics in each consent form and informational document. Two authors independently analyzed formatting and readability to reduce bias. Assent form F was used in a vaccine trial on adolescents. Because of this, it has significantly higher (ie, easier) readability scores in all of the categories analyzed, and therefore we did not include the readability scores for the adolescent assent form in our report outlining the mean metrics of the adult consent forms.\n\n【26】We used 3 readability formulas to determine the difficulty of a text. The Flesch Reading Ease score is a scale that predicts reading ease on a scale from 1 to 100, with 70 being an appropriate level for the average reader in the United States.\n\n【27】Higher scores indicate easier readability. This formula, which is the most tested and reliable readability formula, is widely used .\n\n【28】Table 1 Flesch Reading Ease Score Comparison\n\n| Style | Flesch Reading Ease score | Average sentence length in words | Average number of syllables per 100 words | Type of magazine | Estimated school grade completed | Estimated percent of US adults |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Very easy | 90-100 | 8 or less | 123 or less | Comics | 4th grade | 93 |\n| Easy | 80-90 | 11 | 131 | Pulp fiction | 5th grade | 91 |\n| Fairly easy | 70-80 | 14 | 139 | Slick fiction | 6th grade | 88 |\n| Standard | 60-70 | 17 | 147 | Digests | 7th or 8th grade | 83 |\n| Fairly difficult | 50-60 | 21 | 155 | Quality | Some high school | 54 |\n| Difficult | 30-50 | 25 | 167 | Academic | High school to college | 33 |\n| Very difficult | 0-30 | 29 or more | 192 or more | Scientific | College | 4.5 |\n\n【30】The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score is a readability score developed by the US Navy. It predicts the reading ease of a passage on a scale from 1 to 12, which indicates the education grade level necessary to read the passage.\n\n【31】A 7th grade level is recommended for the average reader in the United States.\n\n【32】Although the Flesch Reading Ease score and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score are both based on word length and sentence length, they have different weighting factors. We recognize a difference in grade level assessment between the mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and mean Gunning Fog Index. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level truncates readability at the 12th grade level and may, in fact, underestimate the actual reading level required for complex text.\n\n【33】Table 1 compares the Flesch Reading Ease score with the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score.\n\n【34】Finally, The Gunning Fog index, which is similar to the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, is a readability test that scores text from 1 to 20. Scores are based on the number of complex words per sentence in a ~100 word passage. A complete score is obtained by averaging the Gunning Fog index score for three random 100 word passages throughout the consent forms. Texts requiring near-universal understanding generally require an index of 7 .\n\n【35】Table 2 Gunning Fog Index Grade Comparison\n\n| Gunning Fog index | Reading level by grade |\n| --- | --- |\n| 17 | College graduate |\n| 16 | College senior |\n| 15 | College junior |\n| 14 | College sophomore |\n| 13 | College freshman |\n| 12 | High school senior |\n| 11 | High school junior |\n| 10 | High school sophomore |\n| 9 | High school freshman |\n| 8 | 8th grade |\n| 7 | 7th grade |\n| 6 | 6th grade |\n\n【37】Results\n-------\n\n【38】We obtained and reviewed 2 informational documents and 7 consent forms, including the adolescent assent and adult consent forms for an adolescent study, used in the 5 phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials conducted in the United States. To provide confidentiality to the pharmaceutical companies, each consent form was randomly assigned a letter (A to G). Informational documents were randomly assigned either Y or Z. No significant difference in any scoring metric was detected by the 2 independent persons who scored readability and formatting metrics.\n\n【39】The lengths of the 7 consent forms and 2 informational documents ranged from 7 to 36 pages, with a mean of 24.6 pages. The number of words (including headers) ranged from 1839 to 10,337, with a mean of 8619.8 words. Words per page ranged from 240.4 to 462.2 (mean 350.2), and words per paragraph ranged from 16.1 to 100.4 (mean 38.8). Font size ranged from 10 to 12 points. Consent form C used font size 10; consent form A used font size 11; and consent forms B, D, E, F, and G used font size 12 (mean 11.4). Consent forms A, B, C, and Y used Times New Roman font, whereas consent forms D, E, F, G, and Z used Arial or Calibri fonts. The mean word length ranged from 4.3 to 5 characters (mean 4.8). Mean sentence length ranged from 16.9 to 20.4 words (mean 19.1) .\n\n【40】Table 3 Phase 3 COVID-19 Vaccine Trial Document Statistics\n\n|  | Total pages | Total paragraphs | Total words | Words/page | Words/paragraph | Font style | Font size | Word length (characters) | Sentence Length (Words) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Adult Consent Forms |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| A | 24 | 608 | 9789 | 407.9 | 16.1 | Times new roman (TNR) | 11 | 4.7 | 16.9 |\n| B | 27 | 348 | 9575 | 354.6 | 27.5 | TNR | 12 | 4.8 | 19.6 |\n| C | 22 | 502 | 10,168 | 462.2 | 20.3 | TNR | 10 | 4.8 | 19 |\n| D | 36 | 421 | 9736 | 270.4 | 23.1 | Arial | 12 | 4.8 | 20.4 |\n| E | 30 | 103 | 10,337 | 344.6 | 100.4 | Arial | 12 | 4.7 | 17.5 |\n| G | 31 | 139 | 9957 | 321.2 | 71.6 | Arial | 12 | 4.6 | 18.5 |\n| Adult Informational documents |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Y | 7 | 100 | 1839 | 262.7 | 18.4 | TNR | 10 | 5 | 19.2 |\n| Z | 29 | 230 | 7557 | 260.6 | 32.9 | Calibri | 12 | 4.7 | 21.7 |\n| Mean | 24.63 | 306.38 | 8619.75 | 350.18 | 38.78 | TNR | 11.38 | 4.76 | 19.1 |\n| Adolescent assent form |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| F | 8 | 107 | 2345 | 293.1 | 21.9 | Arial | 12 | 4.3 | 17.7 |\n| Recommended levels | <15 | None | None | None | None | Arial/Calibri | 14 | None | 15 |\n\n【42】The percent of passive sentences ranged from 0% to 42.1% (mean 33%).

We found that none of the consent forms or informational documents had readability levels that met recommended standards for average English-speaking vaccine volunteers in any category. In addition, very few met the recommended criteria in page number, sentence length, font style, and percentage of passive-voice sentences. Although assent form F for the adolescent study did not reach desired readability metrics, it scored notably better in readability metrics, demonstrating that improved readability is possible.\n\n【47】Study subjects are less likely to fully comprehend informational documents that are excessively detailed and lengthy.\n\n【48】Thus, the number of pages in informational materials should be fewer than 15.\n\n【49】The informed consent documents we reviewed ranged from 8 to 36 pages (mean 24.6). This average exceeds the recommended number of 15 by nearly 10 pages.\n\n【50】High word density can also lead to incomprehensibility because it raises the difficulty level of a text. Too many words in a sentence or on a page can hinder or prevent comprehension of key content. For this reason, it is recommended that sentences be between 12 and 17 words.\n\n【51】The mean sentence length ranged from 16.9 to 20.4 words (mean 19.1), several words more than the recommended 12 to 17 word limit.\n\n【52】Other factors, such as font style and size, can also play a role in assessing the readability of a text. Sans serif fonts, such as Arial or Calibri, are preferred over serif fonts such as Times New Roman. In addition to this, larger size fonts, especially size 14, are easier to read than smaller fonts.\n\n【53】The font size in all of the consent forms and readability documents was too small; however, some did use appropriate font style (eg, Arial). Although studies demonstrate that 14 point font is preferred, all the consent forms and informational documents in this study varied between 10 and 12 point font. Documents D, E, F, G, and Z used the favorable sans serif (eg, Arial or Calibri) fonts, whereas documents A, B, C, and Y used serif (Times New Roman) font.\n\n【54】A high percentage of passive-voice sentences, or sentences in which the subject receives the action of the verb, also has a negative impact on readability.\n\n【55】The percentage of passive-voice sentences in the consent forms ranged from 0% to 42.1% (mean 33%). Only consent form G had 0% sentences in passive voice. Assent form F was marginally successful in this category, with only 18.3% written in passive voice.\n\n【56】It is critical that research subjects are able to comprehend informed consent material. Many studies indicate that research volunteers often do not understand critical aspects of the research in which they are participating, suggesting that “informed” consent is imperfectly realized.\n\n【57】Comprehension and informed consent: assessing the effect of a short consent form.\n\n【58】This is largely due to the increasing length and complexity of consent forms. Providing too much information can have similar consequences to not providing enough information. Consequently, the informed consent process may not accomplish the goal of adequately informing prospective participants about the nature of a study and its potential risks and benefits. As almost half of American adults read at or below the 8th grade level, this study demonstrates that the consent form information used in the phase 3 clinical trials in the United States is too difficult to ensure comprehension for the majority of adult readers. Assessing the study participants’ knowledge about the study at the end of the consent process could help improve their consent form comprehension. If subjects fail to answer questions critical to indicating an understanding of the study correctly, it would indicate a lack of understanding the consent documents. Engaging with study subjects may also help investigators learn about limitations of their consent forms.\n\n【59】Aside from readability that is too complex and text that is too long, the consent forms analyzed in this study also lacked instructional graphics and multimedia including pictures, charts, videos, or slideshows, which increase both appeal and comprehension levels.\n\n【60】Verbal discussion between volunteers and study educators also appears to be an effective way of improving research participants’ understanding.\n\n【61】Further research is necessary to determine the most effective methods to educate patients on study information.\n\n【62】Consent form readability could be significantly improved by using standard readability formulas, applying rewriting techniques, and being aware of subjects' reading comprehension levels.\n\n【63】The biopharmaceutical industry, FDA, National Cancer Institute, and National Institutes of Health often advise developing consent forms appropriate for a 6th to 8th grade reading level.\n\n【64】Using readability formulas such as the Flesch Reading Ease Score, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and the Gunning Fog Index would enable preanalysis of readability and allow development of reliable and understandable consent forms. As many factors influence text readability, using several of these formulas as well as other physical formatting aspects of the text can assist in providing highly readable consent forms.\n\n【65】### Limitations\n\n【66】The limitations of our study include analyzing readability statistics primarily based on the population of the United States; therefore, these reading scores only pertain to analysis of such documents written in the English language. Studies in other nations may have different population education or language readability statistics. This study does not consider that readability scores may be further affected based on specific institutional review board specifications in a given region or country. This study also does not evaluate whether some people desire more information than presented in the consent forms. Studies show that although some people believe that vaccine pamphlets provide too much information, others may not think the information received is adequate, and at least 1 study has evaluated provision of vaccine related material based on the subject choosing the grade level complexity they prefer.\n\n【67】The strengths of our study include comparing consent forms for all 5 phase 3 COVID-19 vaccines conducted in the United States.\n\n【68】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【69】The results of our study indicate that an appreciable percent of the study participants involved are likely to have not understood the consent forms used in phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trials in the United States. This reinforces the need to address—and improve—readability of informed consent forms and informational documents. Further, the role of readability when enrolling the elderly, illiterate, or disadvantaged minority communities in clinical trials who may have lower reading levels, adds further significance to this issue. Additional strategies, such as multimedia formatting, personal discussion, and comprehension assessments to improve the public understanding of consent forms in clinical trials, are also warranted. We conclude that informational documents and consent forms for the current phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine studies are not written in a way that promotes participant comprehension and understanding. Given the vital role these trials have in combating the COVID-19 pandemic, significant work needs to be done to improve the readability and comprehension of informed consent documents.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

This article describes the strengths and weaknesses of single items and summated scores (from multiple items) as QOL measures. We also address the use of single global measures vs multiple subindices as measures of QOL. The primary themes that recur throughout this article are the relationships between well-defined research objectives, the research setting, and the choice single item vs summated scores to measure QOL. The conceptual framework of the study, the conceptual fit with the measure, and the purpose of the assessment should all be considered when choosing a measure of QOL. No “gold standard” QOL measure can be recommended because no “one size fits all.” Single items have the advantage of simplicity at the cost of detail. Multiple-item indices have the advantage of providing a complete profile of QOL component constructs at the cost of increased burden and of asking potentially irrelevant questions. The 2 types of indices are not mutually exclusive and can be used together in a single research study or in the clinical setting.\n\n【1】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【2】COOP/WONCA ( Primary Care Cooperative Information Project/World Organization of National Colleges, Academies, and Academic Associations of General Practitioners/Family Physicians ), EORTC QLQ-C30 ( European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire core 30 items ), FLIC ( Functional Living Index- Cancer ), QOL ( quality of life ), SF-36 ( 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured at the femoral neck or lumbar spine; T scores represent the number of SDs below the mean for young healthy women. One risk index was calculated from age and weight; the other risk indices included up to 4 additional variables obtained by questionnaire. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity for identifying women with BMD T scores of -2.5 or less or -2.0 or less in the US clinic sample and created 3 risk categories, using each of the 4 indices.\n\n【3】### Results\n\n【4】Data were available for 1102 women from the US clinic sample, 3374 women in the Rotterdam Study, 23,833 women screened for a clinical trial of alendronate, and 4204 women from general practice centers in the Netherlands. Specificity for identifying BMD T scores of -2.5 or less ranged from 37% to 58% (depending on risk index) when sensitivity was approximately 90%. The prevalence of osteoporosis (defined as T scores ≤-2.5) differed widely across the 3 risk categories, ranging from 2% to 4% for the low-risk category to 47% to 61% for the high-risk category in the US clinic sample. For spine BMD in the US clinic sample, the prevalence of T scores of -2.5 or less ranged from 7% (low risk) to 38% (high risk). The large differences in prevalence across risk categories were consistent across the other 3 samples of postmenopausal women in the United States and the Netherlands for all 4 risk indices.\n\n【5】### Conclusions\n\n【6】We recommend measuring BMD in women who are classified as having an increased risk of osteoporosis by using any of these risk indices because all 4 indices appear to predict low bone mass equally well.

The fundamental element of our response to all of the questions raised by Dr Farag is the need to frame the context of the paper. Establishing clinical efficacy for a potential therapeutic agent deployed during a public health crisis involves a climb through an epistemic ladder, and the comments from Dr Farag primarily highlight future rungs of that ladder. Our response can be summarized in three key points:\n\n【4】1) Safety First\n---------------\n\n【5】The primary purpose of our paper was to describe the key safety metrics following transfusion of convalescent plasma in 20,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As such, the data reported in our paper are descriptive. Although no comparator group was used in our safety report, there is substantial data about the range of expected incidence of key transfusion-related complications.\n\n【6】Risk factors and outcome of transfusion-related acute lung injury in the critically ill: a nested case-control study.\n\n【7】Transfusion-related acute lung injury in the critically ill: prospective nested case-control study.\n\n【8】Transfusion-associated circulatory overload: a clinical perspective.\n\n【9】In this context, the incidence of complications in this patient cohort was (objectively) low relative to historical perspective and is especially noteworthy given the critically ill cohort of transfused patients.\n\n【10】2) Exploratory Analyses of Efficacy Are Forthcoming\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【11】This analysis, focused on safety signals, should not be construed as evidence of efficacy. Adjusted analyses of mortality were beyond the scope of the paper. The many putative confounding factors that are raised by Dr Farag are justified and are being considered as part of adjusted analysis that is ongoing.\n\n【12】3) Pragmatic Study Design Versus Randomized Controlled Trial\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】The issue of a randomized controlled trial is of great interest; however, the EAP was a pragmatic study design, organized to allow routine clinical care to dictate the timing and administration of plasma with the collection of real world data. Changes in patient characteristics at the time of enrollment over the first ∼8 weeks of the pandemic should not come as a surprise as the world rapidly shared information on the treatment of COVID-19. Additionally, as more plasma became available during April and May, there was a shift toward earlier treatment in less severely or critically ill patients.\n\n【14】How the EAP evolved into a much bigger program to administer a product that — when the EAP started — scarcely existed across the country while obtaining rudimentary outcomes data will be addressed comprehensively in the coming months. This discussion will include the logistical issues associated with conducting a randomized controlled trial on convalescent plasma during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Also compared were B cells obtained from peripheral blood samples from 5 healthy controls and B cells from reactive lymph nodes from 3 otherwise healthy persons. The patients were treated at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, between January 15, 1991, and February 7, 2003. Mononuclear cells were stained by a 2-color (fluorescein isothiocyanate/phycoerythrin) flow cytometric assay using antibodies to the chemokine receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, and CCR7) and also to CD19.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Of the 45 patients in this study, 20 had Rai stage 0 disease, 12 had stage I disease, 3 had stage II disease, 2 had stage III disease, and 8 had stage IV disease.

We also found a significant increase in the expression of CXCR4 and CCR7 in B-CLL cells from patients with stage IV compared with stage 0 disease ( _P_ \\=.001 and _P_ \\=.02, respectively).

Outcomes (lesion improvement and mortality) and their predictors were analyzed.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Nine patients (median age, 72 years \\[interquartile range (IQR), 44-82 years\\]; 78% women; 89% white race) were identified through MGH records. The literature review identified 107 patients (median age, 60 years \\[IQR, 49-72 years\\]; 77% women; 86% white race). Vitamin K antagonism and obesity were the most common concomitant factors. In the literature review, lower age ( _P_ <.001) and higher body mass index ( _P_ \\=.03) were associated with the central location of lesions, whereas vitamin K antagonism was associated with the peripheral location ( _P_ \\=.009). In the MGH series, median survival was 24.0 months (95% CI, 7.8-36.0 months), and 33% (95% CI, 14%-60%) had lesion improvement by 6 months. In the literature review, median survival was 4.2 months (95% CI, 1.9-5.9 months), median time to lesion improvement was 5.9 months (95% CI, 3.9-8.9 months), and none of the treatments were associated with lesion improvement or survival.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】This description of concomitant traits may augment an earlier recognition of NNC.

The syndrome can be associated with autoimmune conditions, especially endocrine disorders. Typically, inheritance is autosomal recessive, and abnormal T-cellmediated immunity is thought to be the underlying deficit. We describe a 27–year-old man with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion, in whom both lymphocyte blastogenesis and delayedtype skin reactivity to _Candida_ antigens were normal. No– table features of the case include autoimmune hemolytic anemia, probable hypoparathyroidism, and hypogonadal hypogonadism.\n\n【1】CMCC ( chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis )\n\n【2】Patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMCC), a complex congenital immunodeficiency syndrome, have recurrent candidal infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes.\n\n【3】Invasive candidiasis is rare, but noncandidal infections are frequent and can be serious.\n\n【4】Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is associated with various autoimmune phenomena, particularly endocrinopathies (hypoparathyroidism, hypoadrenalism, hypothyroidism, type I diabetes, and gonadal failure).\n\n【5】Consequently, CMCC is also known as the autoimmune polyendocrinopathycandidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy syndrome.\n\n【6】The inheritance of CMCC is typically autosomal recessive. A single gene encoding for a transcription factor known as AIRE (autoimmune regulator) is mutated in patients with this inheritance pattern.\n\n【7】Several kindreds with an apparently autosomal dominant form of CMCC have been reported, but the genetic abnormalities are unknown in such patients.\n\n【8】Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis: immunologic studies of three generations of a single family.\n\n【9】We describe a 27–year-old man with CMCC inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion in whom autoimmune hemolytic anemia developed. Other important features of the case include probable hypoparathyroidism, hypogonadal hypogonadism, selective IgG2 antibody subclass deficiency, recurrent respiratory infections, and death of the patient's affected father at a young age due to pharyngeal cancer.\n\n【10】REPORT OF A CASE\n----------------\n\n【11】A 27–year-old man presented to our clinic for evaluation of CMCC. Onychomycosis had developed on all 20 digits when he was approximately 3 years of age. He was otherwise healthy until age 18, when he had frequent lower respiratory tract infections that necessitated hospitalization and treatment with intravenous antibiotics on 2 occasions. Subsequently, a chronic scaling, erythematous dermatosis developed; the dermatosis improved with brief courses of fluconazole and worsened with oral corticosteroids. At age 25, the patient noted scleral icterus and was found to have a hemoglobin concentration of 8 g/dL. Evaluation disclosed hemolytic anemia associated with a warm-reactive erythrocyte autoantibody, and he was treated with a brief course of corticosteroids, followed by folate supplementation. Low-grade hemolysis continued during the subsequent 2 years, but his hemoglobin concentration was maintained at more than 10 g/dL.\n\n【12】Physical examination of the patient at our clinic revealed onychomycosis  and large erythematous, scaling plaques on his legs, trunk, arms, and groin . No mucosal lesions were seen.\n\n【13】Figure 1 Feet of a 27-year-old man with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, demonstrating onychomycosis and superficial scaling, erythematous skin lesions.\n\n【14】Figure 2 Erythematous, scaling, pruritic plaques on patient's legs. Skin scrapings showed _Candida_ organisms.\n\n【15】### Hematologic and Immunologic Studies\n\n【16】A complete blood cell count demonstrated mild normocytic anemia (hemoglobin concentration, 11.7 g/dL). Peripheral blood smears revealed spherocytes and mild reticulocytosis. The serum haptoglobin level was undetectable, lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated at 299 U/L (reference ranges shown parenthetically) (92–202 U/L), and serum total bilirubin level was elevated at 1.5 mg/dL (0.1–1.1 mg/dL), consistent with ongoing hemolysis. Results of a red cell direct antiglobulin (Coombs') test were positive (1+) with both anti-IgG and anti-C3–complement reagents. A warm reactive erythrocyte autoantibody was present. After warm autoabsorption, no alloantibody activity could be demonstrated against a standard panel of red cells. Results of iron studies, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the C-reactive protein level were normal. Total lymphocyte count and flow-cytometric lymphocyte subset analysis were normal.\n\n【17】Total IgA, IgM, and IgG levels were normal, but serum IgE was undetectable. IgG subclass analysis revealed a mild selective deficiency of IgG2 at 115 mg/dL (149–586 mg/dL). Interleukin 5 levels were 2 pg/mL (<8 pg/mL).\n\n【18】Results of in vitro studies of neutrophil function were normal, including random migration, _Escherichia coli_ at tractant, and zymosan assays. Lymphocyte blastogenesis induced by _Candida_ antigen and tetanus toxoid was normal on 2 occasions. Mitogen-induced lymphocyte blastogenesis by phytohemagglutinin, pokeweed, and concanavalin A was normal.\n\n【19】IgG antibodies to 12 serotypes of _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ against which the patient had been vaccinated were present in protective antibody titers of greater than 200 ng/mL (Specialty Laboratories, Santa Monica, Calif), but the antibody levels were much less than the greater than 900 ng/mL expected for postimmunization serologic tests. Protective antibody levels were generated in response to immunization with tetanus toxoid, diphtheria toxoid, and live attenuated mumps virus (Specialty Laboratories).\n\n【20】Delayed hypersensitivity skin testing demonstrated absence of induration to purified protein derivative (5 U of tuberculin) at 24 and 48 hours. _Candida_ antigen (1:10 dilution, Hollister-Stier) provoked an induration of 11 × 12 mm at 24 hours and 15 × 14 mm at 48 hours. Dermatographism was absent.\n\n【21】Total serum complement activity was reduced at 16 U/mL (30–75 U/mL), as were the C4 complement level at less than 10 mg/dL (14–40 mg/dL) and the C2 complement function at 438 U/mL (15,354–46,242 U/mL, National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, Colo). The levels of C5, and C1–Q were normal. Results of a test for the human immunodeficiency virus was negative. An adenosine deaminase level was normal.\n\n【22】### Family History\n\n【23】The family history had no evidence of consanguinity. The patient's ethnic background is unknown.\n\n【24】The patient's paternal grandmother died when she was in her 40s of complications of cardiac valve surgery, and she had probable CMCC. She had a chronic scaling dermatosis and recurrent oral thrush. The medical histories of the paternal grandfather and maternal grandparents were unremarkable.\n\n【25】The patient's mother and her siblings are healthy. The patient's father was apparently healthy as a child, but chronic fungal skin infections developed during military service in Vietnam when he was approximately 20 years old, resulting in early discharge. The father subsequently had chronic oral thrush, scaling dermatosis, and dystrophic fingernails and toenails. In addition, the father had hemolytic anemia and had received multiple transfusions, and he had diabetes and recurrent pulmonary infections. He developed pharyngeal cancer at age 28 and died of complications of that disease at age 40. A paternal aunt was healthy.\n\n【26】The patient's brother and maternal half brother have no evidence of CMCC or autoimmune disease. The patient's 8–month-old daughter is in good health. Before the birth of this daughter, the patient's wife had 1 miscarriage.\n\n【27】### Endocrinologic and Other Studies\n\n【28】Skin scrapings of the patient's rash confirmed the presence of _Candida_ organisms.\n\n【29】On multiple occasions, the patient's ionized serum calcium level was low at 4.28 mg/dL (4.75–5.3 mg/dL), with a normal serum phosphorous and an inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone level, consistent with mild hypoparathyroidism. His serum total and free testosterone levels were low: 193 ng/dL (300–950 ng/dL) and 5.8 ng/dL (9–30 ng/dl.), respectively. The follicle-stimulating hormone level was increased at 17.2 IU/L (1–13 1U/L), with a normal luteinizing hormone level, consistent with hypogonadal hypogonadism. Results of thyroid and adrenal function studies were normal, as were those of the fasting serum glucose.\n\n【30】Computed tomography of the chest disclosed no evidence of a thymoma.\n\n【31】Results of peripheral blood karyotype were normal. Findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, including random biopsy specimens of the stomach, small bowel, colon, and esophagus, were unremarkable. Results of serologic tests for hepatitis B and C, specific syphilis, and human T-lymphotropic virus 1 and 2 were negative.\n\n【32】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【33】Our patient's case of CMCC has several unusual aspects. Normal lymphocyte blastogenesis in response to _Candida_ antigen and the preserved delayed hypersensitivity reaction to _Candida_ extract are uncommon in CMCC, particularly in adults.\n\n【34】T-cell–mediated immunity is apparently defective in most cases of CMCC, but in our patient the primary immune anomaly remains undefined. Defective neutrophil and monocyte function, impaired B-lymphocyte antibody response, abnormal complement function, and asplenia have also been described in patients with CMCC.\n\n【35】Our patient has a mild selective IgG2 immunoglobulin subclass deficiency. This has been reported previously in patients with CMCC, the importance of which is uncertain. Our patient had multiple noncandidal respiratory infections, which have been noted in other patients with CMCC.\n\n【36】These respiratory infections may be a result of reduced specific polysaccharide immune responsiveness, as demonstrated by the patient's low levels of antibody to S _pneumoniae._\n\n【37】Autosomal dominant inheritance of CMCC is unusual. One group of investigators argues that autosomal dominant CMCC in association with hypothyroidism should be considered a distinct syndrome.\n\n【38】Our findings of probable hypoparathyroidism and of hypogonadal gonadal hypogonadism in the setting of an inheritance pattern consistent with autosomal dominance suggest that this distinction may be unimportant.\n\n【39】Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is also a rare finding in CMCC. Hemolytic anemia was reported in a single series of 3 patients with CMCC.\n\n【40】A positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs') test result without hemolysis was reported in 4 other patients with CMCC. 2 In our patient, the hematologic and biochemical evidence of ongoing hemolysis was convincing (anemia, undetectable haptoglobin level, elevated lactate dehydrogenase and total bilirubin levels, a warmreactive erythrocyte autoantibody, spherocytes, and reticulocytosis). We suspect that our patient's hypocomplementemia was due to hemolysis alone, not to an underlying CMCC-related complement deficiency such as that reported by Drew.\n\n【41】If his C2 complement deficiency were a primary disorder, autoimmune disease would be expected but not CMCC. Despite the ongoing hemolysis, avoiding splenectomy seems prudent in this patient because of the important role of the spleen in humoral immunity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

At the beginning of the 20th century, the causes were poorly understood and treatment was limited to surgery because antithyroid drugs and radioactive iodine (RAI) were unavailable until the early 1940s. Because of high surgical mortality, treatment was often delayed until the condition was advanced, and a multistage procedure might be required. Initially, hot water was injected into the thyroid, then a thyroid artery was ligated, and subsequently one or both thyroid lobes were resected. Furthermore, critically ill patients who survived surgery risked postoperative death from thyroid storm.\n\n【3】Understanding of the etiology, pathology, physiology, clinical manifestations, and management of hyperthyroidism has evolved over the past 100 years, and new insights continue to emerge. Mayo Clinic physicians and scientists, working across disciplines, have contributed importantly to understanding this illness. This review of the Mayo Clinic experience will highlight these achievements, including pathologic clarification of the most common forms of hyperthyroidism, isolation of a crystalline product of thyroid hormone, development of a basal metabolism laboratory, discovery of a method to reduce postoperative mortality, investigation of the kinetics of thyroid hormones using radioisotopes, development and/or establishing the clinical utility of laboratory tests to diagnose and monitor therapy for hyperthyroidism, clinical characterization of extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves disease, surgical management of severe Graves ophthalmopathy, the role of orbital radiotherapy, and the pathogenesis of Graves ophthalmopathy.\n\n【4】The Early Days (1901-1937)\n--------------------------\n\n【5】Charles H. Mayo (1865-1939) developed an early interest in thyroid surgery when he and his brother resected a massive goiter in 1890, and by 1904 reported his experience with thyroidectomy on 40 patients with exophthalmic goiter. Performing thousands of thyroidectomies, he was known as the Father of American Thyroid Surgery. He and his brother William J. Mayo (1861-1939) hired Henry Plummer (1874-1936) in 1901 as one of the early members of Mayo Clinic. As a boy, Plummer had known the first goiter patient of the Mayo brothers, and he too developed an early interest in the thyroid. A superb diagnostician, Plummer classified 4 types of goiters on the basis of his clinical observations: hyperplastic/exophthalmic (toxic and nontoxic) and nonhyperplastic/adenomatous (toxic and nontoxic).\n\n【6】In 1905, Plummer and the Mayo brothers hired a pathologist Dr Louis B. Wilson (1866-1943) to develop the clinic's laboratories . Wilson confirmed Plummer's clinical findings by correlating with surgical pathology, noting that 99% of hyperplastic goiters but only 23% of adenomatous goiters were toxic.\n\n【7】Wilson is best remembered for introducing the frozen section technique to Mayo Clinic surgeons. Of note, his second wife was Maud Mellish (1862-1933). Mellish, a nurse, was hired in 1907 at the recommendation of Dr Albert Ochsner to organize and expand the medical library, and it is said that she rescued physicians' medical writings from a basement coalbin. From 1909 to 1933 she reviewed all manuscripts as Mayo Clinic's first medical editor and edited the _Collected Papers of the Mayo Clinic_ . She was, therefore, an integral contributor to the successful dissemination of the early articles on hyperthyroidism, and became an honorary member of Mayo Clinic faculty. Upon her death, Mayo Clinic closed during her funeral.\n\n【8】Louis Wilson later died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\n【9】Figure 1 Dr Louis B. Wilson (upper left), Dr Edward C. Kendall (upper right), Dr John Pemberton (lower right), Dr Samuel Haines (lower left). Dr H.S. Plummer (center left) and Dr C.H. Mayo (center right) at the cornerstone ceremonies of the new Mayo Clinic building on June 22, 1927 (center).\n\n【10】(Reprinted with permission from the Mayo Historical Unit.)\n\n【11】On February 1, 1914, Dr Edward C. Kendall (1886-1972), a research chemist with a PhD from Columbia University, began his appointment to the Mayo Clinic faculty to head the biochemistry section . He was working on identifying the active substance of the thyroid gland, and on Christmas day (11 months after his arrival) isolated a crystalline iodine–containing structure, which he called “thyroxin.”\n\n【12】Kendall was unable to identify the chemical structure of thyroxine, but later identified cortisone, and for that shared the Nobel Prize with Dr Philip Hench, a Mayo rheumatologist, and Thaddeus Reichstein from Switzerland.\n\n【13】Mayo Clinic consultants established an early relationship with premier hospitals in Boston, with Dr William Mayo first visiting Massachusetts General Hospital in 1898. In 1916, Plummer recruited Dr Walter Boothby (1880-1953). Boothby received his MD at Harvard and headed the respiration laboratory at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston where he delivered ether anesthesia for neurosurgical patients of his chief, Dr Harvey Cushing . Joining Boothby at Mayo Clinic was his assistant Miss Irene Sandiford (1889-1978), a recent Radcliffe College graduate who received her PhD at Mayo Foundation in 1919. They established a metabolic laboratory (with Boothby as the head of the section of metabolism), measured the basal metabolic rate (BMR) in thousands of patients, and showed that elevated BMR decreased to normal soon after thyroidectomy.\n\n【14】Around that time, Plummer speculated that exophthalmic goiter was caused by “intensive stimulation of unknown source”\n\n【15】(eg, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin) and also “the possibility of an incompletely iodized thyroxin molecule” (eg, T3). Presumably with this theory in mind, in 1922 Plummer began giving Lugol's iodine to patients with exophthalmic goiter. Symptoms improved dramatically within days, surgical mortality decreased, and staged thyroid operations were no longer needed.\n\n【16】Plummer presided over a popular weekly “goiter lunch” in which internists, surgeons, pathologists, and chemists gathered to discuss cases. These meetings, as well as the mandatory weekly staff meetings wherein presentations were followed by discussions and were published in the _Staff Meetings of the Mayo Clinic_ , promoted collegial interactions contributing to the multidisciplinary approach to patient care. The Mayo brothers also visited Johns Hopkins in the 1890s and, according to Clapesattle, liked the “congenial, gay, cooperative group…of internist (Osler), surgeon (Halsted), gynecologist (Kelly) and pathologist (Welch) and their assistants.”\n\n【17】Figure 2 Left panel: In the Respiration Laboratory at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital, in 1914: Left, Professor John Scott Haldane; Center, Dr Walter M.

Boothby, M.D.—The wellsprings of anesthesiology, _N Engl J Med_ . 276(10), p. 558, Copyright 1967 Massachusetts Medical Society, and the Mayo Historical Unit.)\n\n【19】These early Mayo Clinic pioneers made important contributions outside their primary responsibilities as Mayo Clinic clinicians. Plummer helped design and oversee the construction of 2 clinic buildings, the 1914 Building and the 1928 Building (later renamed the Plummer Building) , and the processes within to provide efficient patient flow for a rapidly expanding practice. He also replaced the original patient ledgers kept by each physician with a centralized medical record that permitted reviews of the many patients, both for quality improvement and for publication.\n\n【20】Wilson became dedicated to medical education at the clinic and nationally (as President of the American Association of Medical Colleges and a member of the National Board of Medical Examiners) and developed an interest in ballistics research for the US Army. Charles Mayo was elected President of the American Medical Association, among many national honors. Boothby, with his background in respiratory physiology, subsequently developed, with colleagues, the Boothby-Lovelace-Bubulion oxygen mask used in high-altitude aviation. For this invention they received the Collier Trophy from President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939. Boothby headed the section of Aviation Medicine (1942) and assisted Colonel Charles Lindbergh  in the development of oxygen supplementation for high-altitude flight during World War II.\n\n【21】Two other early consultants had a particular interest in the thyroid. One was Dr Samuel Haines (1892-1993) . Haines wanted to become a physician after being treated for typhoid fever at age 3 years by Dr Charles H. Mayo. Dr William Worrall Mayo (the father of William and Charles) was his godfather, and Haines met Kendall while working in the laboratory as a college student. Haines received his MD at Harvard in 1919, interned at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), then returned to Mayo Clinic and joined Plummer's section of thyroid disease in 1922, becoming its head in 1932. The second physician, Dr John de J. Pemberton (1887-1967), received his MD in 1911 from the University of Pennsylvania, became a Mayo Clinic surgical fellow in 1913, and was head of a section of surgery from 1918 to 1952 . He worked with Wilson in the laboratory of surgical pathology and in the operating room with Dr Charles Mayo. Pemberton published on surgical aspects of thyroid disease, including hyperthyroidism.\n\n【22】He and others including Drs Edwin Kepler (1894-1947), Harold Dunlap (1895-1947), and colleagues characterized the hepatic, cardiac, and psychic features of patients with severe, often lethal, thyroid disease. Dunlap and Kepler also identified cases of periodic paralysis in patients with exophthalmic goiter.\n\n【23】Figure 3 Mayo Clinic Endocrine Group in 1951. Front row: C.F. Gastineau, L.O.

Bennett.\n\n【24】(Reprinted with permission from the Mayo Historical Unit.)\n\n【25】Midcentury (1946-1971)\n----------------------\n\n【26】Within a few years of the deaths of Henry Plummer and Charles H. Mayo, therapy for hyperthyroidism shifted from surgery to radioiodine and antithyroid drugs. Although World War II interrupted academic progress, the underpinnings of a postwar invigoration of thyroid research at Mayo Clinic were established a few years earlier. Dr F. Raymond Keating Jr (1911-1969) became a fellow at Mayo Clinic in 1938, and 4 years later, previous connections with Boston were rekindled. Dr Haines arranged for Keating to spend a 6-month sabbatical in 1942 at the MGH and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston where the exploration of radioiodine for medical research and therapy was in its infancy. In a 1983 letter (on file, Mayo Historical Unit) from Dr Haines to David Becker, MD, at Cornell, Haines said: \\[W\\]hen Ray Keating finished his Fellowship we asked Howard Means to let him go to the M.G.H. for 6 months. We were especially interested in having him see what Means, (Saul) Hertz, and (Rulon) Rawson were doing with radioiodine, a program which, as you know, was carried out with Robley Evans and Wendell Peacock from M.I.T…We also wanted Ray to see as much of Fuller Albright as possible, as we were concerned that he, Fuller, was seeing so much more hyperparathyroidism than we were. Ray's stay in Boston was very successful in both ways, and when he came back he had arranged with Evans to have small amounts of I-131 sent to him to be used in some studies in chicks.\n\n【27】Keating published several articles with his mentors in Boston. Dr Haines goes on to say: \\[A\\]s soon as radioiodine could be available from Oak Ridge we applied for it. This was in 1946, and it was sent to the laboratory of Marschelle Power in our chemistry department. From the beginning a series of investigative programs were carried out by several men…I do not remember the exact date we gave the first therapeutic dose, but I remember the patient—a woman with recurrent exophthalmic goiter, mitral stenosis, and cardiac decompensation, in whom the risk of further surgical resection was estimated to be great. She got a good result from I-131.\n\n【28】In 1946, when 131-Iodine became available from Oak Ridge, TN, a lengthy collaboration developed between Drs Keating, Haines, Marschelle Power, and Alexander Albert. Dr Power (1894-1982) received a PhD in organic chemistry in 1923, became a Mayo Clinic consultant in biochemistry in 1930, and was section head from 1947 to 1957. Dr Albert (1911-1997) received his PhD and MD from Harvard and his research fellowship at the MGH where he worked with Means and Rawson in the Thyroid Clinic and where his interest was using radioiodine to study iodine metabolism. He joined Mayo Clinic in 1946 and became head of the endocrine lab and later chair of the Department of Endocrine Research. Other members of the team of Mayo Clinic consultants studying thyroid physiology, biochemistry, diagnostics, and therapeutics included Drs Haines, Pemberton, chemists Harold Mason (1901-1992) and Ralph Ellefson, William McConahey (1916-2004), William Mayberry, Charles M. Blackburn (1920-1979), Alvin Hayles (1915-1988), and Lewis Woolner. In addition, trainees who went on to have distinguished thyroid careers elsewhere included Drs Arnold S. Jackson, Brown Dobyns, J. Edward Rall, and Richard Benua. The studies during this era were impressive, and included radioisotopic studies from human exophthalmic goiter tissue slices, animal studies, and humans with hyperthyroidism that elaborated the changes in iodine kinetics, lipid metabolism, and the effects of antithyroid drugs.\n\n【29】Diagnostic tests were established for clinical use including thyroidal RAI uptake, protein-bound iodine, T4, and T3.\n\n【30】Dr Rall, in 1996, sent a document titled “A Fellow's Picture of the Mayo Clinic Half a Century Ago” (on file, Mayo Historical Unit) to Mayo Clinic. His research involved “thyroid hormone, the new technique of paper chromatography and radioactive iodine.” He describes the Mayo Clinic as “remarkably tolerant…never a complaint or request for a progress report,” and he noted that all thyroid surgeries were done on the top floor of the Kahler hotel and “Marden Black (1910-1997) had the record for 21 thyroidectomies in one day.”\n\n【31】Recent Events (1982-2014)\n-------------------------\n\n【32】More recently, the focus at Mayo Clinic has been on extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves disease. Surgeons Drs James Garrity and George Bartley provided outcomes on orbital decompression for severe ophthalmopathy and collaborated in a series of studies with endocrinologist Dr Colum Gorman who, in a randomized trial, showed minimal benefit of orbital radiotherapy.\n\n【33】Results of transantral orbital decompression in 428 patients with severe Graves' ophthalmopathy.\n\n【34】A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of orbital radiotherapy for Graves' ophthalmopathy.\n\n【35】Dr Rebecca Bahn has focused on the pathogenesis of Graves eye disease in the laboratory and has carried her work into clinical trials.\n\n【36】Dr Vahab Fatourechi provided outcomes of a large cohort of patients with Graves dermopathy (pretibial myxedema) and with acropachy.\n\n【37】Many faculty members have contributed to other aspects of hyperthyroidism including inappropriate thyroid-stimulating hormone disorders (Drs Hossein Gharib and William Young), amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (Gharib), body composition before and after therapy of hyperthyroidism (Dr Michael Brennan), and laboratory diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction (Drs McConahey, Ian Hay, John Morris, and George Klee). Recent and current surgeons (Drs Clive Grant, Geoffrey Thompson, David Farley, and Melanie Richards) have shown that surgery is still the preferred method of treating toxic multinodular goiter (Plummer disease) at Mayo Clinic, while Grant, Thompson, Jon van Heerden, and pediatric endocrinologist Donald Zimmerman showed the continued value of surgery for Graves disease in childhood and adolescence.\n\n【38】The 20th century saw numerous advances in the diagnosis and treatment of hyperthyroidism. Its causes were initially ill-defined, its therapy limited to thyroidectomy, and related mortality was high (from cardiac complications or postoperative thyroid storm). Contributions from Mayo Clinic staff, spanning more than 100 years, have advanced our understanding of hyperthyroidism and greatly improved its treatment. The first notable achievement was that through broad collaboration including surgeon (C.H. Mayo), internist (Plummer), pathologist (Wilson), chemist (Kendall), and laboratory physiologist (Boothby); the causes and severity of hyperthyroidism could be gauged, thus guiding therapy. Second, the discovery that Lugol's iodine improved hyperthyroidism clinically and reduced postoperative mortality was practice-changing and life-saving. Third, the value of radioisotopes for studying thyroid pathophysiology and as diagnostic and therapeutic tools was established. Fourth, clinicians and laboratory colleagues documented a series of increasingly specific diagnostic tests for hyperthyroidism, beginning with the BMR, then RAI uptake, PBI, T4, and T3. Fifth, extrathyroidal manifestations of Graves disease were characterized clinically, orbital decompression was shown to improve visual acuity and reduce proptosis, and more severe ophthalmopathy correlated with dermopathy and acropachy. Investigations into the immunologic underpinnings and clinical trials for treatment of Graves ophthalmopathy are ongoing. Finally, various other causes of thyrotoxicosis have been the subject of clinical research.\n\n【39】Mayo Clinic and its faculty have been leaders in thyroid research and practice for more than a century. Beginning with Henry Plummer in 1933, 11 staff members (Drs Plummer, Pemberton, Haines, Albert, Keating, McConahey, Hayles, Gorman, Bahn, Gharib, and Smallridge) and 4 trainees (Drs Jackson, Dobyns, Rall, and Bryan Haugen \\[Mayo Medical School\\]) have been president of the American Thyroid Association. Four staff members were president of the Endocrine Society (Drs Kendall, Mason, Albert, and William Young), and 2 (Drs Mason and Albert) also received the Fred Conrad Koch Lifetime Achievement Award. The 21st century promises to continue this legacy and bring, through innovations in clinical care and research, new insights into the evaluation and management of patients with hyperthyroidism.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

And for almost as long as human beings have been waging war, societies have struggled with two fundamental questions about these psychological wounds. First, how do we identify and define these unseen wounds, wounds that lead to the type of consequences that defy simple physiologic explanation? Second, given that some people clearly return from war with psychological issues that impair their ability to function, how do we justly compensate those who experience these psychological wounds (an issue that becomes particularly salient as the number of people affected increases)?\n\n【1】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【2】PTSD ( posttraumatic stress disorder ), VA ( US Department of Veterans Affairs ), WWI ( World War I )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Data including thrombophilia profiles were extracted from the medical records of each patient. Survival status was determined using patient registration data and the Social Security Death Index. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and associations were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Sixty-four of the 101 patients underwent thrombophilia testing. Of these, a complete test panel was performed in 55 and a partial panel in 9. Severe thrombophilias observed in 60% (33 of 55) of the patients included antiphospholipid antibody syndrome protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiencies or combined thrombophilias. Of the 55 patients, severe thrombophilia (85%, 23 of 27) was noted in patients who were not on warfarin at the time of testing (27). Nonsevere thrombophilias included heterozygous factor V Leiden (n=2) and plasminogen deficiency (n=1). For the comparison of survival, patients were divided into 3 treatment categories: Warfarin (n=63), other anticoagulants (n=20), and no anticoagulants (n=18). There was no statistically significant survival difference between treatment groups.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Laboratory testing reveals a strikingly high prevalence of severe thrombophilias in patients with calciphylaxis, underscoring the importance of congenital and acquired thrombotic propensity potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of this disease.

There are at least three reasons for assessing burnout in medical students. First, the occurrence of this phenomenon in medical students would be both puzzling and concerning: getting into medical school is such a competitive and arduous process that one would have thought that the relief and exhilaration of being accepted into and then experiencing medical school would surmount any such risks of burnout. Second, understanding the scope and underpinnings of this phenomenon will hopefully lead to strategies and processes in medical school that mitigate its occurrence. Third, the occurrence of burnout in medical school may be a harbinger for burnout later in one’s medical career. Briggs et al surveyed more than 1100 medical students at 9 medical schools from December 27, 2020, through January 17, 2021. Burnout was assessed by the 2-item Maslach Burnout Inventory. In addition to demographic characteristics, the survey also obtained information pertaining to potential factors that may predispose to burnout. The data demonstrate that a staggering number of students (75.6%!) fulfilled the criteria for burnout as evidenced by high scores for emotional exhaustion and/or depersonalization; 46% of medical students scored high on both emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. Burnout was more prevalent in women compared with men, but comparably prevalent among races (White, Black, and Asian). Among the salient stressors that student generally identified as underlying burnout were sleep deprivation, less involvement with hobbies, less self-care, endeavoring to maintain good grades, less connectedness with social milieux, and insufficient regular exercise. The influence of these stressors variably affected female compared with male medical students, and medical students depending on their race. Briggs et al provide an illuminating discussion of their findings, which culminated in their “call to action” whereby medical schools may address and mitigate these stressors. There is something intrinsically lamentable that burnout already afflicts even those at the beginning of their journey – what may be expected to be filled with joy and hope - towards a physician’s career, and one they have chosen, in general, for the right and altruistic reasons. Briggs et al are to be commended for their timely evaluation of burnout in medical students and for offering specific recommendations that may mitigate and/or prevent this regrettable phenomenon.\n\n【3】The Epidemiology of Cutaneous Melanoma\n--------------------------------------\n\n【4】Melanoma is the most worrisome of all cutaneous cancers because of its propensity to spread. Campbell et al evaluated the incidence and mortality of cutaneous melanoma in middle-aged adults (40 to 60 years) diagnosed between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 2020. These authors employed the Rochester Epidemiology Project, the medical records-linkage system that gathers such records for residents in Olmsted County, Rochester, Minnestoa, who obtain their medical care at Mayo Clinic and other area medical centers. In analyses involving 858 patients, the age-adjusted and sex-adjusted incidence rates increased 52-fold for women between an earlier (1970 to 1979) and a later period (2011 to 2020), while for men, such incidence rates increased more than 6-fold. In analyses undertaken in more recent years, namely 2015 to 2020 compared with 2005 to 2009, incidence rates continued to rise in women, but plateaued in men. In more recent years, the risk of death due to melanoma decreased for either sex. In discussing their findings, the authors considered whether overdiagnosis of melanoma - a possibility suggested for the rising incidence of melanoma observed by others – may be relevant to the observed incidence rates. As Campbell et al point out, it seems unlikely that overdiagnosis, _per se_ , can explain the markedly different temporal profiles for incidence rates in men and women, especially as, in more recent years, incidence rates in men plateaued while increasing incidence rates in women were maintained. It is also possible that screening for skin cancer is more commonly undertaken in women compared with men. While such an explanation (as yet unproven) may underlie the observed findings in general, and accommodate overdiagnosis as a relevant consideration, the authors tellingly note that screening in women at increasingly greater rates would need to be sustained for each year during the last 15 years. Finally, Campbell et al point out other considerations that merit further study including increased use of tanning beds by women, menopausal effects, and the effects of hormonal therapy. The decline in mortality from melanoma, as observed in this study, is an encouraging aspect of the evolving epidemiology of melanoma, and likely reflects the combined salutary effects of emphasis on screening, novel medical therapies, and improved surgical management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

He had no fever, constitutional symptoms, blurry vision, headaches, back pain, weakness, palpitations, or tremors and no personal or family history of hypertension. He did not use alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs.\n\n【1】Physical examination at the emergency department revealed an overweight man with a BP of 222/167 mm Hg, pulse rate of 123 beats/min, temperature of 36.7°C, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 91% while the patient received 2 L/min of oxygen by nasal cannula. Peripheral pulses were equal and synchronous. Findings on cardiac examination were notable for a sustained laterally displaced apical impulse and a third heart sound with no murmurs. Pulmonary examination revealed bibasilar crackles and reduced breaths sounds at the right lung base. No masses or bruits were noted on abdominal examination. Pitting lower extremity edema was present to the knees bilaterally. There were no focal neurologic deficits. A funduscopic examination was not performed.\n\n【2】Initial laboratory studies yielded the following results (reference ranges shown parenthetically): hemoglobin, 16 g/dL (13.5-17.5 g/dL); creatinine, 2.0 mg/dL (0.8-1.3 mg/dL); sodium, 137 mEq/L (135-145 mEq/L); potassium, 3.8 mEq/L (3.6-5.2 mEq/L); and serum urea nitrogen, 38 mg/dL (8-24 mg/dL). The N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level was 12,629 pg/mL (≤56 pg/mL). The troponin T value was 0.4 ng/mL at baseline, 0.2 ng/mL at 3 hours, and 0.3 ng/mL at 6 hours after presentation (<0.01 ng/mL). Urinalysis revealed no abnormalities. Findings on electrocardiography included sinus tachycardia, rightward axis, left atrial enlargement, and left ventricular hypertrophy with secondary ST-T abnormalities. Chest radiography showed notable cardiac enlargement as well as mild pulmonary vascular congestion and a small right pleural effusion.\n\n【3】*   1\n\n【4】    **Given these findings, which _one_ of the following is the _most accurate_ diagnosis at this time?**\n\n【5】    *   a\n\n【6】        Accelerated/malignant hypertension\n\n【7】    *   b\n\n【8】        Hypertensive urgency\n\n【9】    *   c\n\n【10】        Hypertensive emergency\n\n【11】    *   d\n\n【12】        Acute coronary syndrome\n\n【13】    *   e\n\n【14】        Flash pulmonary edema\n\n【15】Although accelerated/malignant hypertension may present with severely elevated BP, it cannot be diagnosed in the absence of documented funduscopic findings of retinal exudates, hemorrhages, or papilledema. Hypertensive urgency refers to severe elevation in BP without symptoms or evidence of acute or progressive target organ injury. In this patient, the clinical and laboratory findings suggest acute target organ damage with involvement of the heart and kidneys. Hence, hypertensive emergency is the most accurate diagnosis at this time. The clinical presentation and electrocardiographic findings are not consistent with acute coronary syndrome in the absence of typical chest pain, specific ST-T changes, or a marked increase in cardiac biomarker levels. Flash pulmonary edema refers to acute hypertensive pulmonary congestion in the setting of severe diastolic dysfunction, especially in elderly women with systemic hypertension.\n\n【16】The patient continued to have mild shortness of breath with a nonproductive cough but had no new symptoms suggestive of additional target organ damage.\n\n【17】*   2\n\n【18】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ next step in the management of this patient?**\n\n【19】    *   a\n\n【20】        Computed axial tomography of the chest with pulmonary embolism (PE) protocol\n\n【21】    *   b\n\n【22】        Intravenous (IV) antihypertensive infusion\n\n【23】    *   c\n\n【24】        Oral β-blockers\n\n【25】    *   d\n\n【26】        Cardiothoracic surgery consultation\n\n【27】    *   e\n\n【28】        Transfer to the cardiology service\n\n【29】Computed axial tomography of the chest with PE protocol is premature at this time in the absence of features concerning for aortic dissection or high probability for PE. Given the strong evidence of target organ damage, it is vital to address the underlying elevated BP precipitating the cardiac emergency; therefore, an IV antihypertensive infusion should be initiated immediately. Although oral medications are used to lower BP in hypertensive urgency, the presence of target organ damage in this case renders the use of oral β-blockers alone inadequate. No immediate surgical concerns warrant consultation at this time. Intensive care is required, and transfer to a lower level of care is inappropriate.\n\n【30】The patient received 3 IV boluses of metoprolol, and IV nitroglycerin infusion was initiated before transfer to the cardiac intensive care unit.\n\n【31】*   3\n\n【32】    **For the immediate management of this patient's hypertensive emergency, which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ goal?**\n\n【33】    *   a\n\n【34】        Reduction of diastolic BP by 15% to 20% by the end of the first hour\n\n【35】    *   b\n\n【36】        Reduction to normal BP over the next 24 hours\n\n【37】    *   c\n\n【38】        Reduction to systolic BP of 110 mm Hg within 10 minutes\n\n【39】    *   d\n\n【40】        Immediate reduction of BP to less than 185/110 mm Hg\n\n【41】    *   e\n\n【42】        Reduction of systolic BP by 50% over the next 6 hours\n\n【43】Hypertensive emergencies must be treated expediently to prevent progression of target organ damage. The goal at presentation is to carefully reduce the diastolic BP by 15% to 20% or to about 110 mm Hg over the first hour while monitoring for evidence of worsening target organ injury. In hypertensive crises without target organ damage, BP can be gradually reduced to baseline over the next 24 to 48 hours. The only indication for immediate reduction of BP within 10 minutes is aortic dissection, which is not present at this time. There is no evidence of ischemic stroke, which would require thrombolytic therapy and a prerequisite BP of less than 185/110 mm Hg. After the initial reduction of diastolic BP by 15% to 20%, systolic BP is gradually reduced by 25% over the next 6 hours.\n\n【44】The patient's BP on arrival at the cardiac intensive care unit was 199/105 mm Hg. He was transitioned to IV labetalol infusion with a plan for additional IV hydralazine boluses as needed for optimal control.\n\n【45】*   4\n\n【46】    **Which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ next step in the investigation of this patient's hypertensive emergency?**\n\n【47】    *   a\n\n【48】        Computed axial tomography of the abdomen and pelvis\n\n【49】    *   b\n\n【50】        Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE)\n\n【51】    *   c\n\n【52】        Renal angiography\n\n【53】    *   d\n\n【54】        Measurement of urinary metanephrine\n\n【55】    *   e\n\n【56】        Right upper quadrant ultrasonography\n\n【57】Computed axial tomography of the abdomen and pelvis may be useful to identify underlying causes of the severe hypertension. In particular, it would be helpful to rule out potential causes such as pheochromocytoma, primary aldosteronism, or renal cell carcinoma. However, it would be inappropriate as the immediate next step because the priority should be to correct target organ damage before undertaking a search for the underlying cause. Moreover, it would be relatively contraindicated by the presence of acute kidney injury. Transthoracic echocardiography would help characterize the type and severity of heart failure and differentiate potential causes of heart failure such as valvular disease, ischemia, and cardiomyopathy. Renal angiography would be premature at this time in the absence of evidence of renal artery stenosis. Although measurement of urinary metanephrine would be important to exclude pheochromocytoma as a cause of the hypertensive crisis, it should not take priority over characterizing the extent of target organ damage. No information obtained thus far provides any evidence to support an indication for right upper abdominal ultrasonography.\n\n【58】The patient underwent urgent TTE, which revealed severe left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of 10% to 15%, grade 3/4 left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, and moderately increased concentric left ventricular wall thickness. There were no regional wall motion abnormalities. He had a sustained clinical response overnight in response to IV labetalol with systolic BP in the range of 180 to 200 mm Hg. He was transitioned to oral carvedilol at 6.25 mg twice daily and low-dose hydralazine at 10 mg thrice daily with further reduction in systolic BP to the mid 150 mm Hg range. Renal ultrasonography showed normal echogenicity, size, and cortical thickness of both kidneys and no focal mass, hydronephrosis, or renal artery stenosis. He was given a 40-mg dose of furosemide for diuresis with a resultant urine output of 2.3 L over the course of the night. He was transferred to the cardiology service the next day for further workup. However, progressive dyspnea developed over the course of the day, and an additional 20 mg of IV furosemide was administered. He was subsequently noted to have mild right arm weakness, right facial droop, and slurred speech. His systolic BP at that time ranged from 130 to 140 mm Hg. Hydralazine was withheld, and the dose of carvedilol was decreased. An urgent neurology evaluation was requested.\n\n【59】*   5\n\n【60】    **At this time, which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ explanation for the patient's symptoms?**\n\n【61】    *   a\n\n【62】        Embolic stroke\n\n【63】    *   b\n\n【64】        Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\n【65】    *   c\n\n【66】        Intracranial tumor\n\n【67】    *   d\n\n【68】        Intracerebral hemorrhage\n\n【69】    *   e\n\n【70】        Cerebral hypoperfusion\n\n【71】Although traditional risk factors for thromboembolism such as diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, or arrhythmia were absent, the severely decreased left ventricular function raises the possibility of left ventricular thrombus. However, the recent TTE did not demonstrate an intraventricular thrombus, which makes an embolic stroke less likely. The neurologic deficits in this case were not preceded by a severe sudden headache, which is the classic presentation of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient has no signs or symptoms that suggest the presence of an intracranial tumor. It is unlikely that he has an intracerebral hemorrhage because this disorder is typically associated with extremely high BP. Given his normalized BP at the time of onset of his neurologic deficits, cerebral hypoperfusion from impaired autoregulation in the setting of aggressive treatment of severe hypertension best explains the new findings.\n\n【72】Emergent computed axial tomography of the head was negative for intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or signs of acute stroke but demonstrated features consistent with chronic small-vessel ischemic disease as well as old lacunar infarcts in the thalamus and the corona radiata. The patient was transferred back to the cardiac intensive care unit for closer monitoring of his BP and frequent neurologic evaluations. Further neurologic examination on arrival was notable for improvement in his neurologic deficits with only a residual pronator drift in the right hand and diminished alternating movements. Antihypertensive medications were withheld, and a target systolic BP was set at 150 to 160 mm Hg for a period of 2 to 4 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging and angiography of the head and neck without contrast showed no high-grade carotid stenosis or features suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome. Previously observed white matter infarcts and features of chronic ischemic changes were again seen. Over the next 4 days of hospitalization, carvedilol was reintroduced at low dose and was slowly titrated upward to maintain the new target BP. A diuretic regimen was initiated to correct the peripheral edema.\n\n【73】An evaluation for secondary causes of hypertension such as pheochromocytoma or hyperaldosteronism yielded negative findings because serum metanephrine, plasma aldosterone, and renin activity were all within normal limits. The urinary metanephrine level was mildly elevated but on repeated studies was found to be normal. The patient underwent an adenosine sestamibi stress test, which showed severe global hypokinesis but no evidence of infarction or stress-induced ischemia. Overnight oximetry obtained for evaluation of suspected sleep apnea yielded abnormal results, suggesting a sleep-associated breathing disorder. The patient was scheduled to undergo formal polysomnography in the outpatient setting. He was discharged in clinically stable condition a week after admission with a regimen of carvedilol, 6.25 mg twice daily, lisinopril, 5 mg/d, and oral furosemide, 80 mg/d.\n\n【74】Discussion\n----------\n\n【75】More than a billion people worldwide are affected by systemic hypertension. It is estimated that 1% to 2% will develop severe acute elevations of BP requiring immediate medical therapy.\n\n【76】Elevations of systolic BP greater than 179 mm Hg or diastolic BP greater than 109 mm Hg are usually referred to as hypertensive crisis.\n\n【77】Such elevations are classified as hypertensive emergencies when target organ damage is present and as hypertensive urgencies when it is absent. Hypertensive crises are thought to result from a sudden increase in systemic vascular resistance. The ensuing ischemia and hypoperfusion of critical arterial beds (cerebral, coronary, and renal) result in a hypertensive emergency.\n\n【78】Common manifestations of hypertensive emergency are shortness of breath, chest pain, headache, altered mental status, and focal neurologic deficits. Hence, a comprehensive evaluation at presentation must be expedient and targeted toward identifying and preventing the progression of target organ damage. After elicitation of a complete history and a thorough physical examination (including funduscopic examination), initial studies should include a complete metabolic panel, a cardiac biomarker panel, a complete blood cell count with peripheral smear, urinalysis, chest radiography, and electrocardiography. Imaging studies such as computed tomography of the head and chest, magnetic resonance imaging, and echocardiography should be tailored to the appropriate clinical scenario. A blood sample should be obtained for evaluation of plasma renin activity and measurement of aldosterone and catecholamine levels when secondary hypertension is suspected.\n\n【79】Immediate reduction of BP in a controlled manner should be accomplished in a monitored setting using a continuous infusion of a short-acting antihypertensive that can be titrated to prevent additional target organ damage, which may arise from hypoperfusion due to rapid and excessive correction of BP.

Intraoperative echocardiograms, surgical reports, and pathology reports were reviewed.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 382 patients (54±16 years, 82% men), there were 207 (54%) tricuspid (TAV), 167 (44%) bicuspid (BAV), 5 quadricuspid, and 3 unicuspid aortic valves. Isolated AR mechanisms (n=116, 30%) included cusp prolapse (n=44, 11%), restriction/retraction (n=33, 9%), aortic root dilatation (n=33, 9%), perforation (n=5, 1%), and fenestration (<1%); mixed mechanisms were present in 266 (70%). The most common mixed mechanism was root dilatation and prolapse (27% BAV vs 16% TAV, _P_ \\=.01). Valve repair (AVr) was performed in 31% BAV and 23% TAV ( _P_ \\=.06). Aortic surgery was more common in BAV (37% vs 27%, _P_ <.001). Overall, root dilatation was associated with AVr. In TAV, cusp prolapse and restriction/retraction were associated with replacement; in BAV, prolapse was associated with AVr. AR etiology was idiopathic in 43% TAV patients, 47% of whom had root dilatation.\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】BAV accounted for 44% of surgical referrals for AR and, compared with TAV, was more often associated with prolapse, root dilatation, and mixed mechanisms of AR.

Up to a point, the physician part of me does not either. But the part of me that is a patient? No doubt about it. I feel dumped.\n\n【2】A few months before I received my Aesculapian pink slip, I bumped into my not-yet-former doctor in the hallway. He gave me a friendly slap on the back and told me that my termination notice would be forthcoming. He said it had become harder and harder to fit me and several other physicians he took care of into an unforgiving clinical schedule that was increasingly beyond his control.\n\n【3】When the official announcement on his letterhead arrived via snail mail a few days later, his casual warning made the formal notice no less shocking. There, on paper and in 12-point type, the message was spelled out. It was frank. Over time, new administrative policies had become increasingly proscriptive about both how he parsed his clinical hours and whom he could treat. First, an administrative quest aimed at improving clinical efficiency and throughput for the specialized clinics to which he was primarily assigned had dictated that he no longer commandeer appointment slots designated for external referrals to accommodate the internal patients for whom he provided care. He was further instructed to limit his practice to the mission of his clinic: customized assessment, facilitation of subspecialty referrals throughout the institution, and integration of the results of these consultations. At first, he had responded by continuing to see his long-established physician-patients off the calendar and off the clock, although critically with ongoing support from physician extenders, front desk staff, appointment schedulers, and his secretary. But then a second administrative dictum came that decreed he must not appropriate support staff resources for the care of off-the-grid patients like me. In the aggregate, these policy changes compromised his ability to provide what he considered acceptable care. Even on his own time, he was not willing to treat his few remaining physician-patients in the absence of the same level of staff support afforded to his “official” patients, and who could blame him?\n\n【4】My former doctor tells me he has always considered it an honor and a privilege—never a burden—to care for fellow physicians. “Doctors are a special breed,” he says. “They're not the best patients. They blow stuff off or overreact. They self-medicate.” In his opinion, doctors need doctors who respect how much they know but ultimately have the self-confidence to tell them what to do. He expressed sincere regret that he felt left with no choice but to terminate caring for his small cadre of physicians.\n\n【5】In an era when physician wellness has become a professional buzz phrase, I can grudgingly laud my former doctor for deciding to reduce his exposure to uncompensated work, particularly when he was discouraged from using his clinic's most basic infrastructure for a small subset of his practice. Several of the national thought leaders on physician burnout are my professional colleagues, and they have developed their ideas and done their research to great acclaim.\n\n【6】Changes in burnout and satisfaction with work-life balance in physicians and the general US working population between 2011 and 2014.\n\n【7】Impact of organizational leadership on physician burnout and satisfaction.\n\n【8】Although I have not mentioned my particular situation to them, surely they would question the wisdom of administrative decisions that have made it nearly impossible for doctors like mine to maintain continuity of care with long-standing physician patients like me. I do not believe anyone meant—even inadvertently—to harm my well-being, even as I wonder whether rules have to be so absolute that patients like me lose their care, even as I further wonder whether, in this contemporary medical world, it is selfish of me to expect my doctor—or his clinic—to push these boundaries.\n\n【9】Experts in the care of physicians have long encouraged us to have doctors of our own we can rely on when we are ill, rather than turning to curbside consultations from friends or, even worse, treating ourselves.\n\n【10】Avoiding burnout: the personal health habits and wellness practices of US surgeons.\n\n【11】All these years I thought I had that covered by having a formal relationship with a highly talented general internist who saw me in his office for our appointments, looked after my general health screening as well as my idiosyncratic concerns, and documented the nature and outcomes of our interactions in the medical record, as he would for any patient.\n\n【12】On reflection after being dumped, I conclude that, despite the mainstream features of our interactions, it had always been an illicit arrangement we shared, our little secret. I had approached him on the psychiatric inpatient unit on which we both worked because I admired how he cared for our mutual patients. He was thoughtful, detail-oriented, not quick to order tests, but also not averse to doing so if his formulations of patients' problems demanded them. He took the necessary time to get to know his patients. He clearly liked them, and I liked that. When I asked him to be my doctor, he told me he had the flexibility to work me in before the workday officially began, over the noon hour, in between his “official” patients, or in his scant administrative time. No one needed to know about the irregular scheduling in a clinic not designed for ongoing care. Our “marriage”—if one can use that metaphor to describe the doctor-patient relationship—would be common-law, unsanctified by administrative “clergy,” a same-time-next-year sort of affair. We made it work for more than a decade.\n\n【13】Aware he was seeing me on the side as a favor, I tried not to be a difficult or demanding patient—not to ask more than a tiny aliquot of his time for my annual examinations. I looked forward to our assignations. Relaxed and unhurried, he would lean back in his office chair, elbows outstretched, hands interlocked behind his head, and launch into a therapeutic conversation that traversed the previous year's voyage. He would inquire about my recent health history while weaving in anecdotal strands about his children and the love of gardening we shared. He would ask about everything from the stresses of my job to the quality of my sex life.\n\n【14】Now and again issues arose that demanded urgent—even immediate—attention and coordination outside of these annual visits. Pericarditis, recurrent sinus infections, atypical asthma, abscessed teeth, peculiar skin lesions—he always found time to shoehorn me in, order the necessary tests and specialty consultations, and follow up on the results. I hated having to be a burden at these times, but sometimes I could not help it. Health crises typically respect the schedules of no man, not even a physician. He was my doctor.\n\n【15】In the aftermath of our breakup, I continue to ponder why he had been willing to assume my care in the first place. Maybe he had been operating from the increasingly quaint notion of “professional courtesy,” a venerable tradition that probably always came out of the professional's hide. I have always had—and continue to have—a small panel of such patients for whom no official beans are counted: physicians, trainees, challenging referrals from colleagues who believe that I have special (even unique) expertise to offer a patient. I have almost always said yes, even though my clinical department neither expects me to do this work nor allocates the time in my schedule template for me to do it. I consider myself to be honoring the memory of my maternal grandfather—dead before I was born—idealized by my mother as a doctor intensely and perpetually available to those lucky enough to fall under his care. Like my former doctor, I squeeze and sneak and juggle to work these referrals in. Maybe I am being duped—or duping myself—into considering it an honor to be “the doctor's doctor.” Instead of continuing to perform clinical and educational duties that total far more than the 1.0 full-time equivalent I am allotted for the work that I do, I could more profitably use the time that I spend treating my colleagues and other special request patients for puttering in my garden, practicing my clarinet, going on bicycle rides, or attending yoga class. Maybe I should start saying “no” more often, but so far, I just cannot bring myself to do it.\n\n【16】In fairness, when my doctor dumped me, he did not abandon me without potential options. He gave me the names of several respected colleagues whose calendars grant them time to see local people, including physicians, and whose clinics provide the ancillary staff necessary to assist in efficient, team-based delivery of coordinated care. He suggested I ask whether one of them might be willing to take me on. He also reminded me that our institution has taken steps to make sure its staff gets necessary care by hiring a cadre of internists fresh out of training specifically to look after physician staff members. (To its credit, our Office of Staff Services has recently advertised this option in an effort to reach staff doctors who currently lack primary care physicians for themselves or their families.) He saw me one last time, and with another back slap and a handshake, my now-former doctor wished me well.\n\n【17】Yet I have balked for more than a year at contacting any of the physicians he recommended or anyone else I know, even as I increasingly fret about what I will do when the next medical crisis flares, as it inevitably will. I struggle with feeling simultaneously irritated with and sympathetic to the needs of a colleague who was providing something as basic as my health care. I do not enjoy second-guessing my motives. Why would I deliberately choose to add to a peer's burden by asking him or her to see me? Why would I expect him or her to be any less overbooked than my former doctor was, or I am? What if he or she assumes my care at some personal sacrifice and I am once again interfering with a frazzled physician's effort to achieve wellness? Why am I feeling snotty and entitled about not wanting to give myself over to a freshly minted doctor? Am I hopelessly old-fashioned in believing that physicians and patients are not interchangeable cogs in a well-oiled health care machine? Should efficiency always win the day? There is always the emergency department, I suppose.\n\n【18】On further reflection, I have come to recognize that contemporary health care models with their emphasis on screening and prevention may offer better care than the comforting but gauzily anachronistic way I experienced my relationship with my former doctor, his avuncular style seemingly more suited to a Norman Rockwell portrait of a venerable country physician than the modern health care scene. What I know, alas, is not what I feel, but I imagine I will get used to it.\n\n【19】If I am truthful with myself, my reluctance to engage a replacement doctor has not actually been about my fears of becoming a burden at all. Fifteen years was a long time together. Illicit or not, we had a significant, meaningful, and not easily replaced collaboration that mattered to me and—I am certain—to him. With the divorce so recent, I have hesitated to jump into a new relationship so quickly. I find it especially unnerving to embark on a remarriage to someone ignorant of my physical and mental foibles, whose intimacy with me and my body will rival only that that I share with my spouse.\n\n【20】To be brutally honest, however, once dumped, I am terrified I will be dumped again.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The PPIs are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the management of a variety of gastrointestinal disorders including symptomatic peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and nonulcer dyspepsia as well as for prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving antiplatelet therapy. PPIs inhibit gastric acid secretion, and the most commonly associated adverse effects include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and headache. Although PPIs have had an encouraging safety profile, recent studies regarding the long-term use of PPI medications have noted potential adverse effects, including risk of fractures, pneumonia, _Clostridium difficile_ diarrhea, hypomagnesemia, vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency, chronic kidney disease, and dementia. These emerging data have led to subsequent investigations to assess these potential risks in patients receiving long-term PPI therapy. However, most of the published evidence is inadequate to establish a definite association between PPI use and the risk for development of serious adverse effects. Hence, when clinically indicated, PPIs can be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for symptom control.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AKI ( acute kidney injury ), BMD ( bone mineral density ), CAP ( community-acquired pneumonia ), CDI ( Clostridium difficile infection ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), NSAID ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ), OR ( odds ratio ), PPI ( proton pump inhibitor ), RDA ( Recommended Dietary Allowance ), RR ( relative risk ), SIBO ( small-intestine bacterial overgrowth )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Accreditation Statement:** In support of improving patient care, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science is jointly accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), and the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) to provide continuing education for the healthcare team.\n\n【6】**Credit Statements:**\n\n【7】**AMA:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)_ .™ Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【8】**MOC:** Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC point in the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

Over the past several decades, PPIs have become one of the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States with use in nonhospitalized patients doubling between 1999 and 2012 and accounting for more than $11 billion in expenditures annually.\n\n【12】Currently, long-term PPI use is approved for prevention and symptom control of gastroesophageal reflux disease, for Barrett esophagus, as prophylaxis for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)–associated bleeding, and for pathologic hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome . Recent studies, however, have suggested an association between PPI use and several adverse effects. These studies have been well publicized and have been a source of major concern to both patients and physicians. The majority of results were reported from retrospective, observational studies with accepted statistical methods, which revealed mild to moderate overall associations but did not prove cause and effect. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to analyze recently published literature regarding several of the emerging concerns related to long-term use of PPIs and to determine whether the adverse effects mandate changes to our current practices .\n\n【13】Table 1 FDA-Approved Indications for Proton Pump Inhibitor Therapy\n\n| Treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease |\n| --- |\n| Healing of erosive esophagitis |\n| Maintenance treatment for healed erosive esophagitis |\n| Treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers |\n| Treatment and prophylaxis for NSAID-induced ulcers |\n| Treatment of _Helicobacter pylori_ infection in combination with antibiotics |\n| Management of pathologic hypersecretory conditions (including Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) |\n\n【15】Table 2 Risks Associated With Long-term Proton Pump Inhibitor Use\n\n| Adverse effect | Relative risk/odds ratio (95% CI) | Quality of evidence | Practice recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Likely causative | Likely causative | Likely causative | Likely causative |\n\n| Duodenal/jejunal aspirate | 7.59 (1.81-31.89) | Low | Unclear clinical importance |\n| Glucose hydrogen breath test | 1.93 (0.69-5.42) |  | No recommendation to check for SIBO while using PPIs |\n| Association unclear | Association unclear | Association unclear | Association unclear |\n\n| Unlikely causative | Unlikely causative | Unlikely causative | Unlikely causative |\n\n【19】BMD = bone mineral density; CBC = complete blood cell count; PPI = proton pump inhibitor; RDA = Recommended Dietary Allowance; SIBO = small intestine bacterial overgrowth.\n\n【20】Association Likely Causative\n----------------------------\n\n【21】### Hypomagnesemia\n\n【22】Hypomagnesemia associated with PPI use was first described in 2006 in patients who had been taking PPIs for more than 1 year and presented with carpopedal spasm.\n\n【23】Moreover, serum magnesium levels normalized with discontinuation of PPI therapy. Impaired absorption of magnesium may contribute to the development of hypomagnesemia. A meta-analysis of 9 observational studies and 109,798 patients reported a 43% increased risk of hypomagnesemia in patients receiving PPIs, thus suggesting a causative association.\n\n【24】Proton pump inhibitors linked to hypomagnesemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.\n\n【25】In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety warning regarding the association between PPI use and hypomagnesemia and recommended monitoring of magnesium levels in patients receiving long-term PPI therapy. Some guidelines suggest monitoring patients, particularly those concomitantly using diuretics or those with malabsorption disorders, because PPIs appear to be causative in this relationship.\n\n【26】### Vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> Deficiency\n\n【27】Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey have revealed low serum vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> levels in 3.2% of adults.\n\n【28】Gastric acid is required for the release of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> from dietary proteins to facilitate absorption in the terminal ileum. In a study performed at Kaiser Permanente, 25,956 patients with vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency were compared with 184,199 patients without vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency to assess the association with acid suppression therapy. Those who had received PPI treatment for more than 2 years had a 65% increased risk for vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency when compared with nonusers. Use of 1½ or more pills per day was also significantly associated with vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 1.95; 95% CI, 1.77-2.15).\n\n【29】Of note, this increased relative risk (RR) of B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency would increase the prevalence of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency in this population (≥50 years) from 2.3% to 3.8%. Current guidelines do not recommend monitoring vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> levels in patients receiving long-term PPI treatment.\n\n【30】### Small Intestine Bacterial Overgrowth\n\n【31】Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) has been associated with PPI use. Decreased gastric acid production associated with PPI use can lead to overgrowth of small-intestine bacteria. A meta-analysis of 11 studies found an increased risk for development of SIBO among PPI users compared with nonusers (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.24-4.21). This risk was 7.5-times greater among studies that utilized the more sensitive and specific duodenal/jejunal aspirate for diagnosis of SIBO. Studies using the glucose hydrogen breath test for diagnosis, a less sensitive and less specific technique, did not find this relationship.\n\n【32】We suspect that this association is likely causative, although the clinical importance of SIBO remains controversial.\n\n【33】Association Unclear\n-------------------\n\n【34】### Bone Fractures\n\n【35】Osteoporosis-related fractures are a major health concern associated with significant morbidity and mortality: the lifetime risk is approximately 40% to 50% and 13% to 22% for females and males, respectively.\n\n【36】Based on data from observational studies, concern has grown over the potential association between long-term use of PPIs and fracture risk. In 2010, the FDA published a warning of the increased risk of PPI use and fractures of the spine, wrist, and hip.\n\n【37】Multiple studies have found an increased risk of bone fractures in PPI users. A recent meta-analysis of 18 observational studies revealed that PPI use was associated with a 33% increased risk for fracture at any site (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.15-1.54), a 26% higher risk of hip fracture (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.16-1.36), and a 58% increase in risk of spine fracture (RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.38-1.82). After limiting analysis to cohort studies, and thus eliminating heterogeneity, the risk of hip fracture was still moderately increased by 24%. Subgroup analysis, interestingly, found that both short-term (<1 year) and long-term use were associated with increased risk of hip fracture.\n\n【38】The proposed mechanism for the increased fracture risk in patients receiving PPI therapy is reduced calcium absorption resulting in decreased bone mineral density (BMD). A placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial in elderly postmenopausal women found that calcium carbonate absorption in the fasting state decreased after 1 week of omeprazole therapy.\n\n【39】However, there is no clear evidence that PPI medications are associated with development of osteoporosis. The most thorough study assessed the relationship between PPI use and BMD of the lumbar spine (vertebrae L1-L4), femoral neck, and total hip at baseline and after 5 years and 10 years of PPI use.\n\n【40】CaMos Research Group  \nThe relationship between proton pump inhibitor use and longitudinal change in bone mineral density: a population-based study \\[corrected\\] from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos).\n\n【41】A total of 8340 patients underwent initial BMD measurements, and 4512 patients completed BMD testing after 10 years. After adjusting for confounders, the results revealed that BMD was significantly lower at the total hip and femoral neck regions but not at the lumbar spine among individuals using PPIs at baseline. After regression analyses, among those patients receiving continuous PPI therapy, there was no significant rate of change in BMD at the previously described measurement sites over 5- and 10-year periods. Similar to other studies, PPI users had significantly higher fracture rates compared with nonusers at baseline, but this finding was likely impacted by having statistically lower overall BMD as well as risk factors that predispose to fracture, including older age, female sex, and concurrent use of medications including corticosteroids. Finally, the association of short-term PPI use with fractures similarly suggests that PPI-induced osteoporosis is not likely the cause of PPI-associated bone fractures.\n\n【42】Another hypothesized mechanism is the inhibition of osteoclastic activity by PPIs, which affect bone remodeling and structure. A study of 104 patients (52 PPI users for ≥5 years and 52 nonusers) found no significant differences between the 2 populations in mean T scores of the femoral neck, trochanter, total hip, and L1 through L4 vertebrae or in overall BMD, cortical or trabecular BMD, and cortical thickness, therefore concluding that long-term use of PPIs was not associated with adverse changes to bone structure.\n\n【43】Additionally, the relationship between PPI use and risk of fracture among 79,899 postmenopausal women differed only by smoking history; while current and former smokers had a 50% increased risk of fracture, there was no significant increase in fracture risk among nonsmokers who used PPIs.\n\n【44】Although these studies have linked PPI use to development of hip fractures, recent data have been inconsistent and suggest that although there may be a mild to moderate increase in the overall risk of fractures regardless of duration of therapy, long-term PPI use does not significantly affect the rate of bone density loss. However, clinicians should be aware of the potential for association with fracture risk, although the American Gastroenterological Association does not recommend routine BMD screening or increased calcium supplementation in patients receiving long-term PPI therapy.\n\n【45】### _Clostridium difficile_ Infection\n\n【46】_Clostridium difficile_ is a common cause of diarrhea associated with increasing morbidity and mortality. Studies have suggested a link between use of PPIs and development of _C difficile_ infection (CDI), which led the FDA to issue a warning regarding risk of CDI in patients receiving PPI therapy and also recommend use of the lowest PPI dose for the shortest duration. A meta-analysis of 42 observational studies revealed an increased risk of both incident and recurrent CDIs in patients treated with PPIs (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.47-2.85 and OR, 2.51; 95% CI, 1.16-5.44, respectively).\n\n【47】Although presenting less overall risk, the use of histamine 2 receptor antagonists was also associated with an increased risk for CDI, thus suggesting an overall role of acid suppression in development of CDI. All studies included were nonrandomized observational studies, had significant statistical heterogeneity, and were variable with regard to dose and duration of PPI treatment.\n\n【48】The association between CDI and PPI use is hypothesized to be due to survival of the _C difficile_ vegetative form in the alkaline gastric pH. The emergence of SIBO in PPI users increases the luminal concentration of unconjugated bile acids, which may lead to conversion of the _C difficile_ spores to the toxin-secreting vegetative form. Additionally, after 4 to 8 weeks of PPI therapy, there are alterations in the gut microbiome that predispose patients to development of CDI.\n\n【49】Proton pump inhibitors alter specific taxa in the human gastrointestinal microbiome: a crossover trial.\n\n【50】A review of 23 observational studies with 288,620 patients found a 65% increase in CDI incidence among patients receiving PPIs.\n\n【51】An association between PPI use and CDI recurrence has also been reported.\n\n【52】However, studies with additional multivariate analysis established that PPI use was not associated with an increase in severe, complicated CDI, treatment failure, or recurrence of CDI.\n\n【53】Hence, the association between PPI use and CDI has been inconsistent, suggesting an association without clear causation.\n\n【54】### Acute and Chronic Kidney Disease\n\n【55】Reports have raised concerns regarding an association between use of PPIs and both acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, 10,482 participants with normal baseline renal function were followed up for a median of 13.9 years.\n\n【56】Proton pump inhibitor use and the risk of chronic kidney disease.\n\n【57】After adjusted analysis, the results revealed that PPI users had a 50% greater risk of development of CKD than nonusers, with a 10-year absolute risk increase of 3.3%. There was also a 64% increased risk of AKI among PPI users. These findings were replicated in a cohort of 248,751 patients from the Geisinger Health System who were followed up for a median of 6.2 years, during which there was a 17% increased risk of CKD among PPI users and higher risk with twice-daily dosing of PPIs when compared with a single daily dose.\n\n【58】Proton pump inhibitor use and the risk of chronic kidney disease.\n\n【59】However, among this population, there was a statistically significant increase in concomitant use of NSAIDs among PPI users, which is a confounding variable. The strengths of this study were inclusion of adjusted multivariate analysis and comparison between PPI users with propensity score–matched nonusers. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs national databases, Xie et al also assessed renal outcomes among a cohort of 173,321 new PPI users vs 20,270 new users of histamine 2 receptor antagonists followed up for a period of 5 years. In comparison with patients using histamine 2 receptor antagonists, PPI users had a 28% increased risk for incident CKD, as well as increased risk for estimated glomerular filtration rate decline greater than 30%, doubling of serum creatinine level, and development of end-stage renal disease.\n\n【60】There was also a significant association between duration of exposure and worsening outcomes. Another population-based study of 290,592 patients older than 65 years found a 2.5-times increased risk for development of AKI and a 3-times increased risk for acute interstitial nephritis among elderly patients recently beginning PPI therapy.\n\n【61】Proton pump inhibitors and the risk of acute kidney injury in older patients: a population-based cohort study.\n\n【62】Similarly, in a recent retrospective population study from Sweden, the risk of doubling of the serum creatinine level was 1.26-times greater after initiating PPI therapy compared with histamine 2 receptor antagonist therapy over a median follow-up of 2.7 years.\n\n【63】Association between proton pump inhibitor use and risk of progression of chronic kidney disease.\n\n【64】The mechanism for development of CKD may be the result of subclinical acute interstitial nephritis, which if untreated progresses to injury of the nephron. Based on the results of these studies, initiation and cumulative use of PPIs have been associated with risk for kidney disease. No recommendations have been proposed for monitoring kidney function in patients receiving long-term PPI therapy, irrespective of dose. We believe that until this association is better clarified, it is reasonable to monitor estimated glomerular filtration rate annually, based on CKD guidelines for monitoring patients taking potentially nephrotoxic medications.\n\n【65】### Dementia\n\n【66】Recent observational studies have suggested an increased risk of dementia among PPI users. Two prospective studies have assessed the association between PPI use and the risk of dementia. Haenisch et al\n\n【67】Risk of dementia in elderly patients with the use of proton pump inhibitors.\n\n【68】studied 3076 patients 75 years or older with no history of dementia and after adjusting for confounders, found that PPI users had a 38% increased risk of dementia and a 44% increased risk of Alzheimer disease. Gomm et al\n\n【69】Association of proton pump inhibitors with risk of dementia: a pharmacoepidemiological claims data analysis.\n\n【70】similarly conducted a prospective cohort study of 73,679 individuals 75 years or older without dementia at baseline and also found a significant 44% increased risk of dementia among patients receiving regular PPI medication. These findings contrast those of a recent prospective analysis of 13,864 middle-aged and older women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study II, in which there was no definite evidence of association between the duration of PPI use and cognitive function.\n\n【71】Association between proton pump inhibitor use and cognitive function in women.\n\n【72】Data from the Finnish nationwide health care registry also reported that among 70,718 newly diagnosed cases of Alzheimer disease, PPI use was not associated with increased risk.\n\n【73】Accumulation of amyloid-β peptides is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, and studies have found that lansoprazole led to higher levels of amyloid-β levels in the brains of mice.\n\n【74】The proton-pump inhibitor lansoprazole enhances amyloid beta production.\n\n【75】The PPIs increase amyloid synthesis and decrease amyloid degradation in the brain. In addition, association of PPI use with vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency can lead to neurologic symptoms including dementia. Thus, prospective clinical trials are required to further examine and establish this causal association.\n\n【76】Association Unlikely Causative\n------------------------------\n\n【77】Several studies have reported an association between PPI use and development of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).\n\n【78】A meta-analysis of 8 observational studies found that the overall risk of pneumonia was increased by 27% with use of PPIs.\n\n【79】There was a temporal relationship of pneumonia with recent initiation of PPI treatment (≤7 days of index date). This temporal relationship would support a confounding rather than causative association between PPI use and CAP. Further subgroup analyses revealed that higher doses were correlated with greater risk of development of pneumonia and that this risk decreased with longer duration of therapy before the index date of diagnosis. To address the limitations of prior studies and examine the risk between PPIs and CAP, a meta-analysis of 8 cohort studies was conducted in patients initiating prophylactic PPIs while using NSAIDs. Results revealed that PPIs were not associated with increased risk of hospitalization for CAP in the 6 months immediately following initiation of NSAID therapy (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.89-1.25).\n\n【80】CNODES Investigators  \nProton pump inhibitors and the risk of hospitalisation for community-acquired pneumonia: replicated cohort studies with meta-analysis.\n\n【81】A recently published observational cohort study noted an increased risk of mortality with PPI use. However, this study had major limitations including the potential for residual confounders accounting for this association, selection bias, and limited generalizability of results.\n\n【82】Although we should not ignore these epidemiological associations, prospective controlled studies are needed in the future to establish a causative relationship between PPIs and the aforementioned diseases.\n\n【83】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【84】Use of PPIs has been reported to be associated with increased risk for development of a multitude of adverse effects. The majority of the data are based on results from retrospective observational studies, which have inherent biases, risk for confounding variables, and the inability to demonstrate a definite causal relationship. Most of these studies reported mild to moderate overall associations (with RRs of 1 to 2) between PPI use and the risks of bone fracture, CDI, pneumonia, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, kidney disease, and dementia. Thus, because many of these adverse effects are uncommon, the absolute risk to patients remains quite small.\n\n【85】Based on current recommendations, the American Gastroenterological Association does not recommend routine laboratory monitoring or use of supplemental calcium, vitamin B12, and magnesium in patients taking PPIs daily. However, as this story evolves, our current practice is to check creatinine levels yearly, complete blood cell counts every other year, and vitamin B12 levels every 5 years in patients receiving long-term PPI therapy. In summary, the best strategy is to prescribe PPIs at the lowest dose on a short-term basis when appropriately indicated so that the potential benefits outweigh any adverse effects associated with the use of PPIs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The 12-lead electrocardiogram was monitored continuously, and heart rate, QT, and corrected QT interval (QTc) were measured during each study stage.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】There was no significant difference in resting heart rate or chronotropic response to epinephrine between LQTS patients and controls. The mean ± SD baseline QTc was greater in LQTS patients (500±68 ms) than in controls (436±19 ms, P<.001). However, 9 (47%) of 19 KVLQT1-genotyped LQT1 patients had a nondiagnostic resting QTc (<460 milliseconds), whereas 11 (41%) of 27 controls had a resting QTc higher than 440 milliseconds. During epinephrine infusion, every LQT1 patient manifested prolongation of the QT interval (paradoxical response), whereas healthy controls and patients with either LQT2 or LQT3 tended to have shortened QT intervals (P<.001). The maximum mean ± SD change in QT (A QT \\[epinephrine QT minus baseline QT\\]) was −5±47 ms (controls), +94±31 ms (LQT1), and −87±67 ms (LQT2 and LQT3 patients). Of 27 controls, 6 had lengthening of their QT intervals (A QT >30 milliseconds) during high-dose epinephrine. Low-dose epinephrine (0.05 μg • kg <sup>−1 </sup> • min <sup>−1 </sup> ) completely discriminated LQT1 patients (?QT, +82±34 ms) from controls (?QT, −7±13 ms; P<.001). Epinephrine- triggered nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurred in 2 patients with LQTS and in 1 control.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Epinephrine-induced prolongation of the QT interval appears pathognomonic for LQT1. Low- dose epinephrine infusion distinguishes controls from patients with concealed LQT1 manifesting an equivocal QTc at rest. Thus, epinephrine provocation may help unmask some patients with concealed LQTS and strategically direct molecular genetic testing.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】ECG ( electrocardiogram ), LQTS ( long QT syndrome ), NSVT ( nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ), PVCs ( premature ventricular contractions ), QTc ( corrected QT interval ), TWA ( T-wave alternans )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Mortality was ascertained from death certificates. Data were collected from January 1, 1994, through March 31, 2011.

{"seq_id": "3d59911f-1da2-4628-abbe-8e493c7db7a3", "title": "Hartmut Michel—Nobel Laureate in Chemistry", "text": "【0】Hartmut Michel—Nobel Laureate in Chemistry\nThe 1988 Nobel Prize in chemistry was awarded to 3 German biochemists, Hartmut Michel (1948-), Johann Deisenhofer (1943-), and Robert Huber (1937-), for their determination of the structure of certain proteins that are essential to photosynthesis. Michel performed the work that was the basis for the 3 scientists’ joint research. They wanted to determine the 3-dimensional structure of the photosynthetic reaction center, a 4-protein complex, that is crucial to the process of photosynthesis in certain bacteria. The bacterial species that Michel selected to investigate was _Rhodopseudomonas viridis_ . After 4 years (1978 to 1982) of experimentation, he was able to reduce the protein complex to a pure crystalline form, thus making it possible to determine the protein structure atom-by-atom with x-ray diffraction technique. For 2 years (1982 to 1984), the 3 scientists mapped the protein complex structure using x-ray crystallography. Deisenhofer received the Nobel Prize “for his part in work that revealed the 3-dimensional structure of closely linked proteins that are essential to photosynthesis,” and Huber received his share for using x-ray crystallography to elucidate the positions of the approximately 10,000 atoms in the protein complex. This work was significant not only to the understanding of photosynthesis but also for its applications; membrane-bound proteins are important in many disease states.\n\n【1】Michel was born on July 18, 1948, in Ludwigsburg in southwestern Germany, near Stuttgart. He studied biochemistry at the University of Tübingen and received a PhD degree in chemistry from the University of Würzburg in 1977.

Several factors complicate this association, including varied types of ischemic visual events ranging from transient monocular visual loss to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy and retinal artery occlusion (branch or central); additionally, diagnostic and therapeutic options for cerebral ischemia continue to advance.\n\n【1】Earlier reports highlighted a more benign prognosis after transient monocular visual loss, perhaps most clearly vocalized by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial study in which patients with transient monocular visual loss had a stroke risk approximately half the rate after a hemispheric transient ischemic attack.\n\n【2】This result may seem counterintuitive to the school of thought that regards ocular structures as a component of cerebral tissue. However, there are several potential reasons for this apparent paradox, including the possibility of misclassification of nonischemic transient visual loss as an ischemic event or a more benign local mechanism accounting for transient visual symptoms such as retinal vasospasm.\n\n【3】Retinal artery occlusion represents a more precisely defined diagnosis, thereby affording less diagnostic uncertainty and, accordingly, reducing the risks of misdiagnosis and misclassification. Such diagnostic precision regarding central retinal artery occlusion is a substantial strength when central retinal artery occlusion is used to study the relationship between retinal and subsequent brain ischemia because this investigative approach improves the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data. Previous studies document a gradient of increased risk concerning concomitant magnetic resonance imaging–demonstrable diffusion-weighted imaging abnormalities from transient monocular visual loss to branch retinal artery occlusion to central retinal artery occlusion.\n\n【4】Reports using insurance-generated data suggest approximately a 3% and 5% stroke risk at 2 and 4 weeks, respectively, after central retinal artery occlusion.\n\n【5】Risk and risk periods for stroke and acute myocardial infarction in patients with central retinal artery occlusion.\n\n【6】Retinal artery occlusion and the 3-year risk of stroke in Taiwan: a nationwide population-based study.\n\n【7】It is on this evolving background that Chodnicki et al review the recent Mayo Clinic experience with central retinal artery occlusion and the risk of associated cerebral ischemia. Although subject to limitations inherent to the retrospective methodology, including nonuniform patient evaluations, this excellent study has numerous strengths including sample size and case ascertainment. Overall, these authors noted a 5% risk of symptomatic ischemic stroke in 15 days before and after a central retinal artery occlusion. An embolic source for retinal ischemia was associated with a higher risk of cerebral ischemia. It should be noted, however, that the subpopulation with an embolic source for retinal ischemia was enriched primarily by participants with ipsilateral carotid stenosis, and such subjects are at a relatively increased risk of cerebral ischemia.\n\n【8】Chodnicki et al have undertaken an important study that significantly contributes to the field in at least 2 major ways. First, this study provides firm and timely evidence attesting to the close connection between retinal and cerebral ischemia. Second, this study underscores the need for an emergent management strategy for patients presenting with retinal ischemia. Current guidelines emphasize an emergent management approach akin to a “stroke alert,” including the performance of appropriate laboratory and other diagnostic tests to identify vasculitis, thrombotic factors, and relevant cardiac disease, along with pertinent neuro-imaging (preferably magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion-weighted imaging) and vascular imaging studies.

Furthermore, the in-hospital and long-term outcomes of patients with PAD are substantially worse than the outcomes of patients without PAD. This study, which included 1397 patients with PAD, is one of the largest of its kind.\n\n【1】Identification of PAD serves several useful purposes. Singh et al show that PAD identifies a patient population at particular risk of ischemic complications in both the short term and long term. In-hospital mortality rates were 3 times higher in patients with PAD compared with those without PAD-an important observation by Singh et al. Rates of inhospital myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attack were also higher, whereas rates of procedural success were lower. Other studies in contemporary PCI literature have corroborated this elevated risk for patients with PAD.\n\n【2】Peripheral vascular disease and one-year mortality following percutaneous coronary revascularization.\n\n【3】Impact of symptomatic peripheral arterial disease on 1-year mortality in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions.\n\n【4】Despite the fact that PAD poses a specific hazard to patients undergoing PCI, it is encouraging that Singh et al found that results of PCI have improved in recent years. This is due in large part to routine coronary stenting and superior generations of stents that are easier to deploy. Advances in pharmacotherapy such as intravenous glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition and clopidogrel also have contributed to this improvement. Ongoing advances such as the incorporation of drug-eluting stents into routine practice will likely further improve the results obtained with PCI in patients with PAD, although this is unlikely to eliminate the gap between patients with and without PAD on end points such as death.\n\n【5】The rates of stroke as a complication of PCI were extremely low in this study; however, it is notable that the rate of stroke was twice as high in patients with PAD (0.6%), emphasizing again the need for special care during catheterization of patients with PAD. Use of smaller-diameter catheters and exchange length wires for all catheter exchanges may help minimize the embolic potential in patients with PAD. Also, patients with PAD who undergo PCI have a higher risk of bleeding complications. Singh et al report a risk of bleeding that is essentially doubled with PAD, with a transfusion rate of 11% vs 5.8%. Vascular access may be more complicated due to the presence of atherosclerosis and calcification in the artery being punctured. Potentially, improvements in adjunctive pharmacotherapy such as use of the direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin instead of heparin could minimize this bleeding hazard in patients with PAD.\n\n【6】More effective methods to provide hemostasis after arterial sheath removal also are being explored.\n\n【7】Singh et al are to be commended for the comprehensive definition of PAD used in their study, which includes disease of the cranial and extracranial arteries, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and lower extremity arterial disease. It is appropriate that cerebrovascular disease be included in this definition. Indeed, the patient with involvement of 1 arterial bed has a high likelihood of either symptomatic or asymptomatic involvement of another arterial bed, and this global approach to atherothrombosis is the direction in which the field is heading.\n\n【8】Several simple measures could be instituted to detect PAD in patients requiring catheterization . Blood pressure levels should be measured in both arms to screen for subclavian artery stenosis, a particular concern in patients who have or may later receive internal mammary artery bypass grafts. All pulses should be examined carefully, including listening for carotid, subclavian, and femoral artery bruits. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurements also would be useful to screen for PAD.\n\n【9】Relationship of high and low ankle brachial index to all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality: the Strong Heart Study.\n\n【10】Indeed, since blood pressure levels and pedal pulses are recorded routinely anyway, incorporation of ABI measurements would seem to be a natural step in the catheterization laboratory assessment as an extension of the physical examination.\n\n【11】Lower extremity peripheral arterial disease in hospitalized patients with coronary artery disease.\n\n【12】Of course, a normal resting ABI would not rule out PAD; an exercise ABI should be obtained if claudication is clinically suspected. However, for PAD screening, a resting ABI would be a good start. In patients with hypertension and/or renal insufficiency, renal artery stenosis (RAS) should be considered a possible contributory factor, with perhaps noninvasive or invasive screening. In a catheterization laboratory setting, angiography may be an expedient screen for RAS. As suggested by prior work from the Mayo Clinic, RAS is highly prevalent among patients undergoing coronary angiography, particularly in those with hypertension, and screening abdominal angiography should be considered.\n\n【13】Incidental renal artery stenosis among a prospective cohort of hypertensive patients undergoing coronary angiography.\n\n【14】Other groups have confirmed these observations regarding the prevalence of previously undiagnosed RAS in the catheterization laboratory, with a potential benefit of percutaneous revascularization.\n\n【15】Prevalence of renal artery stenosis requiring revascularization in patients initially referred for coronary angiography.\n\n【16】FIGURE 1 Algorithm for identifying peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in patients with coronary artery disease serious enough to warrant percutaneous (or surgical) revascularization. A history and physical examination geared toward identifying PAD should be performed. On the basis of this information and the level of overall patient risk factors, various noninvasive screening tests and, when appropriate, angiographic assessment should be considered.\n\n【17】Patients with PAD should be targeted for more aggressive medical therapy. As observed by Singh et al, patients with PAD were much more likely to have diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and renal dysfunction and to use tobacco. This multiplicity of risk factors likely contributes to some portion of the excess risk of patients with PAD. Of course, lifestyle modification, including tobacco cessation, an improved diet, and regular exercise with incorporation of a walking program, is critical. Antiplatelet therapy is particularly important for patients with PAD.\n\n【18】Likewise, statin therapy is of proven benefit in reducing cardiac events and may even have a role in improving claudication.\n\n【19】Statin use and leg functioning in patients with and without lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease.\n\n【20】Effects of simvastatin on walking performance and symptoms of intermittent claudication in hypercholesterolemic patients with peripheral vascular disease.\n\n【21】Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is of great benefit, both in symptomatic and asymptomatic PAD.\n\n【22】Impact of ramipril in patients with evidence of clinical or subclinical peripheral arterial disease.\n\n【23】In the future, therapy to increase high-density lipoprotein levels likely will play a prominent role in PAD. Although the argument could be made that all these forms of medical therapy would be indicated on the basis of coronary artery disease, the presence of concomitant PAD should lead to intensification of the medical regimen. Paradoxically, patients with PAD appear to receive less aggressive medical therapy; apparently, both patients and physicians underestimate the importance of PAD.\n\n【24】Knowledge and attitudes regarding cardiovascular disease risk and prevention in patients with coronary or peripheral arterial disease.\n\n【25】Prior peripheral arterial disease and cerebrovascular disease are independent predictors of adverse outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes: are we doing enough? results from the Orbofiban in Patients with Unstable Coronary Syndromes-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (OPUS-TIMI) 16 study.\n\n【26】Atherosclerotic risk factor reduction in peripheral arterial diseasea: results of a national physician survey.\n\n【27】Missed opportunities to treat atherosclerosis in patients undergoing peripheral vascular interventions: insights from the University of Michigan Peripheral Vascular Disease Quality Improvement Initiative (PVD-QI2).\n\n【28】Peripheral arterial disease detection, awareness, and treatment in primary care.\n\n【29】Identification of PAD, beyond its role as a risk factor for cardiac disease, gives physicians an opportunity to determine whether a patient has claudication.

Often, a functional impairment is present with PAD, even if classic claudication is not. When claudication seems to limit a patient's ability to walk (and exercise), percutaneous revascularization should be considered. Contemporary data show excellent outcomes with lower extremity angioplasty and stenting.\n\n【32】Outcomes will likely be better as peripheral interventional technology, such as drug-eluting stents for PAD, improves.\n\n【33】Sirolimus-eluting stents for the treatment of obstructive superficial femoral artery disease: six-month results.\n\n【34】Physicians in general and cardiologists in particular need to pay more attention to PAD.

However, the issues he raised simply support the concerns that health information consumers, like me, have with industry-based research being published in peer-reviewed journals. Even 3 years after his employment with Merck, Hirsch still has the need to support his former employer's actions. Such loyalty is to be expected but confirms why industry-based research reports should be held suspect of reporting bias. Savvy health information consumers cannot turn a blind eye to who is sponsoring the research.\n\n【1】Affiliations and funding sources are important to report, and I appreciate that peer-reviewed journals expect such disclosure because these factors do play an important role in how the results and conclusions are weighed in the reader's mind. Why do pharmaceutical companies not produce their own publications to report the research they are performing?\n\n【2】I do not agree with Hirsch's contention that just because an article passed peer review it should be accepted. First, if a student passes an examination and is later found to have cheated, should the student not be punished for cheating? Second, I do not agree that authorship is an art. Those who did the work should be acknowledged as the authors. If a student hands in a paper that was written by someone else, should the student not be punished for cheating?\n\n【3】I doubt that tobacco and chemical companies will ever report that smoking and/or exposure to chemicals causes cancer. Similarly, we cannot expect that pharmaceutical companies will ever publish research showing their products to be ineffective; however, this has not stopped them from publishing research that supports their assertion that their product is no less than or just as effective as their competitor's products.\n\n【4】I understand Hirsch's point that professionals working in industry-based research may be held back in their professional careers, but that is the price one pays for higher salaries vs what academics give up for academic freedom. Of course, the blurring of the distinction among collaborating disciplines due to economic necessities raises issues that need to be resolved when such mixing results in ethical gray areas.\n\n【5】For example, I am concerned that many respected medical experts in their specialty areas who readily accept consulting positions with pharmaceutical companies do not think this would compromise their ability to be impartial in determining the optimal treatment if treatment involves their company's product. Additionally, I am troubled when I hear at medical conferences, even if spoken in jest, that statins should be added to drinking water because that would be easier than trying to convince people to eat healthier.\n\n【6】With the national hypertension and cholesterol guidelines in need of updating, I question whether there will be enough untainted experts to sit on the committees to update these guidelines. Just because the practice of pharmaceutical consulting is pervasive, it does not necessarily indicate that such practices are professionally ethical. I suggest at least a 10-year moratorium for any expert who would sit on these committees and severing all financial ties at least 2 years before volunteering for these committees through 5 years after the guidelines have been implemented.\n\n【7】Finally, many ethically compromising practices, such as guest and ghost authorships, should not be tolerated by the professions that value scientific research for what it should provide toward the advancement of medical knowledge—that the optimal treatment has been discovered through unbiased research.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Since that report, the research evidence has continued to mount related to the importance of physical activity (PA) as a key contributor to health and well-being. Updated physical activity guidelines have been published in many countries and by the World Health Organization. Unfortunately, despite the well-established evidence and public health messaging promoting PA, rates of participation have not improved, and physical inactivity remains a major risk factor for the development of most chronic diseases.\n\n【1】In this issue of the _Proceedings_ , Nauman et al\n\n【2】Association between personal activity intelligence and mortality: population-based China Kadoorie Biobank study.\n\n【3】provide additional evidence for the powerful impact that PA has in reducing mortality, in this case in a middle-income country. Data were analyzed from 443,492 healthy adults (30 to 79 years of age) in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. They used a tool (Physical Activity Intelligence \\[PAI\\]) that has the potential to be universally used to aid in tracking PA and as motivation for individuals to achieve healthy levels of PA. One of the principal features of PAI is that it specifically accounts for the intensity of PA. Individuals who achieve higher heart rates during PA throughout the day, relative to their age, sex, and resting heart rate, will have a higher PAI score.\n\n【4】A recently published cohort study of more than 400,000 adults from the National Health Interview Survey reported similar findings that vigorous-intensity PA is associated with lower all-cause mortality.\n\n【5】Both of these studies reported that their findings were consistent among sociodemographic characteristics, baseline chronic conditions, and presence of lifestyle risk factors, suggesting generalizability across multiple personal and social domains.\n\n【6】An extensive body of literature supports the cardiometabolic benefits achieved in performing higher intensity PA in short bouts. Evidence of the cardiometabolic benefits of higher intensity activity (improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness \\[VO <sub>2 </sub> max\\], body composition, blood glucose regulation, and resting blood pressure) is present in apparently healthy individuals and those with cardiometabolic diseases (specifically type 2 diabetes, heart failure, post–heart transplant, and cardiovascular disease).\n\n【7】In a practical sense, individuals could achieve this level of PA by performing a few activities each day at a vigorous intensity, for example, by purposefully doing an activity like stair climbing 3 times a day for about 5 minutes each time.\n\n【8】A key attribute of PAI that makes it potentially of universal use is that it can use most types of heart rate monitors that are available on many wrist-worn devices. In addition, it can sync to an app that is likewise available on most smart devices. Users get immediate feedback on their PAI score, which is updated daily and uses a 7-day rolling average. This monitoring provides feedback on activities in all domains (occupational, transportation, domestic, and recreational), which breaks the mold of the traditional exercise prescription model. Individuals can identify common tasks they perform (eg, house or yard work) or recreational activities, such as playing tennis or dancing, that may produce a higher PAI value.\n\n【9】Although many factors have been associated with inactivity, an individual’s perceived lack of time remains the primary barrier to performing sufficient PA. A clear benefit of high-intensity PA is that health benefits can be achieved in a shorter amount of time. Interestingly, the value-added benefits of high-intensity PA were recognized in the updated exercise statement for patients with type 2 diabetes. Specific recommendations included high-intensity strength training exercises and intervals or short bouts of aerobic exercise throughout the day.\n\n【10】Exercise/physical activity in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a consensus statement from the American College of Sports Medicine.\n\n【11】Whereas most modifiable cardiovascular disease risk factors are routinely discussed in clinical settings, including blood pressure, cholesterol level, weight, smoking, and blood glucose, PA is rarely assessed, despite a push from the American Heart Association advocating for the assessment of cardiorespiratory fitness as a vital sign.\n\n【12】Importance of assessing cardiorespiratory fitness in clinical practice: a case for fitness as a clinical vital sign: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n\n【13】Clinicians often cite time restraints, lack of financial reimbursement, poor health care system support, disbelief that PA counseling will make a difference, and scarcity of community resources as barriers to recommending PA. In addition, survey data suggest that there has been little or no improvement of health care provider–initiated PA assessment during the past decade, which is unacceptable, given the well-known benefits of PA and exercise.\n\n【14】How can busy health care providers overcome these significant barriers and improve patient care? First, they must prioritize assessment of PA at each visit along with other lifestyle modifications.\n\n【15】Attainable PA goals and exercise prescriptions should be discussed and reassessed at follow-up appointments. If PA goals are not met, patients should be encouraged to increase the duration or frequency of PA and be reminded that even light-intensity PA is associated with reductions in cardiovascular disease.\n\n【16】Wearable activity monitors have also become commonplace and serve as an excellent resource to gauge PA levels among patients. If time is a limitation, clinicians can use their allied health colleagues, including clinical exercise physiologists, nurses, physical therapists, nutritionists, and other fitness professionals, to engage in the assessment and promotion of PA. To better incentivize physicians, they can “bill for time,” which includes all aspects of the patient visit, including discussion on healthy lifestyle behaviors.\n\n【17】Health care providers should also educate themselves on local health and well-being centers in their communities, such as universities, community centers (eg, YMCA, park districts), and fitness centers, so that appropriate referrals can be made during clinic visits, additionally being prepared to suggest apps (such as the PAI app and others that offer multidomain lifestyle tracking, many for free) and online resources (for instance, exercise videos, including many with free interval training workout videos for children to seniors and for all fitness levels) specific to the patient’s exercise needs and goals.\n\n【18】Frankly, the time has come for clinicians to employ PA as a vital sign that is routinely assessed, as Sallis et al have previously suggested. Although statements, recommendations, and guidelines were developed only in the past 25 years, the evidence for the clinical relevance of PA has existed in the medical literature for a much longer time. The classic work by Morris et al\n\n【19】reported in the _Lancet_ in the 1950s demonstrated the protection from coronary artery disease by active workers (bus conductors and postmen) compared with their sedentary coworkers (bus drivers and telephonists). Now, in the current pandemic, data have shown that physical inactivity may increase the risk of both hospitalization and admission to intensive care units.\n\n【20】Physical inactivity is associated with a higher risk for severe COVID-19 outcomes: a study in 48 440 adult patients.\n\n【21】Once assessed, encouraging sufficient PA on a regular basis is one of the most important recommendations that can be made for all individuals to receive health benefits. The method used by Nauman et al\n\n【22】Association between personal activity intelligence and mortality: population-based China Kadoorie Biobank study.\n\n【23】has great potential as a universal tool in this effort to assess and to promote PA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The final diagnosis for the cause of dizziness was independently assigned by 2 neurologists, with a third neurologist resolving any disagreements. The primary outcome was a composite of ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, seizure, brain tumor, demyelinating disease, and CNS infection. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess the association between clinical variables and serious CNS causes of dizziness.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 907 patients experiencing dizziness (mean age, 59 years; 58% women \\[n=529\\]), 49 (5%) had a serious neurologic diagnosis, including 37 cerebrovascular events.

SARS-CoV-2 leads to an increase in nuclear factor kappaB, tumor necrosis factor α, and lymphocyte dysregulation. Smoking leads to an increased neutrophil count and can cause neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio elevation. Together, this can contribute to the development and worsening of outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\n【7】Fibrin deposition in pulmonary vasculature, which is increased in both COVID-19 and smoking, is thought to contribute to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome. Tissue factor, which initiates the extrinsic coagulation cascade, is highly expressed by alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells. Inflammatory cytokines and regulators, including tumor necrosis factor α and nuclear factor kappaB, upregulate tissue factor expression, leading to fibrin deposition, further inflammation, and microvascular permeability in the lungs.\n\n【8】Both SARS-CoV-2 and smoking upregulate this cytokine release and lead to an increased risk of coagulopathy.\n\n【9】ISTH interim guidance on recognition and management of coagulopathy in COVID-19.\n\n【10】Acute effects of cigarette smoking on platelet-dependent thrombin generation.\n\n【11】The upregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in smokers may predispose this population to an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) was defined as a diagnosis of myocardial infarction, stroke, or heart failure, and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) were defined as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or type 2 diabetes. Lifelong exercise patterns were measured over a median of 32 years for 405 patients with CVD, 1379 patients with CVRFs, and 10,656 controls. Participants were categorized into nonexercisers and quintiles (Q1–Q5) of exercise dose (metabolic equivalent task \\[MET\\] minutes per week).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The CVD/CVRF prevalence was lower for each exercise quintile compared with nonexercisers (CVD: nonexercisers, 9.6% vs Q1: 4.4%, Q2: 2.8%, Q3: 2.4%, Q4: 3.6%, Q5: 3.9%; _P_ <.001; CVRF: nonexercisers, 24.6% vs Q1: 13.8%, Q2: 10.2%, Q3: 9.0%, Q4: 9.4%, Q5: 12.0%; _P_ <.001).

As well-validated clinically useful scoring systems were first and subsequently published and adopted, 2001 saw the science of care regarding balancing stroke prevention vs bleeding risk of anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation take a substantial clinical leap forward.\n\n【2】The lack of specific literature is easily understood, given the complex real-world comorbidity-laden bidirectional risk CKD and atrial fibrillation impose, from both an etiologic and outcomes perspective. Understandably, these substantial confounding factors inherent in this population create challenges to study design and interpretation of the current literature.\n\n【3】Drs Dhaese and De Vries are to be commended for this work, which summarizes important clinical data highlighting the current literature of risk vs benefit in prevention of ischemic stroke for patients with CKD and atrial fibrillation; their review also summarizes the current state of the literature about vitamin K antagonism vs non–vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in patients with CKD. Clinicians are further benefited by useful tables highlighting interactions of and contraindications to NOACs and commonly used therapeutics for reversal strategies in patients suffering bleeding episodes treated with NOAC agents.\n\n【4】Highlighted as well is a proposed and helpful framework for decision-making in the use of anticoagulation for patients with CKD in atrial fibrillation. Whereas this proposed scoring system provides the first attempt at a pragmatic clinical tool to be used in this population, this scoring system is compromised by the lack of high-quality data driving its components. Particularly, this tool is confounded in the population with CKD stage 5 and atrial fibrillation.\n\n【5】Questions therefore remain unanswered about the true utility of anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation associated with advanced CKD. Although these are critical to answer with high-quality randomized trials, are these the only or correct questions we should be asking?\n\n【6】Understanding the potential consequences of initiation of vitamin K antagonists certainly raises important questions as well. Vascular calcification-associated vitamin K deficiency is recognized in the literature from organic causes of malignant disease, liver dysfunction, malnutrition, obesity, and inflammatory bowel disease as well as from deficiencies of vitamin K–dependent proteins Gla-rich protein/unique cartilage matrix-associated protein (GRP/Ucma), growth arrest–specific protein 6 (Gas6), and matrix Gla protein (GLA).\n\n【7】Carboxylated matrix Gla protein (GLA) is an important and potent inhibitor of vascular calcification. Its absence in animal models and documented genetic polymorphisms in humans show dramatic associations with vascular calcification and accelerated atherosclerosis.\n\n【8】Spontaneous calcification of arteries and cartilage in mice lacking matrix GLA protein.\n\n【9】Matrix gla protein gene polymorphism is associated with increased coronary artery calcification progression.\n\n【10】Relative Gla and vitamin K deficiency has been associated with the devastating condition of calciphylaxis as well.\n\n【11】Vitamin K–dependent carboxylation of matrix Gla protein influences the risk of calciphylaxis.\n\n【12】Thus, the critical biology of vascular calcification affected by vitamin K metabolism, which is in turn a cornerstone of traditional therapy, demands further understanding. Appropriate questions of the potential risks of vitamin K antagonism itself, which certainly may confound the efficacy equation of anticoagulation with these agents particularly in patients with CKD, need answering.\n\n【13】Along this line of reasoning, the authors reflect on the theoretical benefits of NOACs with respect to “off-target effects” of these agents. Cardiovascular protective effects are highlighted as potential benefits of NOACs seen in the cardiovascular literature in the article. Whether NOACs themselves are vascular protective agents beyond anticoagulation raises additional important questions.\n\n【14】Finally, the burgeoning conceptual framework of whether atrial fibrillation itself may be the result of an inflammatory condition is a fascinating construct that raises important questions from a diagnostic and therapeutic targeting.\n\n【15】The inflammasomes, of which at least 10 different types are now identified, are intracellular constructs that serve as both sensors and receptors of pathogens for the innate immune system. Their function is the amplification of anti-inflammatory and proinflammatory pathways providing protection from infection. Among these inflammasomes, NOD-like receptor (NLR) within the family pyrin domain–containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway has received the most attention and demonstrated association of development and maintenance of atrial fibrillation.\n\n【16】Importantly, the myriad metabolic and mechanical factors inducing abnormalities in flow and cardiac myocyte tissue stress associated with atrial fibrillation as well as inflammasome activation are potentially amplified and accompanied by advanced CKD.\n\n【17】Atrial fibrillation and the bidirectional impact of the pathophysiologic mechanism of advanced CKD should promote questions not only of how we manage risks of thromboembolism and traditional rate control but also of how we use novel diagnostic and advanced therapeutics for mitigation of cardiac inflammation. Finally, whether our traditional anticoagulation therapies provide true patient-centered benefit in this vulnerable population is the question we must answer, and soon.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

This is not due to physician immunity from the problem, because physicians have been shown to have addiction at a rate similar to or higher than that of the general population. Additionally, physicians' addictive disease (when compared with the general public) is typically advanced before identification and intervention. This delay in diagnosis relates to physicians' tendency to protect their workplace performance and image well beyond the time when their life outside of work has deteriorated and become chaotic. We provide an overview of the scope and risks of physician addiction, the challenges of recognition and intervention, the treatment of the addicted physician, the ethical and legal implications of an addicted physician returning to the workplace, and their monitored aftercare. It is critical that written policies for dealing with workplace addiction are in place at every employment venue and that they are followed to minimize risk of an adverse medical or legal outcome and to provide appropriate care to the addicted physician.\n\n【1】Approximately 10% to 12% of physicians will develop a substance use disorder during their careers, a rate similar to or exceeding that of the general population.\n\n【2】Prevalence of substance use among US physicians.\n\n【3】Although physicians' elevated social status brings many tangible and intangible rewards, it also has an isolating effect when they are confronted with a disease such as addiction, which has a social stigma. This isolation can lead to disastrous consequences, both in delaying the recognition of and in intervening in the disease process, as well as in the attendant risk of death by inadvertent overdose or suicide.\n\n【4】Further causes for delay in diagnosis include fear on the part of the physician that disclosure of an addictive illness might cause loss not only of prestige but also of his or her license to practice medicine and thus livelihood. Additionally, a physician's family members and coworkers will often participate in a “conspiracy of silence” in an effort to protect the family or practice workers from economic ruin by the loss of the physician's job and income.\n\n【5】McLellan et al conducted a 5-year longitudinal cohort study of 904 physicians, 87% of whom were male, who were enrolled in 16 state physician health programs (PHPs). Alcohol was the primary drug of abuse in 50.3%, opioids in 35.9%, stimulants in 7.9%, and other substances in 5.9%; 50% reported abuse of multiple substances, 13.9% a history of intravenous drug use, and 17% previous treatment for addiction. The authors found that certain specialties, such as anesthesiology, emergency medicine, and psychiatry, appeared to be overrepresented in these programs relative to their numerical representation in the national physician pool. Indeed, other investigators have suggested that these specialties seem to have a disproportionate propensity toward addiction.\n\n【6】Contributing factors may include stresses of the work, ready access to narcotics and other psychotropic drugs in the workplace, and perhaps a selection bias in the type of physicians who seek these specialties.\n\n【7】Physicians in different specialties tend to abuse different classes of drugs. For example, although alcohol is the drug of choice for most physicians with addiction, only about 10% of anesthesiologists enter treatment for alcohol addiction. Instead, the vast majority of addicted anesthesiologists are addicted to potent intravenous opioids such as fentanyl and sufentanil. Often, addicted physicians divert these drugs from the workplace, indeed from their individual patients, and losing their job would cut their lifeline to their drug of abuse. Thus, they preserve their work performance above all other aspects of their life, and by the time a physician's addictive illness becomes apparent in the workplace, the rest of his or her social, family, and personal life is in shambles.\n\n【8】For a colleague who suspects addiction in a peer, the challenges of conclusively identifying and intervening can be daunting and include everything from a concern of “What right do I have to tell them how to live their life?” to a fear of retaliatory litigation. Additionally, the medical licensing boards in many states have included the risk of sanctions if a physician becomes aware of an addictive disease in a colleague and fails to intervene or notify the board or the state's PHP. This aspect will be covered more fully in a later section.\n\n【9】WHAT IF PHYSICIAN ADDICTION IS SUSPECTED?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【10】The signs and symptoms of addictive illness range from very subtle to extremely overt . Although they might be as obvious as intoxication on duty, with the stereotypical signs of ataxia and dysarthria, the findings in general are far more subtle. Particularly with opioid addiction, the addicted physician may continue to function at ahigh level, and his or her colleagues have only a hint of a problem because of behavior changes. Although protecting the safety of our (and the addicted physician's) patients is of the utmost importance, the addicted physician who engages in parenteral opioid use has a very real risk of serious morbidity (eg, anoxic brain injury from inadvertent overdose) and death. Thus, rapid confirmation and intervention are necessary if physician addiction is suspected. Unfortunately, decisions must often be made in the face of inconclusive evidence of physician addiction or diversion of drugs for self-use. If an evaluation is delayed until evidence of physician addiction or diversion of drugs is secured “beyond a reasonable doubt,” the risk of a tragic outcome increases. As any intervention that requires an evaluation for chemical dependency does not consist of accusing the individual of a crime—reasonable suspicion of an addictive illness is sufficient.\n\n【11】In the Figure , we provide a generalized (and greatly oversimplified because it is impossible to include the myriad ways these situations might unfold) approach to a prototypic investigation, intervention, and follow-up of a physician suspected of substance abuse; however, it is essential that each health care organization, regardless of its size, has written policies in place specific to the state laws. Because laws for dealing with these issues vary from state to state, the admittedly simplistic algorithm in the Figure is not sufficiently specific to substitute for a formal written policy for all health care organizations. If organizations fail to formalize in writing their policies, they are at subsequent risk of adverse medical or legal outcomes.\n\n【12】TABLE 1 Signs and Symptoms of Addiction That Might Appear in the Workplace\n\n| _Possible signs suggestive of alcohol dependence_Alcohol on breathSlurred speechAtaxiaErratic performance or decrement in performanceTremulousness“Out-of-control” behavior at social eventsProblems with law enforcement (eg, domestic abuse, driving while intoxicated)Hidden bottlesPoor personal hygieneFailure to remember events, conversations, or commitments (“blackouts”)TardinessFrequent hangoversPoor early morning performanceUnexplained absencesUnusual traumatic injuriesMood swingsIrritabilitySweatingDomestic/marital problemsIsolationLeaving the workplace early on a regular basis_Possible signs suggestive of opiate dependence_Periods of agitation (withdrawal) alternating with calm (drug was just taken)Dilated pupils (opiate withdrawal)Pinpoint pupils (side effect of opiate)Excessive sweatingAddition of long sleeves (to hide needle tracks)Frequent bathroom breaks (to take another dose)Frequent unexplained absences during workdaySpending more hours at work than necessary (access source of drug)Volunteering for extra callVolunteering to provide extra breaks or refusing breaksVolunteering to clean operating roomsVolunteering to return waste drugs to pharmacyRummaging through sharps containersSloppy record keeping or discrepancies between charted dose and actual dose administeredExcessive narcotic use charted for patientsAssay of waste drug returned showing evidence of dilutionNever returning any waste at the end of a casePatients arriving in postsurgical recovery room with pain out of proportion to charted narcotic dose |\n| --- |\n\n【14】FIGURE. Generalized approach to a prototypic investigation, intervention, and follow-up of a physician suspected of abusing substances.\n\n【15】WHAT DOES INTERVENTION INVOLVE?\n-------------------------------\n\n【16】Although _intervention_ can have different meanings in different contexts, we define it as the initial confrontation with the suspected addict in an effort to coerce the individual to submit to a formal chemical dependency evaluation by experts. An intervention is one of life's most stressful events, for both the suspected addict and those intervening. It is not to be undertaken casually; rather, it requires preparation and logistical support.\n\n【17】Above all, the person intervening should never simply approach the suspected addict one-on-one and ask if he or she is addicted or diverting drugs or suggest that he or she stop using or diverting drugs. This strategy is not only pointless as denial is the hallmark of addictive illness, it is also potentially dangerous because the threat to the physician's status, autonomy, security, and financial stability may drive him or her to an act of desperation such as suicide.\n\n【18】In the setting of suspected acute intoxication in a physician who provides patient care or who might be reasonably expected to provide care in the near future (eg, while being “on-call” for emergency care), immediate removal from the practice setting is essential. In such cases, an intervention will include accompanying the suspected addicted physician to an established health care environment, such as the employee health clinic or emergency department, where immediate drug testing can be undertaken. If testing confirms acute intoxication, this portion of the intervention (ie, documentation of substance abuse) is now complete. Care of the physician who abuses drugs now involves taking him or her to a facility that has the means to evaluate for addiction. Faithful adherence to preexisting institutional policies is important. In a less urgent situation in which addiction is suspected in the absence of workplaceintoxication, it is critical that before intervention there is a plan for a chain-of-custody transfer of the suspected addict to the area where he or she will be evaluated, whether that is an employee health clinic, a state PHP, or directly to a chemical dependency expert. Most state PHPs will provide invaluable assistance with either conducting an effective intervention or providing a recommendation for referral to a third-party specializing in interventions.\n\n【19】Although it is beyond the scope of this article to provide a detailed manual on how best to perform a safe and effective intervention, in the past 20 years, theories of the timing of intervention have evolved from waiting until the addict has reached “rock bottom,” ie, the point of absolute despair and having lost everything meaningful in his or her life, to a model in which an intervention occurs earlier in the disease process. Using this confrontational approach, the addict is faced by a roomful of family members, coworkers, supervisors, etc, who offer specific evidence of the addictive behavior they have witnessed in an effort to rapidly break down the tendency of the addict to deny a problem. The addict is then immediately transferred to a chemical dependency treatment facility for detoxification, evaluation, and treatment. After any intervention, the addicted physician must never be simply sent home with instructions to check in for an evaluation at some later date because the risk of suicide is far too great (M.D.S. oral communication, March 4, 2009). The evaluation phase may last from several hours to several days and is often an inpatient process.\n\n【20】One frustration in the aftermath of such an intervention is that, due to confidentiality concerns, once the suspected addict is in evaluation or chemical dependency treatment, there is very little transfer of information back to the workplace regarding the accuracy of the diagnosis in question or a possible timetable for return to practice. This can prove problematic for those trying to fill the manpower gap left by the physician's absence from the workplace. Additionally, the medical evaluation of the physician can be inconclusive. In such cases, we recommend continued discreet observation of the physician for further worrisome behavior because even experts can be fooled by a well-crafted denial.\n\n【21】WHAT IS CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY “TREATMENT”?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【22】Evaluation of physicians with substance abuse disorders is difficult and requires a multidisciplinary team with experience working with this population.\n\n【23】The intellect that physicians rely on to learn their craft allows them to develop exceptional rationalization, denial, and resistance techniques. Thus, recognition of their disease is difficult.\n\n【24】During the initial evaluation, most physicians will deny having a problem. Although a detailed substance use history is essential to the diagnosis, it can be remarkably difficult to obtain. Therefore, collateral information from friends, family, coworkers, and pharmacies is required to gather documentation to support the diagnostic evaluation, and the evaluating program will typically require signed releases from the physician undergoing evaluation to obtain this vital information. The substance use evaluation seeks to determine whether addiction indeed exists and the extent of the problem. Both a complete medical history and a physical examination are necessary because addicted individuals have often neglected their health. A family evaluation gathers information about the individual's functioning and determines how the family has been affected. Co-occurring psychiatric illness (called a dual-diagnosis, ie, substance use disorder combined with a major depressive disorder, bipolar affective disorder, or anxiety or panic disorder) is common in the addicted physician and can undermine recovery from addiction\n\n【25】Risk factors for relapse in health care professionals with substance use disorders.\n\n【26】 thus, psychiatric and psychological evaluations are needed. Cognitive screening is required to rule out substantial impairment, which can be further assessed by complete neurocognitive testing. Substantial cognitive and memory impairments are often seen in the setting of alcohol and methamphetamine dependence.\n\n【27】After a diagnosis of addiction has been established, treatment should be initiated at a program that specializes in the care of addicted physicians. Detoxification is frequently needed to prevent withdrawal symptoms and to provide a safe transition to a drug-free state. The patient will be assigned to an addiction counselor and a physician. Most treatment-program curricula include individual and group psychotherapy, education about addiction, and the opportunity for fellowship to reestablish positive relationships with peers.\n\n【28】The primary focus of most treatment programs is complete abstinence from drugs and alcohol and is based around a 12-step program, as originally crafted for the Alcoholics Anonymous model. McLellan et al found that 95% of physicians underwent treatment on the basis of this model, with 78% entering a residential treatment program for a mean of 72 days (range, 30-90 days) and 22% entering directly into outpatient treatment. Addiction treatment is designed to help individuals recognize the extent that addiction has controlled their behavior and altered their lives. Initial treatment efforts help addicts break through denial, recognize those aspects of their lives that need attention and healing, and come to accept that they have a life- and career-threatening disease. An effort is made to provide them with the skills and resources needed to stay abstinent and address their other problems, which range from marital and family issues to loss of job or professional license.\n\n【29】Addiction treatment programs specializing in the care of physicians offer specific therapeutic modalities targeted at physicians. Group therapy for physicians, consisting of meetings with multiple addicted-physician peers, is a primary feature of these programs. These groups provide the opportunity for physicians to recognize their own maladaptive behaviors reflected in their peers and to discuss those issues unique to the health care workplace. This includes discussion of access to addicting medications, licensure, shame and guilt, return-to-work issues, and dealing with patients. This type of therapy requires a staff familiar with physicians and their work environment. A medical practice assessment is used to identify risks and problems in the workplace and to establish a treatment plan supportive ofabstinence. Such plans include recommendations for mutual help meetings (Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous), therapy, monitoring, and workplace limitations.\n\n【30】The treatment plans attempt to align the patients' goals with those of their employers, the state PHP, and other interested parties (eg, the Drug Enforcement Administration). Additionally, it is beneficial for those leaving treatment to connect with physicians already in recovery from addiction and to establish a recovering peer group in their local community.\n\n【31】SHOULD THE ADDICTED PHYSICIAN RETURN TO PRACTICE?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【32】Physicians have remarkable abstinence rates after completing an addiction/rehabilitation program compared with the general population. Abstinence rates are between 74% and 90%, similar to another professional group with higher than average success rates, airline pilots.\n\n【33】These high rates could be due to motivation to maintain licensure and to continue professional practice, as well as the extensive treatment and long-term monitoring that are required. However, there is also a disturbing rate of recidivism for addicted physicians. The Washington State PHP reviewed its experience with health care professionals during a 10-year period and found that 25% had at least 1 relapse and noted apparent contributing or confounding factors.\n\n【34】Risk factors for relapse in health care professionals with substance use disorders.\n\n【35】Relapse risk was increased by a family history of a substance use disorder and by a coexisting psychiatric illness (dual-diagnosis). Indeed, in the setting of opioid addiction, a coexisting psychiatric illness or a positive family history of addiction resulted in a significantly increased risk of relapse. The 3 factors, when combined in a single individual, resulted in a 13-fold increase in risk of relapse . Menk et al found that even 1 relapse can be catastrophic in the setting of addiction to potent opioids such as fentanyl, because 16% of the relapsed anesthesia residents were found dead before anyone suspected a relapse. Thus, addiction treatment and monitoring programs must account for these factors when treatment plans are being developed and when physicians are being counseled about returning to practice.\n\n【36】TABLE 2 Opioid Abuse with Coexisting Factors\n\n| History of major opioid abuse with | Relapse risk HR (95% CI) |\n| --- | --- |\n| No psychiatric illness | 0.85 (0.33–2.17) |\n| Coexisting psychiatric illness (dual-diagnosis) | 5.79 (2.89–11.42) |\n| Coexisting psychiatric illness and family history of substance abuse | 13.25 (5.22–33.59) |\n\n【38】CI = confidence interval; HR = hazard ratio.\n\n【39】Society and the individual's investment in physician training, as well as the high abstinence rates for addicted physicians who complete an appropriate treatment program, support a rehabilitation model, not a punitive stance. Shore revealed a high suicide rate associated with a punitive model in contrast to high recovery rates associated with a good monitoring system. Many physicians can successfully return to practice with a solid addiction recovery program and monitoring systems in place. Any physician returning to practice should engage in his or her state's PHP, and in general such participation is mandatory. These programs are usually led by physician advocates, and they provide resources for individual and group therapy, psychiatric care, mutual help meetings, body fluid monitoring for drugs of abuse, and workplace education and monitoring. Usually, PHPs require contracts with the physician that document expected activities and require compliance with the activities  most likely to ensure abstinence and successful return to practice. Failure to comply with the program required by the PHP will result in reporting to the state's medical licensing board, at which point there will typically be a disciplinary action taken with the possibility of public disclosure, sanctions up to and including license suspension, or, in extreme cases, revocation. The PHP will generally manage the logistics of obtaining and monitoring required drug screens, both random and for cause. Such testing both promotes abstinence and establishes a record of abstinence, although limits of such testing exist that can lead to both false-positive and false-negative test results. Often, limitations on physician prescribing are put in place to include opioids or other potentially addicting medications. Return to a group practice setting with the provision of on-site supervision by peers is considered optimal but typically is not mandatory (M.D.S. e-mail communication, March 30, 2009).\n\n【40】TABLE 3 Activities Required or Suggested by Physician Health Programs for Addicted Physicians\n\n| _Usually required by state physician health programs_Abstinence from all drugs of abuseGroup therapy with other physicians provided by a professional facilitator (weekly)Individual psychotherapy (weekly)Mutual help meetings, usually a 12-step program (multiple times per week)Monitoring meeting with state program (monthly)Drug screening, random and for cause (multiple per month)Workplace monitor to supervise return-to-work activities_Possible further requirements_Psychiatric carePrimary care physician (no self-prescribing or prescribing for family members, not even antibiotics)Family therapyWorkplace limitations (eg, no access to opioids or procedures with opioids)Prescribing limitations (eg, no prescribing of controlled substances)Work hours limitedNeurocognitive testingReturn to work evaluation, if disability requires several months' absence |\n| --- |\n\n【42】Anesthesiologists represent a special case, in that access to and use of highly addictive drugs are common in anesthesia practice. Furthermore, anesthesiologists who are addicted to anesthetic agents or anesthetic supplements (eg, opioids, propofol, volatile anesthetic agents) have a uniquely high relapse rate associated with an unacceptable risk of morbidity and mortality.\n\n【43】As such, it is often preferable to limit the future professional activities of these once-addicted anesthesiologists to nonclinical roles such as research, teaching, and administration or to direct them to a new practice specialty. Indeed, this high relapse rate in anesthesiologists, coupled with the substantial risk that the initial manifestation of relapse will be death, has led 2 of the authors (K.H.B. and M.D.S.) to suggest in a recent editorial that anesthesia caregivers who become addicted to anesthetic agents should not be allowed to return to the operating room environment.\n\n【44】LEGAL ASPECTS\n-------------\n\n【45】The legal aspects of addressing physician addiction can be thorny and complex. The first legal and ethical obligation of a clinic or hospital after discovery that a staff physician has an addiction is to safeguard patients by removing the physician from practice and counseling the physician to take a leave of absence for treatment. State laws vary on drug testing of employees.\n\n【46】Some states disallow drug and alcohol testing unless the employer has a written drug and alcohol testing policy in place that meets certain legal requirements. Some state laws restrict random testing and limit grounds for testing based on “reasonable suspicion.”\n\n【47】State medical licensing boards typically require physicians to self-report and to report on other physicians who are unable to practice medicine safely because of drug or alcohol use.\n\n【48】Most states have a bypass mechanism that allows foregoing of a report to the state licensing board and instead allows a report to the state's PHP to satisfy this requirement.\n\n【49】However, these bypass programs may have eligibility requirements that exclude certain physicians from participating and require a report to the medical board. Typical exclusions are for physicians who are already under licensing board discipline, those who previously have been terminated from a professional rehabilitation program, those who have diverted controlled substances for other than self-administration, or those whose continued practice of medicine would create a serious risk of harm to the public.\n\n【50】As long as the reported physician complies with the practice limitations and continuing care requirements of the rehabilitation program and abides by the requirements of the PHP, the physician engaged in a bypass program typically can avoid formal, public reprimand or disciplinary action by the licensing board. However, in California, such a bypass rehabilitation program has come under public attack for permitting impaired physicians to continue to practice and for not being effective in adequately protecting patients from substandard care.\n\n【51】Federal laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, and state civil rights laws\n\n【52】generally protect physicians actively engaged in chemical dependency treatment programs as well as recovering addicts. These laws generally require “reasonable accommodation” for the recovering alcoholic and drug addict, such as a modified work schedule. (However, the Americans with Disabilities Act specifically excludes as a covered disability “psychoactive substance abuse disorders resulting from current illegal use of drugs.” ) Furthermore, federal and state laws mandate job protection, typically up to 12 weeks, during a medical leave for addiction treatment.\n\n【53】When a physician returns to work after addiction treatment, employers and hospitals generally can impose restrictions on employment, as described in the previous section. Clinics and hospitals should spell out for the returning physician the consequences of a relapse or failure to comply with any of the return-to-work conditions.\n\n【54】Is an impaired or recovering physician required to disclose this status to patients as part of informed consent? State courts are split on this issue. For example, in 2000 the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that no cause of action existed against a physician for his failure to disclose his drug (cocaine) use to his patient before a surgical procedure and that this failure did not void the patient's informed consent to the procedure.\n\n【55】In contrast, a Louisiana appellate court ruled in 1991 that a surgeon's failure to disclose his alcohol abuse voided the patient's consent to a lumbar spine procedure.\n\n【56】The court reasoned that the alcohol abuse created a material risk relating to the physician's ability to perform the surgery, and if the physician had disclosed this information, the patient could have opted for another type of treatment.\n\n【57】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【58】Addictive disease is relatively common in the general population and in the physician population. Prompt recognition of addictive disease in a physician is difficult and yet critical because delay could result in morbidity or mortality not only in the addicted physician but also in his or her patients. It is vital that written policies and procedures are in place to assist in these highly emotionally charged situations, because they will promote a consistent and effective approach to promoting early recognition of a substance abuse problem, an effective intervention, and effective treatment and aftercare. Such policies can help prevent disastrous medical and legal outcomes for the affected physician, for his or her colleagues or employer, and for the physician's patients. Each state's PHP can serve as a valuable source of information and assistance and should be contacted when an optimal course of action is unclear. Many physicians can achieve long-term recovery and sobriety with appropriate treatment, aftercare, and monitoring, although certain specialties, such as anesthesiology, present unique challenges and concerns. Given the potential harm that might befall both the addicted physician and patients, it is essential that family, friends, colleagues, and employers not “turn a blind eye” to a physician in whom addiction is suspected. Effective, and often life-saving, evaluation and treatment are available and must be sought for the benefit of all.\n\n【59】Author Interview\n----------------\n\n【60】**Video of interview with Dr. Nancy Snyderman of MSNBC and Dr. Lanier, Editor-in-Chief**", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

We present the case of a woman with ST-elevation MI who, despite successful and prompt percutaneous intervention, continued to remain electrically and hemodynamically unstable despite repeated defibrillation, intravenous antiarrhythmic inotropic drugs, and use of an IABP. Emergency establishment of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) led to immediate electrical and hemodynamic improvement with subsequent patient survival and recovery. From this experience, we demonstrate that ECMO can be a lifesaving approach in the catheterization laboratory for emergency treatment of patients with cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias due to acute MI; thus, ECMO should be considered early during resuscitation.\n\n【5】Report of a Case\n----------------\n\n【6】A previously healthy 46-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 28-hour history of acute-onset chest pressure and dyspnea. She appeared severely distressed, with ongoing chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. Her vital signs included a blood pressure of 129/96 mm Hg, heart rate of 124 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min.\n\n【7】Her electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with ST elevation in leads V <sub>3 </sub> through V <sub>6 </sub> , II, III, and aVF suggestive of anterior, anterolateral, and inferior myocardial injury . Her baseline electrical activity was unstable, and an electrocardiogram 4 minutes later demonstrated nonsustained ventricular tachycardia . Her initial troponin T level was 0.95 ng/mL (reference range, <0.01 ng/mL \\[to convert to μg/L, multiply by 1\\]).\n\n【8】She was diagnosed as having an ST-elevation MI and referred for emergency coronary angiography after the administration of oral aspirin, oral clopidogrel, and intravenous unfractionated heparin.\n\n【9】Figure 1 A, Electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation showing sinus tachycardia with ST elevation in leads V <sub>3 </sub> through V <sub>6 </sub> , II, III, and aVF suggestive of anterior, anterolateral, and inferior myocardial injury. B, An ECG 4 minutes after the initial ECG, showing rhythm instability and ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【10】On arrival in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the patient experienced ventricular fibrillation and required cardiac defibrillation, tracheal intubation, and controlled ventilation with 100% oxygen. Left coronary angiography revealed mobile thrombus in the left main (LM) coronary artery, 100% ostial occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, and thrombus embolization into the circumflex artery . The LM and LAD arteries were treated with aspiration thrombectomy and angioplasty with restoration of perfusion to the LM and mid-LAD arteries . Intravenous eptifibatide therapy was also initiated during the intervention to maximize platelet inhibition.\n\n【11】Figure 2 Right anterior oblique caudal view of the left coronary system with thrombus noted in the distal left main artery (arrow), and an occluded left anterior descending artery and thrombus in the obtuse marginal branch of the circumflex artery (hatched arrow).\n\n【12】Figure 3 Right anterior oblique cranial view of the left coronary system with an intracoronary wire placed in the previously occluded left anterior descending artery and improved perfusion.\n\n【13】Throughout the procedure, the patient required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for recurrent cardiac arrest and received a total of 10 shocks for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Adequacy of chest compressions throughout the resuscitation were assessed by arterial waveforms monitored via a catheter in the right femoral artery. To prevent fatigue while performing CPR, causing a deterioration in CPR efficacy, chest compressors were changed at 2-minute intervals during brief rhythm analysis or when chest compression cadence decreased below 100/min. The patient's profound electrical and hemodynamic instability persisted despite administration of amiodarone, vasopressin, intravenous epinephrine, and the placement of an IABP. Severe pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema, as evidenced in the anesthesia circuit, contributed to her persistent hypoxemia.\n\n【14】Advanced percutaneous left ventricular assist devices were considered for circulatory support but not used out of concern that they might not have provided the immediate improvement in oxygenation or increase in cardiac output necessary to protect neurologic and myocardial viability. Instead, a venoarterial ECMO system was placed via the right femoral artery and vein. The vein was cannulated with a 25F cannula that extended into the right atrium, and the artery was cannulated with a 17F cannula. Serial vascular dilators were used to enable percutaneous placement of these large-caliber cannulas. Immediate pre-ECMO arterial blood analysis revealed a pH of 6.82 and a base deficit of less than −25 mmol/L. Initiation of ECMO led to immediate electrical and hemodynamic stability, and no further CPR was required. However, IABP support was continued to improve diastolic perfusion of the coronary arteries. Initial echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%. Figure 4 demonstrates the documented course of events from arrival in the catheterization laboratory.\n\n【15】Figure 4 Timeline of events after the patient's arrival to the catheterization laboratory (cath lab). CPR = cardiopulmonary resuscitation; ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; IABP = intra-aortic balloon pump.\n\n【16】The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, cooled to 34°C for 24 hours, and maintained on ECMO at a cardiac index of 1.8 to 2.0. She demonstrated progressive neurologic recovery and awoke at 24 hours. Her hemodynamics improved during the subsequent week but not enough that ECMO could be discontinued. Her peak creatine kinase–MB level was 358 ng/mL (reference range, <3.8 ng/mL) (to convert to μg/L, multiply by 1), and her peak troponin level was 12.6 ng/mL. She was successfully weaned from ECMO on day 8, and low-dose epinephrine and vasopressin were continued as intravenous infusions. She had minimal bleeding but no other ECMO-associated complications. The IABP was continued while she was receiving ECMO to increase blood flow to the coronary arteries and brain and to counteract the increased afterload effects of ECMO. The IABP was removed on day 9, and she was extubated soon after. Her subsequent hospital course was complicated by a pulmonary embolism and splenic vein thrombosis. Gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of a thrombotic mass in her ascending colon necessitated a partial colectomy with benign disease documented on pathology. Dilation and curettage were also performed for endometrial thickening. Thrombophilia and hematology evaluation suggested that she had an acquired thrombophilia due to thrombocytosis secondary to iron deficiency anemia. We speculate that her coronary thrombi were likely formed at the site of an unstable atherosclerotic lesion in the ostium of the LAD artery, with fragments subsequently embolizing within the circumflex artery. She was discharged from the hospital 30 days after her MI with intact neurologic status, and she continues to do well as an outpatient (last assessed in January 2013). At her last echocardiogram evaluation 2 months after her event, the left ventricular ejection fraction was 30% to 35%.\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】Cardiogenic shock related to ongoing MI that persists despite revascularization may lead to subsequent multiorgan failure. Injured myocardium may retain substantial viability after successful revascularization, but functional recovery often lags by several days, thereby necessitating extrinsic hemodynamic support. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines recommend placement of an IABP in the setting of cardiogenic shock or ischemia-related intractable ventricular arrhythmias (Class IIa, Level of Evidence of B).\n\n【19】ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction—executive summary: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to Revise the 1999 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction).\n\n【20】However, in the patient we described, pharmacologic therapy and insertion of an IABP failed to resolve the life-threatening, persistent cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias after coronary revascularization. Instead, we relied on ECMO as a bridge therapy to sustain hemodynamics until the patient’s heart fully recovered. This case is unique in that ECMO was considered early and initiated effectively in the catheterization laboratory, resulting in immediate hemodynamic and rhythm stability. Given the severity of metabolic abnormality, the degree of hypoxemia with fulminant pulmonary edema, and the prolonged duration of CPR, one would not have predicted whether a full recovery was possible, and termination of resuscitation would have been justified. Our experience with the inadequacy of the IABP support is consistent with the recent Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock (SHOCK) II trial, which failed to demonstrate significant reduction in 30-day mortality in patients with acute MI and cardiogenic shock treated with an IABP placement.\n\n【21】Intraaortic balloon support for myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock.\n\n【22】Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can provide oxygenation and circulatory support and may have a distinct advantage over purely hemodynamic support devices, especially in the setting of persistent hypoxemia and severely reduced cardiac function. Although data are limited regarding its utility in acute MI and cardiogenic shock, smaller studies have indicated a potential benefit. One single-center, retrospective series of 33 patients who received ECMO support in the setting of persistent cardiogenic shock, despite the use of vasopressors and IABP placement, suggested improved survival compared with 25 patients with similar clinical characteristics treated with IABP alone.\n\n【23】Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-assisted primary percutaneous coronary intervention may improve survival of patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by profound cardiogenic shock.\n\n【24】There is also evidence of improved 30-day survival in patients presenting in severe shock during MI, with a 33% absolute risk reduction and a 45.8% relative risk reduction of death associated with ECMO therapy.\n\n【25】Early extracorporeal membrane oxygenator-assisted primary percutaneous coronary intervention improved 30-day clinical outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction complicated with profound cardiogenic shock.\n\n【26】Another single-center, retrospective study of 98 patients receiving extracorporeal life support for cardiogenic shock during acute coronary artery syndrome found that 32.7% survived to hospital dismissal. This study included 41 patients who had pulseless electrical activity and/or asystole, which seemed to be an independent indicator of inpatient mortality.\n\n【27】In a study of 35 patients, ECMO benefit did not differ among revascularization strategy (percutaneous intervention vs coronary bypass).\n\n【28】Overall, these are small studies with multiple confounders, but they indicate the potential value of ECMO support in patients with unstable acute coronary syndrome.\n\n【29】In the United States specifically, ECMO has been used on a limited basis for supporting adults. According to the International Extracorporeal Life Support Organization, the only reporting registry for ECMO, 876 US adults who received extracorporeal CPR within the past 20 years (without accounting for cardiogenic shock) had a 26% survival. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for pure cardiac support was used in 709 adult patients documented in 2012, with an overall survival of 39%.\n\n【30】Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is still of limited use throughout the world for cardiac support in adults and even less for adult extracorporeal CPR. Nonetheless, its use is becoming more frequent and is potentially lifesaving, such as in this patient.\n\n【31】Likewise, data are limited regarding other percutaneously placed left ventricular assist devices, such as Impella (Abiomed, Inc) or TandemHeart (CardiacAssist, Inc). In one randomized trial comparing 12 patients treated with Impella to 13 patients treated with IABP, the improvement in the cardiac index was greater in the Impella group, but the 30-day mortality remained the same for both groups.\n\n【32】A randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device versus intra-aortic balloon pumping for treatment of cardiogenic shock caused by myocardial infarction.\n\n【33】Similarly, a meta-analysis of 3 studies that compared IABP to percutaneous left ventricular assist devices (TandemHeart or Impella) failed to demonstrate improvement in 30-day mortality for patients in cardiogenic shock. Although the hemodynamics improved with the 2 left ventricular assist devices, there was a greater risk of bleeding with TandemHeart and higher levels of observed hemolysis with Impella.\n\n【34】Percutaneous left ventricular assist devices vs. intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation for treatment of cardiogenic shock: a meta-analysis of controlled trials.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【36】This case demonstrates the value of venoarterial ECMO in the setting of cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias precipitated by an acute MI. In our case, ECMO resolved the patient's ventricular arrhythmia and stabilized her hemodynamics until cardiac recovery. At 4 months after MI, the patient was asymptomatic and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% to 35%. When available in the catheterization laboratory for emergency use, ECMO may serve as an ancillary lifesaving measure for patients with cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of an acute MI. Moreover, it should be considered early during the resuscitative efforts to optimize potential benefit, including the stabilization of arrhythmias and limiting additional organ injury.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Among his many important contributions was the isolation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). He demonstrated its involvement in numerous metabolic processes.\n\n【1】Sutherland was born on November 19, 1915, in Burlingame, a small town in eastern Kansas. His father had been a farmer in New Mexico and Oklahoma, but when the family moved to Kansas, he became a dry-goods merchant. Sutherland graduated from Washburn College in Topeka, Kan, in 1937 and received an MD degree from Washington University Medical School in St Louis, Mo, in 1942. After graduating from medical school, he served in the US Army until 1945, first as a battalion surgeon in the field and then as a staff physician in a military hospital in Germany. After being discharged from the army in 1945, Sutherland returned to St Louis to work in the laboratory of American biochemist and 1947 Nobel Prize laureate Carl F. Cori (1896–1984), who directed Sutherland to a research career. Sutherland became a professor at Washington University, and during his 8 years there he concentrated on 2 projects: the investigation of phosphorylase (an enzyme for initiating the breakdown of glycogen in the liver and in muscles) and the determination of how the hormones epinephrine and glucagon cause the liver to release glucose.\n\n【2】Sutherland remained in St Louis until 1953, when he was appointed professor and director of the department of medicine and the department of pharmacology at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio (now Case Western Reserve University), where he discovered cAMP in 1956. He analyzed phosphorylase and found that 2 other enzymes are also present in liver extract: one that converts active phosphorylase to its inactive form, releasing inorganic phosphate, and another that reactivates the inactive form, incorporating inorganic phosphate into the molecule. This phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction is one of the basic biochemical energy-releasing processes of organisms.\n\n【3】In 1963, Sutherland became professor of physiology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn, where he continued his research on cAMP. From 1973 until his death in 1974, he was on the faculty of the University of Miami Medical School (Fla).\n\n【4】After 1971, Sutherland turned his attention to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (3',5' -GMP) like which, like cAMP, is widely distributed in tissues. In addition, he investigated how the hormone adrenaline regulates carbohydrate metabolism by the role of cAMP intermediates in hormonal activities and the involvement of cAMP in the transmission of genetic information and in abnormal cell growth.\n\n【5】On May 9, 1974, at the age of 58 years, Sutherland had a massive esophageal hemorrhage and died in Miami, Fla.

However, it seems to be catching up at an accelerated pace as some of the health care macroeconomic forces assume national prominence. Memphis is an unusual town in that there are 2 major health care systems, and patients are driven to one system or the other based on the exclusivity of insurance contracts. Physicians are contracted with most payors, but this arrangement has created 2 separate hospital networks with large subspecialty groups driving most of the care and a smaller primary care population that is rapidly consolidating. During the past year or two, there has been increasing consolidation, primarily from hospitals acquiring practices at escalating rates. This includes a focus on primary care but also includes large subspecialty practices. In addition, there are 2 large subspecialty practices of national accord in Memphis specializing in neurosurgery and orthopedics, respectively, that are aligned with the University of Tennessee.\n\n【1】Health Choice is working on a number of projects through a physician hospital organization structure. Health Choice is a 50/50 joint venture between Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare and MetroCare Physicians. Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare is an integrated health care delivery system with 7 hospitals in the Memphis area. It has an inner city hospital affiliated with the University of Tennessee, as well as 3 suburban hospitals, a pediatric hospital, a rural hospital, a long-term acute care hospital, and a skilled nursing facility inside a large academic medical center. MetroCare is an independent physician association composed of approximately 1500 physicians in the Memphis metro area. This joint venture has been in existence since 1985 and is currently focused on the messenger model of managed care contracting. We also partner with physicians and their staffs, hospitals and ancillary facilities, insurance companies, brokers, and consultants to provide a myriad of services such as resolution of global claims issues, physician and staff education, credentialing, customer service, and insurance services.\n\n【2】Accountable care and clinical integration have been a challenge in Memphis. Up to this point, care has been fragmented, with a preferred provider organization–type market with direct access to specialty care. In addition, electronic medical record adaption has been slow and is still fragmented, with many groups not having any type of electronic medical records. This includes some very large groups. The groups that do have electronic medical records often have different systems, and few of the systems are linked together. Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare has recently completed the rollout of computerized physician order entry in all of its hospitals and is continuing down the road to achieve meaningful use and information technology integration. It is early in the thought process to expect full clinical integration and coordination of care among their providers. As more physicians are employed or affiliated via a provider services agreement and other mechanisms, an accountable care organization becomes practical.\n\n【3】Getting into the Medicare Shared Savings Program or creating a Medicare Accountable Care Organization was contemplated. After reviewing the initial rules, there was concern. Although the subsequent rule changes alleviated some concern, it still presented significant challenges. Attribution of members was one challenge, since the final attribution was not resolved until the end of the study period. There is no way to keep the patient from going to competitors either out of network locally or out of network on a national basis. This can add additional cost and complexity and limit the ability for care to be managed. There is also the issue of administrative complexity, with numerous quality indicators and multiple items that must be tracked and trended. While this is prudent, it also adds a tremendous amount of administrative cost. This current payment structure seems somewhat counterproductive in a hospital centric system and leads to some hesitancy in developing this model in the short term since much of the savings is based on eliminating preventable admissions and readmissions to the hospital. Currently, the risk model that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has designed does not allow enough upside compensation to cover the intensive infrastructure that is required.\n\n【4】Health Choice believed that dealing with Medicare Advantage plans first might be a good entrée into the accountable care arena. Medicare Advantage plans offer the advantage of knowing the full attribution up front so that the physicians will know who is in the plan. They also have the luxury of a panel with the ability to track referrals and specialist referrals and get claims data quickly and easily from the managed care organizations. The risk model (upside and downside) can also be tailored to current strategies and interventions.\n\n【5】Health Choice has started an accountable care organization. It is a commercial-based product in which one of the payers has worked through their administrative services organization to fund primary care physicians in their move toward a patient-centered medical home model and to make them accountable for cost and quality. The project, called MACH1 (Memphis Accountable Care Home), has 27 primary care physicians in 7 practices working together in a collaborative effort. Payment is fee-for-service; however, there is an additional payment in the form of a per-member per-month. Health Choice provides assistance with transformation of the practices, care management, and analytics. Health Choice also helps link data from hospitals and practice electronic medical records to manage the patient population. This is also a shared savings payment based on bending of the trend curve at the end of each year. Any savings in this model is shared equally with the physicians and the employers (who are funding this project through the payer). The practices have committed to achieving level 3 National Committee for Quality Assurance certification as a patient-centered medical home. Many quality metrics are part of this process, as well as a commitment to improve quality and reduce overall costs. There is a strong focus on population health and a dedicated care manager in each office, a centralized care manager, and a health plan–employed case manager (at our physician hospitals organization). Future plans include adding specialists and hospitals into the risk portion of this project.\n\n【6】Discussions are ongoing with other commercial payers using similar models, including pay-for-performance, pay-for-quality, and bundling models. There is no doubt that these new payment models are coming, and Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare and Health Choice are actively looking at ways to move toward clinical integration, patient-centered care, and population-based care. It is important that payment models not lag too far behind the care integration models and that the appropriate infrastructure is in place before undertaking any aggressive risk arrangements.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The premise underlying this test is based on autonomous hypersecretion of aldosterone, from either a solitary adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, totally independent of the usual control exerted by the renin-angiotensin mechanism. The suppression of PRA occurs as a consequence of the hyperaldosteronism that causes volume expansion and elevated blood pressure, which in turn inhibit release of renin from the juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys. The aldosterone-renin ratio combines the measurement of aldosterone and renin into a single value that is intended to magnify the autonomous nature of aldosterone in patients with primary aldosteronism.\n\n【4】Montori et al provide data from a meticulous study of 497 patients previously diagnosed as having essential hypertension who had aldosterone-renin ratios measured under different conditions: supine before diuretic therapy, seated before diuretic therapy, and seated after diuretic therapy. Their purpose was to determine whether the aldosterone-renin ratio provides a measure of hyperaldosteronism that is totally independent from plasma renin levels, a relationship that must hold true if an elevated aldosteronerenin ratio is to serve as a marker for primary aldosteronism.\n\n【5】Their data clearly show that the aldosterone-renin ratio is dependent on variations in PRA levels; thus, “elevation of the aldosterone-renin ratio was predominantly a sign of low PRA, rather than a measure of elevated PAC relative to PRA.” Montori et al note further that “elevation of the aldosterone-renin ratio … can be more appropriately characterized as an indication of low PRA … than as a sign of an inappropriately elevated PAC.”\n\n【6】The study by Montori et al may have included some patients with unrecognized primary aldosteronism since no details were provided about the certainty of the diagnosis of “essential hypertension.” Moreover, one of the principal findings, that the aldosterone-renin ratio decreased after diuretic therapy , could reflect a suppression of aldosterone secretion due to the degree of diuretic-induced reduction in serum potassium.\n\n【7】Neither of these possibilities negates the major findings of Montori et al. However, these data do not, by themselves, negate the value of the aldosterone-renin ratio as a screening test for primary aldosteronism if, as Montori et al point out, there is a requirement for an absolute elevation in PAC. Unfortunately, most recent studies that use the aldosterone-renin ratio simply require an elevated ratio without regard for the necessity of an elevated PAC.\n\n【8】Many patients with hypertension, particularly elderly or black patients or those with renal damage, have extremely low PRA levels, often as low as 0.1 ng·mL <sup>−1 </sup> ·h <sup>−1 </sup> . Obviously, such a low PRA with even a low PAC of 5 μg/dL would produce a high aldosterone-renin ratio. Therefore, the major clinical message of the analysis by Montori et al must be to demand both a low PRA and a high PAC. As Stewart noted, the better approach would be to express the data as a subnormal PRA and an elevated PAC rather than as a ratio.\n\n【9】As I have written previously, numerous reasons exist for being cautious about the current epidemic of primary aldosteronism. Since the enthusiasts\n\n【10】claim that neither hypertension nor hypokalemia is necessarily seen in patients who presumably have primary aldosteronism, promiscuous and misguided overuse of the aldosterone-renin ratio could lead to unnecessary work-ups that are expensive, possibly harmful, and sometimes misleading. Moreover, more patients likely have adrenal “incidentalomas” than aldosterone-producing adenomas; thus, there is a strong possibility of unnecessary surgery if an elevated aldosteronerenin ratio is the only basis for the diagnosis. Finally, the largest proportion of patients with an elevated aldosteronerenin ratio who are subsequently found to have autonomous hyperaldosteronism have bilateral adrenal hyperplasia that must be treated medically, rather than an aldosterone-producing adenoma in which surgery is usually appropriate.\n\n【11】All in all, I believe the data from Montori et al should help squelch some of the current overenthusiasm in diagnosing primary aldosteronism that is based on inappropriate use and interpretation of the aldosterone-renin ratio.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Indeed, the FDA has taken a position opposing such purchases.\n\n【1】Congress established a system of drug regulation in the United States many years ago, with the understanding that drugs were both risky and beneficial. Drugs in the United States must be carefully tested by manufacturers for both safety and efficacy and approved by FDA medical staff before marketing can commence. Once approved, drugs must be made under exacting specifications overseen by the FDA and then enter a regulatory system of prescribing and dispensing overseen by the states. That system has served us well from a safety point of view and recognizes that even minor deviations in drug manufacturing, handling, or dispensing can have serious negative health ramifications for patients.\n\n【2】With that vigorous regulatory stance in mind, the FDA has both short-term and long-term safety concerns about importing drugs from other countries. In the short term, we know that often the sellers of Canadian drugs are not trained or licensed pharmacists, they sell Americans poor-quality drugs, and they seem at times not to be in Canada or associated with Canada (despite their claims of Canadian origin). Thus, we see immediate health risks for our citizens who buy these drugs. In the long term, we are concerned that importation undermines the safety system that has been carefully constructed in the United States and could lead to a “slippery slope” of drug sales to Americans by third world drug makers, counterfeiters, and others who would love to infiltrate our market with unsafe or poor-quality drugs. That those foreign sources have no interest in protecting Americans or ensuring that our patients receive safe and effective drugs is undeniable, at least based on evidence that such individuals are known to sell drugs that range from ineffective to dangerous.\n\n【3】Balanced against these safety fears is an equally serious concern that some Americans cannot afford their prescription drugs, and that is a societal problem that needs addressing. However, it is not one that the FDA is positioned to address. The FDA has no real role in drug costs (other than such processes as approving substantially less-expensive generic versions of brand name drugs). Asking the FDA to lower its historically high safety standards to solve a cost problem is something it opposes—both because opposition is the correct stance to take and because the FDA is compelled by its statute to do so.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "544788a3-ba57-4577-b89a-c309aae436cd", "title": "Medical Advice for International Travelers", "text": "【0】Medical Advice for International Travelers\nEach year, approximately 30 to 40 million Americans travel outside the United States. Although the most popular destinations are Europe, Central America, and the Caribbean, travel to Africa and Asia is increasing substantially. International travel, particularly to developing countries, can be associated with the risk of infectious and noninfectious diseases. These risks can be decreased, eliminated, or modified with vaccinations, prophylactic medications, and education. Optimally, pretravel advice must be individualized to a person's medical history, itinerary, and risk behavior. In addition to risk assessment-based immunizations, issues such as traveler's diarrhea, malaria prophylaxis, sexually transmitted diseases, and management of underlying medical problems must form a part of pretravel management. Adventure or prolonged travel or persons with underlying medical diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, transplantation, immunodeficiencies, and dialysis warrant additional preventive measures. This review primarily updates pretravel management of adults.\n\n【1】AIDS ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ), DVT ( deep venous thrombosis ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), TD ( traveler's diarrhea )\n\n【2】As tourism grows, an increasing number of people are traveling to higher-risk destinations; thus, clinicians must become familiar with recommendations for travel health safety. Each year, 30 to 40 million Americans travel outside the United States.\n\n【3】According to the World Tourism Organization, in 2000, world tourism in general grew by an estimated 7.4%, bringing the total number of international travelers to a record 698 million.\n\n【4】This growth in tourism is considered the highest in almost a decade.\n\n【5】Trends also indicate an increase of travel to African and Asian countries in the past decade. Medical problems are experienced by 20% to 70% of all travelers: 1% to 5% require medical care, 0.01% to 0.1% require emergency air evacuation, and 1 in 100,000 die.\n\n【6】Although cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of mortality among travelers, the mortality rate is similar to that for non-travelers. Specific travel-related mortality is higher because of accidents, which account for 21% to 26% of travel-related deaths.\n\n【7】PRETRAVEL SCREENING\n-------------------\n\n【8】Pretravel screening helps to stratify risk of the traveler. Risk stratification involves reviewing the itinerary, behavior patterns (such as eating habits), underlying medical history, and vaccine or medication contraindications. Details of the itinerary, lodging, budget, duration, and time to departure are extremely helpful in preparing the traveler for the trip. Prolonged travel, backpacking, low-budget travel, foreign-born individuals returning to visit friends and family, and imminent travel are associated with a higher incidence of travel-related complications. Medical problems or issues such as diabetes, transplantation, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and end-stage renal failure may substantially affect the immunogenicity of vaccines and implications for health while traveling. Live vaccines are contraindicated in immunocompromised or pregnant persons; thus, travel to a particular risk area is not possible. For example, patients who cannot receive the yellow fever vaccine should not travel to the Amazon. Allergies to vaccine components such as thimerosal or aluminum or to medications such as sulfonamides may preclude use of certain vaccines or medications. Contact allergy to thimerosal is not a contraindication to thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n\n【9】GENERAL ADVICE\n--------------\n\n【10】Elderly persons or those with chronic medical diseases may benefit from a pretravel physical examination. Travelers should carry a letter stating medical diagnosis, list of medications with doses, and needles or syringes. Some medications, such as methylphenidate hydrochloride, are prohibited in certain countries. Carrying a letter from a physician may prevent problems at airports. Travelers should carry enough essential medications to last the duration of the trip, and the supply should be divided between carry-on and check-in baggage. Medications should be in original bottles with appropriate labels. Because dental problems can occur, patients with ongoing dental illnesses should have a dental examination before they travel to avoid invasive procedures in other countries. Most health insurance companies do not cover medical expenses that occur outside the United States. Travelers should consider additional travel health and air evacuation insurance, irrespective of their age, medical history, or type of travel.\n\n【11】Studies have shown that 25% to 50% of travelers engage in sexual relations with new partners abroad, including other tourists, locals, or commercial sex workers.\n\n【12】Risk behaviour and HIV prevalence in international travellers.\n\n【13】Differences in sexual risk behaviour between young men and women travelling abroad from the UK.\n\n【14】Discussing alcohol consumption and safe sex with patients may help in preventing sexually transmitted diseases while traveling; this is especially relevant in light of increasing worldwide HIV prevalence. Patients should be advised to bring condoms from the United States because of poor availability or quality of condoms in some developing countries.\n\n【15】Because accidents are the most common preventable cause of mortality during travel, patients must be reminded to avoid high-risk situations, such as driving in a foreign country, riding 2-wheelers (motorcycles, scooters), or riding in overcrowded buses, particularly in adverse weather conditions or under the influence of alcohol. Travelers should follow basic traffic laws. Seat belt use should be encouraged, but the availability of functional seat belts may be severely limited in some developing countries.\n\n【16】Illnesses related to air travel include motion sickness, barotrauma, hypoxemia in select patients, and possibly deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Motion sickness is common with flying. Patients can be advised to take either meclizine or dimenhydrinate for prophylaxis. Although airplanes are pressurized, expansion of air can occur and cause barotrauma in air-or gas-containing organs, particularly the ears, sinuses, and gastrointestinal tract. Swallowing or chewing during take-off and descent may decrease ear barotrauma. Ear barotrauma is more likely to occur in a traveler with a cold or an eustachian tube dysfunction. Occasionally, a serous otitis or tympanic membrane perforation can occur but usually resolves spontaneously. Because of air expansion, air travel is a relative contraindication for patients who have recently undergone abdominal surgery (previous 2 weeks). Patients with severe anemia (hemoglobin level <7 g/dL), sickle cell trait or disease, underlying chronic pulmonary obstructive disease and chronic hypoxia, or recent cerebrovascular accident may experience exacerbation of symptoms. Such patients may need to have oxygen on board, which must be arranged ahead of time with the airlines. Also, most airlines require a physician to verify the patient's ability to fly safely and to provide a certification called the Medical Fitness for Air Travel form.\n\n【17】The available data suggest that an association, although small, exists between air travel and DVT.\n\n【18】All patients, particularly those with risk factors such as a history of DVT, recent surgery or trauma, malignancy, obesity, pregnancy, or genetic prothrombotic predisposition and women taking oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, should be advised to exercise their legs during the flight. The role of aspirin in the prevention of DVT is controversial. Compression stockings may be reasonable for patients at risk for DVT, and prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered for very high-risk patients.\n\n【19】Jet lag and fatigue occur commonly in international travelers. Jet lag, typically worse when flying eastward, results from desynchronization of the sleep-wake cycle and other internal circadian rhythms, such as hormonal or temperature rhythms. For short and/or a series of short international flights (<72 hours), the patient should be advised to take brief naps at the corresponding home afternoon time or at late nighttime. Napping for less than 40 minutes avoids reverting to the home sleep cycle. For longer eastward trips, activities should be adjusted to correspond with time on the plane and on arrival. A mild bedtime sedative for 3 to 4 days after arrival at the destination or after return to the United States may help adjust the sleep cycle. Potential adverse effects, such as daytime drowsiness, that may interfere with planned activities or driving should be discussed. Patients could try the medication once before leaving home to ensure no adverse effects. Use of melatonin for jet lag is controversial and has not been clearly shown to be effective.\n\n【20】IMMUNIZATIONS\n-------------\n\n【21】An important part of advice to travelers is vaccination against common and travel-related vaccine-preventable diseases. A review of immunization against diseases such as diphtheria, measles, and polio is advised because some of these diseases are prevalent in many developing countries. Although specific travel-related vaccinations may not be cost-effective, they are beneficial and may be required or recommended depending on travel history. Vaccine recommendations are best individualized to each traveler's itinerary, activities, time before departure (for completion of schedules or to mount an adequate immune response), previous immunizations, and medical history.\n\n【22】Travel vaccine schedules, boosters, common contraindications, and adverse effects are listed in Table 1 .\n\n【23】Table 1 Common Vaccines for International Travelers\n\n【24】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【25】AIDS = acquired immunodeficiency syndrome;

Incidence of cholera is highest in Africa, accounting for 72% of global cholera. At present, an epidemic of _V cholerae_ biotype _eltor_ , is ongoing in South Africa. Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and countries in the Middle East and Asia have ongoing seventh pandemic cases. Because the risk of cholera to an average traveler is low (0.01%-0.001% per month of stay in a developing country), a cholera vaccine is rarely indicated. However, vaccination is advised for persons working with refugee populations, those living in endemic-epidemic areas, and military personnel. Currently, cholera vaccine is not required for entry into any country. The parenteral vaccine has been discontinued in the United States because of its frequent adverse effects and brief and unreliable immunogenicity. Newer oral cholera vaccines (an inactivated whole cell-B subunit vaccine and a live attenuated CVD 103-HgR _V cholerae_ 01 serogroup vaccine) provide better immunity (85%-90% and 60%-100%, respectively) with fewer adverse effects.\n\n【36】Both of these vaccines are licensed in countries other than the United States. Therefore, the current best advice for travelers going to cholera-endemic areas is to adhere to strict food and water precautions and to learn self-management of severe watery diarrhea.\n\n【37】### Hepatitis A and Immunoglobulin\n\n【38】Hepatitis A is a predominantly food-borne viral hepatitis that occurs worldwide. Risk is low in Australia, Japan, Korea, North America, and Europe including southern Europe. Hepatitis A is the most frequently occurring vaccine-preventable disease among travelers. Ingestion of fecally contaminated water or food, such as raw seafood, is the source of infection. The risk increases with indiscriminate eating habits, person-to-person contact, and prolonged travel duration. The risk of acquisition of hepatitis A among nonimmune travelers is 3 to 20 cases per 1000 nonimmune persons who stay in a developing country for at least a month.\n\n【39】Approximately 10% of 1- to 14-year-old and 20% of 15- to 40-year-old patients with hepatitis A require hospitalization. Mortality increases with age, being greater than 2% in persons older than 40 years. The inactivated hepatitis A vaccines (Vaqta \\[Merck\\] and Havrix \\[SmithKline Beecham\\]), available in the United States since the mid-1990s, are extremely efficacious and safe. Both vaccines provide protective antibody levels in 94% to 100% of patients within 4 weeks of vaccination, and both can be used interchangeably. Immunity among children younger than 2 years is limited because of poor immunogenicity. Maternal antibody interferes with immunity in children younger than 12 months. Immune response may be limited in immunocompromised hosts. US immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A who visit their home countries should be vaccinated according to hepatitis A serostatus because most are likely to be immune. Coadministration of passive immunity (85%-90% protection)\n\n【40】with γ-globulin should be reserved for high-risk patients traveling imminently (<2 weeks), such as elderly persons, children younger than 2 years, those with underlying medical problems, or immunocompromised persons. Concurrent administration of most vaccines is not contraindicated with γ-globulin except the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine. Because of the long incubation period of hepatitis A virus and the rapid onset of protection with the vaccine, the vaccine alone may be adequate in most healthy persons for whom travel is imminent.\n\n【41】### Hepatitis B Vaccine\n\n【42】Areas with a high prevalence of hepatitis B include Asia, Africa, parts of South America, the Middle East, southern and western Pacific islands, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Risk of hepatitis B for travelers is mainly associated with medical or dental care abroad, potential blood transfusion for an accident or illness, and sexual or needle exposures. Expatriation and frequent or prolonged international travel to developing countries are indications for initiating inactivated recombinant hepatitis B vaccination (Recombivax HB \\[Merck\\]; Engerix-B \\[SmithKline Beecham\\]). Health care workers, volunteers, or missionaries in developing countries require the hepatitis B vaccine series. For patients leaving imminently, an accelerated schedule can be used to achieve protective immunity. Currently, only Engerix-B has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an accelerated schedule of 0, 1, and 2 months with a 12-month booster.\n\n【43】### Combined Hepatitis A and B Vaccine\n\n【44】A new combined hepatitis A (Havrix \\[720 EL U/mL\\]) and hepatitis B (Engerix-B \\[20 μg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen\\]) vaccine called Twinrix (SmithKline Beecham) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for use in adults older than 18 years. Twinrix is given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. Studies have shown that Twinrix is as efficacious as the monovalent vaccines of Havrix (99% of the vaccinees are seropositive at 2 months) and for hepatitis B (84% of the vaccinees are seropositive at 2 months).\n\n【45】This vaccine is convenient for long-term travelers and for those who need rapid protection.\n\n【46】The first combined vaccine against hepatitis A and B: an overview.\n\n【47】An accelerated schedule of 0, 7, and 21 days with a 12-month booster is as efficacious as a standard schedule.\n\n【48】Indications for this vaccine are similar to those for hepatitis B vaccine in travelers.\n\n【49】### Japanese B Encephalitis Vaccine\n\n【50】Japanese B encephalitis is a mosquito-borne viral encephalitis that occurs in rural parts of Asia, especially near pig farms. It is prevalent in China, the Indian subcontinent, Japan, eastern Russia, and other Southeast Asian countries. It has seasonal variation (more in summer, rainy months). Japanese B encephalitis has a 30% case fatality rate in patients with overt infections, with high neuropsychiatric sequelae. Risk of acquisition is mainly associated with extensive (=4 weeks) rural travel, backpacking, or rain forest travel in endemic countries. The full course of the inactivated Japanese B encephalitis vaccine (Biken) results in seroconversion in 100% of recipients, and neutralizing antibodies remain for at least 3 years. Common adverse effects like myalgias, headache, or fever occur in 20% of vaccine recipients, and hypersensitivity reactions (generalized urticaria, angioedema, respiratory distress, and anaphylaxis) occur in 0.6% of recipients.\n\n【51】Hypersensitivity reactions can be immediate or delayed up to 10 days and are more likely in persons with a history of urticaria or other allergies. Patients with Japanese B encephalitis must defer international travel and remain in areas with ready access to medical care for 10 days after receiving a dose of the vaccine.\n\n【52】### Meningococcal Vaccine\n\n【53】Certain areas of the world, especially central Africa, have seasonal epidemics caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ , mostly serogroups A or C, during the dry seasons (December through June). _N meningitidis_ is also an important cause of disease among travelers taking the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, and vaccination is required for entry into Saudi Arabia. The currently available vaccine in the United States (Menomune \\[Aventis\\]) is effective only against serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 and does not cover serogroup B. Since October 1999, meningococcal vaccine has been recommended for college students living in US dormitories. Requirements are similar for students traveling abroad to study in other countries, such as the United Kingdom.\n\n【54】### Poliomyelitis Vaccine\n\n【55】Although poliomyelitis is reaching near eradication worldwide, pockets with ongoing wild strain transmission still exist, such as in African countries and in Asia. Poliomyelitis was declared eradicated from the Western Hemisphere until a recent outbreak of vaccine-strain polio in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Currently, all travelers to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia are advised to receive a 1-time adult parenteral inactivated trivalent polio vaccine booster if the primary series has been completed.\n\n【56】### Rabies\n\n【57】Unlike the United States where the principal vectors for rabies are wild animals or bats, in many parts of the world, particularly India, Nepal, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam, rabies is transmitted by dogs, cats, and other animals. A rabies preexposure vaccination with the inactivated viral rabies vaccine (HDCV \\[Imovax\\]) is recommended for expatriates, especially children, adventure travelers, and animal handlers. Preexposure prophylaxis precludes the need for rabies immunoglobulin if a bite occurs. Scarcity and safety of the rabies immunoglobulin worldwide highlights preexposure prophylaxis for select populations. If bitten, persons with preexposure vaccination still require 2 additional rabies vaccine doses (on the day of the bite and on day 3, instead of a full 5-dose course). All animals that bite, especially unprovoked, outside of the United States should be considered rabid unless proved otherwise, particularly in highly endemic countries. Patients should be advised to wash the wound immediately and seek medical care as soon as possible.\n\n【58】### Typhoid Fever\n\n【59】Typhoid vaccine is recommended for travel to regions highly endemic for _Salmonella typhi_ , such as the Indian subcontinent, parts of South America, and Africa. Travel to Mexico, Haiti, North Africa, and Iran is considered intermediate risk. Protective efficacy of the typhoid vaccines ranges from 46% to 96%.\n\n【60】The oral typhoid vaccine is not currently available in the United States. The older parenteral vaccine (Wyeth-Ayerst) had pronounced local and systemic adverse effects and has not been available in the United States since December 1999. The available typhoid vaccine (injectable Typhim Vi \\[Pasteur Merieux Connaught\\]) is better tolerated and has a protective efficacy of 64% to 72%. A new combined vaccine against typhoid fever and hepatitis A is being studied, and thus far it has been found to be safe and efficacious.\n\n【61】### Yellow Fever\n\n【62】Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne viral illness characterized by fever, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatitis, and encephalitis. The yellow fever vaccine must be administered at least 10 days before travel to endemic areas, such as equatorial parts of South America and Africa. It is a required vaccine for entry into some countries with ongoing epidemics. In other uninfected countries, a person must show proof of vaccination if traveling directly from an endemic or infected country in order to prevent introduction of the disease into the local vector. Since the yellow fever vaccine is a live-attenuated viral vaccine, it is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients, pregnant or lactating women, and infants younger than 6 months. Among immunocompromised persons, the risk of the actual disease vs the disease from the vaccine must be assessed. Persons with HIV or AIDS who have minimal immunosuppression (CD4 count >200 cells μL) can receive the vaccine. However, the immune response may be lower among these people compared with immunocompe-tent persons. Recently, vaccine strain disease was reported among elderly (>75 years) persons receiving the yellow fever vaccine.\n\n【63】### Routine Vaccines\n\n【64】Routine childhood vaccinations should be reviewed for all persons and boosters administered as necessary. In addition, pneumococcal and influenza vaccine recommendations should be reviewed. An influenza vaccine is advised for persons at high risk of influenza complications, such as those taking a cruise, traveling to the Southern Hemisphere during April through September, or traveling to tropical countries any time because influenza is nonseasonal in such areas, and for persons older than 50 years with or without underlying medical problems. Persons with no previous history of primary varicella should be tested and vaccinated if nonimmune.\n\n【65】MALARIA PREVENTION\n------------------\n\n【66】Annually, 300 to 500 million cases of malaria occur in more than 100 countries, and the numbers are increasing because of climate and other factors. Malaria among travelers is also increasing. _Plasmodium falciparum_ contributes to most malaria-related deaths. Approximately 30,000 travelers from industrialized countries contract malaria annually.\n\n【67】In the United States, about 1000 cases are reported annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; however, some may be unreported.\n\n【68】The risk of acquiring malaria depends on the duration of stay, geographic areas visited, risk behavior (extensive exposure to outdoors and rural areas and inadequate personal protective measures), and the type of prophylaxis taken. Among American travelers, the risk of _P falciparum_ malaria is highest among those traveling to Africa. Imported _P falciparum_ malaria has an overall mortality rate of 4% and is considerably higher in patients with severe disease. The mortality rate also increases with age (30% in persons >70 years). Fatal imported malaria is associated with nonadherence with or inappropriate chemoprophylaxis, delay in seeking medical attention, or delayed diagnosis or treatment.\n\n【69】Thus, travelers must seek appropriate pretravel advice for this preventable condition.\n\n【70】The choice of malaria chemoprophylaxis depends on area of travel, activities planned, and the individual's factors. Chloroquine-resistant _P falciparum_ malaria now dominates most endemic regions except Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and parts of the Middle East. _P falciparum_ malaria resistant to chloroquine and mefloquine has emerged along the borders of Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar (Burma). Resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimeth-amine is common among _P falciparum_ in the Amazon basin, Southeast Asia, and in parts of Africa. Over the past decade, chloroquine-resistant _P vivax_ malaria has been identified in Myanmar, Guyana, Papua New Guinea, and other areas of Southeast Asia.\n\n【71】Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all urban and rural travelers to sub-Saharan Africa (except most areas of South Africa), the Indian subcontinent, areas of Oceania (Far Southeast Asia including Papua New Guinea, Irian Jaya, and Vanuata), and Haiti, as well as for rural and nonresort exposures in Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and parts of Mexico, North Africa, and the Dominican Republic. Antimalarial prophylactic drug options based on drug-resistance patterns are listed in Table 2 .\n\n【72】Table 2 Malaria Prophylaxis\n\n| Prophylaxis | Chloroquine-susceptible areas\\*See text for areas of distribution. | Chloroquine-resistant areas\\*See text for areas of distribution. | Chloroquine- and mefloquine-resistant areas\\*See text for areas of distribution. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First choice First alternative | Chloroquine Mefloquine | Mefloquine Doxycycline | Doxycycline Atovaquone plus proguanil |\n| Other alternatives | Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, doxycycline | Atovaquone plus proguanil | … |\n\n【74】\\* See text for areas of distribution.\n\n【75】Chloroquine-susceptible _P falciparum_ malaria is now limited to Central America. Chloroquine is well tolerated, has minimal adverse effects (gastrointestinal upset being most common), and is safe for infants and pregnant women. Retinal toxicity is rare, even with long-term (years) weekly administration of chloroquine.\n\n【76】Mefloquine is the most widely used antimalarial prophylactic agent and is more than 90% efficacious.\n\n【77】Mefloquine compared with doxycycline for the prophylaxis of malaria in Indonesian soldiers: a randomized, double–blind, placebo–controlled trial.\n\n【78】It is given weekly as 250-mg salt, starting 1 to 2 weeks before travel, weekly while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after return. Mefloquine is recommended for chloroquine-resistant malaria (both _P falciparum_ and _P vivax_ ). Adverse effects of mefloquine are mostly dose related. At prophylactic doses, most adverse effects are mild and self-limited, including nausea, diarrhea, strange dreams, dizziness, insomnia, and headache. Nightmares, anxiety, and depression can occur, but drug discontinuation is necessary in less than 1% of prophylactic mefloquine users. Severe neuro-psychiatric reactions (psychosis, seizures) are reported to occur infrequently (approximately 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 13,000 persons) with prophylactic doses.\n\n【79】Contraindications to its use include history of seizures, arrhythmias, psychiatric illness, and a previous reaction to mefloquine. Mefloquine is safe for pregnant women in the second and third trimester and for children who weigh more than 5 kg.\n\n【80】Doxycycline (100 mg/d) is the alternative to mefloquine and is an equally efficacious prophylactic agent against mefloquine-resistant _P falciparum_ . Major drawbacks of doxycycline are daily administration (leading to rapid loss of antimalarial prophylaxis with missed doses), nausea, vomiting, occasional esophageal ulceration, photosensitivity, yeast superinfections, and inability to use in pregnant women and in children younger than 8 years. Advantages of doxycycline include quick onset of antimalarial activity, allowing administration for imminent entry into an endemic area, and some antibacterial effect against traveler's diarrhea (TD).\n\n【81】In 2000, the FDA approved atovaquone plus proguanil (250 mg/100 mg) (Malarone) for malaria prophylaxis and treatment in children and adults. Overall efficacy of Malarone for prophylaxis of _P falciparum_ malaria is 95% to 100% compared with placebo in semi-immune populations.\n\n【82】Efficacy and safety of atovaquone/proguanil as suppressive prophylaxis for _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria.\n\n【83】In nonimmune persons, the protection is 96% (68%-99%) for _P falciparum_ malaria and 81% (45%-94%) for _P vivax_ malaria. It is well tolerated, with mild gastrointestinal side effects being the most common adverse events. The main drawbacks are daily administration and cost, currently about $5 a day. For prophylaxis, Malarone is taken daily: initiated 2 days before the traveler enters an endemic area, taken daily while there, and taken for 7 days after return. It has some causal activity, ie, it is effective against the liver phase of the plasmodium life cycle. The prophylactic use of Malarone is best limited to travelers to chloroquine-resistant malaria areas who have contraindications to mefloquine and doxycycline or to travelers going to endemic areas for brief (2–7 days) trips. Malarone is also used for self-treatment of suspected malaria if a person develops malaria while in a foreign country and prophylaxis was inadequate, as long as the prophylaxis taken was not Malarone. It is the drug of choice for self-treatment in areas where sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance is common.\n\n【84】In some countries, another alternative to mefloquine or doxycycline is a combination of chloroquine with proguanil. However, it is not recommended because it is not as efficacious as the previously mentioned drugs. Proguanil is not available in the United States.\n\n【85】New antimalarials being studied for prophylaxis include tafenoquine, primaquine, etaquine, and azithromycin.\n\n【86】Use of personal protection measures, such as insect repellents, mosquito bed nets, and long-sleeved clothing and pants, should be reinforced to persons traveling to tropical countries not only for malaria protection but also for other insect-borne diseases.\n\n【87】Formulations with 30% to 35% of DEET ( _N_ , _N_ \\-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) are recommended for adequate protection and minimal toxic adverse effects. Of importance, patients should be reminded that sunscreen is applied first and then the insect repellent because insect repellents can decrease the efficacy of the sunscreen by 20% to 30%.\n\n【88】Plant-based insect repellents are not as effective as those containing DEET. Persons traveling into highly endemic areas or forests or those planning extensive outdoor exposure may be advised to use a clothing insecticide called permethrin. Permethrin impregnation of clothes is effective for 2 weeks despite laundry. Combined use of skin insect repellent and permethrin can decrease insect bites substantially.\n\n【89】TRAVELER'S DIARRHEA\n-------------------\n\n【90】Traveler's diarrhea is common during international travel, especially travel to developing countries. It accounts for 64% of all illnesses affecting tourists, and the most common cause is bacterial. Enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella_ , and _Shigella_ account for most cases _._ Enterotoxigenic _E coli_ occurs in 17% to 70% of TD in South America. Rotavirus, _Campylobacter_ , and _Salmonella_ occur more often in the winter. Parasitic etiology is not common in short-term travelers. _Cyclospora_ is commonly noted in Nepal. A pathogen is not identified in 40% of TD cases. In a study of 17,000 travelers, the incidence of TD was 26% to 50% in Central and South American countries, 40% in Africa, 50% in Nepal, and 10% in Europe.\n\n【91】The highest incidence of diarrhea occurs among children 2 years of age and younger and among adults 20 to 30 years of age. Although TD does not result in mortality, approximately one third of travelers are confined to bed, 40% have to change their itinerary, and less than 1% are hospitalized.\n\n【92】Host factors predisposing to TD include immunosuppression, hypochlorhydria, inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, and young age.\n\n【93】Prevention of TD includes education regarding risk factors and food and water hygiene. Risk factors include drinking tap water, iced drinks, or fresh juices; eating food in small restaurants or from vendors; eating locally made ice cream or flavored ices; and eating fruit not personally peeled by the traveler.\n\n【94】Patients with immunosuppression such as transplant recipients, those taking corticosteroids, and those with chronic medical problems such as inflammatory bowel disease may require prophylactic antibiotics to prevent TD. Prophylactic medications for TD include bismuth subsalicylate, antibiotics, or probiotic agents. Bismuth subsalicylate is effective in preventing 65% of cases of TD.\n\n【95】However, the disadvantages of bismuth subsalicylate include the number of doses needed, problems among patients taking aspirin or an anticoagulant, and black discoloration of the tongue and stool. Additionally, bismuth subsalicylate can decrease bioavailability of doxycycline by 30% to 50%, an important fact to remember in patients taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis. Use of antibiotics for TD prophylaxis is reserved for a select population, as described previously. Prophylactic ciprofloxacin has been shown to prevent 90% of cases of TD.\n\n【96】Other antibiotics used for prophylaxis include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline. However, both have limited efficacy because of increasing resistance of diarrheal pathogens worldwide.\n\n【97】Self-treatment of TD consists of fluid replacement, with or without use of an antibiotic, and an antimotility agent if needed. Fluid replacement is important, especially if the person has frequent episodes of diarrhea, is in hot climates, or has a fever. For mild diarrhea, drinking any fluids may be sufficient. However, for watery TD, fluids containing electrolytes and glucose are required. This can be accomplished by drinking water reconstituted with widely available oral rehydration salts approved by the World Health Organization. Proper use of loperamide should be explained to minimize the risk of complications developing with its use. Loperamide is effective for symptomatic relief of TD. For travelers with moderate diarrhea (4 to 5 stools a day, inability to participate in the planned activity), self-treatment using an antibiotic with loperamide is advised. However, those with severe diarrhea, ie, diarrhea associated with fever (temperature >38.3°C) or bloody stools, should be advised to take an antibiotic for 3 to 5 days without loperamide. Bloody diarrhea may represent shigella toxin-producing _E coli_ 0157 or shigellosis. In such situations, antimotility agents can be potentially harmful and are best avoided. Travelers with severe, persistent, or bloody diarrhea should seek care at a local medical facility for appropriate evaluation.\n\n【98】Fluoroquinolones are the most commonly used empirical self-treatment of TD. Antibiotics reduce the duration of diarrhea from 3 to 5 days to fewer than 1 to 2 days.\n\n【99】Practice guidelines for the management of infectious diarrhea.\n\n【100】Studies have shown that ciprofloxacin with loperamide is more effective than a 3-day course of ciprofloxacin alone and much more effective than a single dose of ciprofloxacin.\n\n【101】A single 750-mg dose of ciprofloxacin can be used for mild to moderate diarrhea. However, if TD continues, a 3- to 5-day course should be completed. Other fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, norfloxacin, or ofloxacin, can be used. Worldwide fluoroquinolone resistance among _Campylobacter, Salmonella_ , and _Shigella_ may result in the failure of empirical treatment. The best alternative to the fluoroquinolones for self-treatment of TD is azithromycin. In 2 clinical trials, azithromycin had 82% cure rates for multidrug-resistant _Shigella_ compared with 89% with ciprofloxacin.\n\n【102】For TD from other pathogens, azithromycin had a cure rate of 86% compared with 100% with ciprofloxacin. Azithromycin was more effective against _Campylobacter_ TD than ciprofloxacin (62% vs 48%).\n\n【103】Use of azithromycin for the treatment of _Campylobacter_ enteritis in travelers to Thailand, an area where ciprofloxacin resistance is prevalent.\n\n【104】Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, or oral cephalosporins have limited activity due to increasing antimicrobial resistance.\n\n【105】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【106】Although it has associated risks, travel to any part of the world can be safe with adequate pretravel preparation. The key to appropriate pretravel advice is to obtain details of the itinerary, review the medical history, and be aware of current recommendations. Special risk groups, such as pregnant women, immunocompromised hosts, small children, and elderly persons with medical problems, may require additional preparation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

More than 200,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States; approximately 40,000 patients die of the disease. The etiology of most breast cancer cases is unknown, although multiple factors predisposing to the disease have been identified. Apart from increasing age and female sex, these other factors account for only a minority of breast cancer diagnoses. This article provides an overview of the management of noninvasive and invasive breast cancer, which is often complex and varies according to patient factors, disease stage, and breast cancer subtype. Although much progress has been made, continued research endeavors are ongoing; enrollment of eligible patients in prospective clinical trials is an essential way to improve patient outcomes.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】AI ( aromatase inhibitor ), ASCO ( American Society of Clinical Oncology ), CDK4/6 ( cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 ), DCIS ( ductal carcinoma in situ ), DFS ( disease-free survival ), ER ( estrogen receptor ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), HER2 ( human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ), HR ( hormone receptor ), OS ( overall survival ), PFS ( progression-free survival ), PR ( progesterone receptor ), TNBC ( triple negative breast cancer )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Accreditation:** In support of improving patient care, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science is jointly accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE), and the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) to provide continuing education for the health care team.\n\n【6】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s).™ Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【7】**MOC Credit Statement:** Successful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1 MOC point in the American Board of Internal Medicine's (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program.

Mortality rates are influenced by the occurrence of the disease and the availability of screening programs and appropriate treatment. Despite lower breast cancer incidence, breast cancer mortality rates are higher in many low-income countries, for example, in sub–Saharan Africa, because of later stage at diagnosis, suboptimal access to treatment, more aggressive biological subtypes, and younger age at diagnosis.\n\n【14】Factors associated with an increased risk of breast cancer include older age, female sex, positive family history, deleterious gene sequence variations , increased mammographic breast density, reproductive factors (eg, nulliparity, early age at menarche, late age at menopause, and late age at first full-term pregnancy), a sedentary lifestyle, alcohol consumption, excess body weight (postmenopausal women), menopausal hormone therapy (combined estrogen- and progesterone-based treatments), and prior medical radiation therapy to the thorax, especially during childhood.\n\n【15】Prospective studies have also found an association between smoking and breast cancer.\n\n【16】Epidemiologic risk factors for in situ and invasive breast cancers among postmenopausal women in the National Institutes of Health–AARP Diet and Health Study.\n\n【17】Conversely, physical activity and breastfeeding are associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk.\n\n【18】Breast cancer can be classified by molecular and histopathological features. The most common histologic subtype comprising 80% to 85% of all invasive breast cancers is infiltrating ductal carcinoma. Infiltrating lobular carcinoma accounts for approximately 10% to 15% of cases, whereas other rarer histologic subtypes account for 1% or less.\n\n【19】Approximately 75% of patients with breast cancer have hormone receptor (HR)–positive disease, that is, estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) expression of 1% or more.\n\n【20】Endocrine therapy targeting ER is a fundamental component of treatment in both adjuvant and metastatic settings for these patients. Furthermore, 15% to 20% of breast cancers are human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–positive as determined by HER2 protein overexpression measured by immunohistochemistry or gene amplification measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization.\n\n【21】American Society of Clinical Oncology; College of American Pathologists  \nRecommendations for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 testing in breast cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists clinical practice guideline update.\n\n【22】Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 is 1 of 4 transmembrane human epidermal growth factor receptors belonging to the ErbB family involved in signal transduction pathways that mediate cell growth and differentiation. Tumors with overexpression/amplification of HER2 were associated with poor outcomes before the advent of the HER2-directed monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. Trastuzumab, typically administered in conjunction with chemotherapy, has dramatically improved disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) clinical outcomes.\n\n【23】Breast Cancer International Research Group  \nAdjuvant trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer.\n\n【24】Use of chemotherapy plus a monoclonal antibody against HER2 for metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.\n\n【25】Finally, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) describes tumors that do not express ER and PR and do not overexpress HER2. Triple negative breast cancer is heterogeneous in that it can be classified by several molecular subtypes with variable prognoses.\n\n【26】Identification of human triple-negative breast cancer subtypes and preclinical models for selection of targeted therapies.\n\n【27】The eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer breast cancer staging manual was clinically implemented in 2018. Notably, traditional tumor/node/metastasis anatomic staging was preserved; however, staging further incorporates prognostic biomarkers including tumor grade, ER, PR, HER2, and Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score. Breast cancer staging has now become quite complex with more than 150 combinations of anatomic and prognostic staging groups. The full citation can be referenced for complete staging information.\n\n【28】Landmark studies have classified breast cancer into at least 4 distinct intrinsic subtypes by molecular phenotype,\n\n【29】Molecular portraits of human breast tumours.\n\n【30】Gene expression patterns of breast carcinomas distinguish tumor subclasses with clinical implications.\n\n【31】for example, luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like. Luminal A and B breast carcinomas are positive for ER and/or PR expression. The luminal B subtype is distinguished by less prominent HR expression, higher rates of proliferation, and/or HER2/neu gene amplification.\n\n【32】Ki67 index, HER2 status, and prognosis of patients with luminal B breast cancer.\n\n【33】Tumors with the HER2-enriched phenotype are negative for ER and PR expression and positive for HER2 gene amplification. Most breast carcinomas belong to one of these groups, and therapies targeting these receptors are available.\n\n【34】The basal-like subtype, commonly negative for ER, PR, and HER2, is characterized by high expression of keratin 5, 6, and 17, higher frequency of p53 sequence variations, higher proliferative index, higher tumor grade, and worse prognosis. This subtype is most commonly seen in blacks.\n\n【35】Intrinsic breast tumor subtypes, race, and long-term survival in the Carolina Breast Cancer Study.\n\n【36】In addition, most patients with _BRCA1_ \\-mutant breast carcinomas fall into this subgroup.\n\n【37】Incidence and outcome of BRCA mutations in unselected patients with triple receptor-negative breast cancer.\n\n【38】Ductal Carcinoma In Situ\n------------------------\n\n【39】Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast refers to noninvasive lesions comprising malignant epithelial cells contained within the basal membrane of the terminal duct lobular units.\n\n【40】Since the clinical implementation and prominent use of screening mammography, there has been a sharp increase in the incidence of DCIS.\n\n【41】Current treatment trends and the need for better predictive tools in the management of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.\n\n【42】Ductal carcinoma in situ has variable outcomes in that approximately 40% of lesions never become clinically apparent if untreated whereas other precursor lesions progress to invasive disease.\n\n【43】The treatment approach for DCIS, although not well standardized, consists of surgery alone or combined with radiation therapy or endocrine therapy or both.\n\n【44】Surgery, the mainstay of care, can be either mastectomy or lumpectomy, depending on patient- and disease-specific factors.\n\n【45】Clear surgical margins are the goal, as this reduces the risk of recurrence by approximately 50%.\n\n【46】Society of Surgical Oncology-American Society for Radiation Oncology-American Society of Clinical Oncology Consensus Guideline on Margins for Breast-Conserving Surgery With Whole-Breast Irradiation in Ductal Carcinoma In Situ.\n\n【47】Sentinel lymph node surgery for axillary staging is often performed in patients at high risk for invasive disease upstaging (the discovery of invasive breast cancer when DCIS is surgically excised). Five randomized trials reported that adjuvant radiation therapy after lumpectomy reduces the risk of local recurrence by approximately 50%.\n\n【48】Effect of tamoxifen and radiotherapy in women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ: long-term results from the UK/ANZ DCIS trial.\n\n【49】EORTC Breast Cancer Cooperative Group EORTC Radiotherapy Group  \nBreast-conserving treatment with or without radiotherapy in ductal carcinoma-in-situ: ten-year results of European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer randomized phase III trial 10853—a study by the EORTC Breast Cancer Cooperative Group and EORTC Radiotherapy Group.\n\n【50】Swedish Breast Cancer Group  \nSweDCIS: radiotherapy after sector resection for ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast. Results of a randomised trial in a population offered mammography screening.\n\n【51】However, it is unclear whether adjuvant radiation therapy for DCIS is always required.\n\n【52】There is no role for radiation therapy after mastectomy. Approximately 60% and 75% of DCIS is ER-positive. In this setting, the selective estrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen, when administered for 5 years after lumpectomy and radiotherapy, reduces the relative risk of subsequent ipsilateral and contralateral cancer.\n\n【53】Adjuvant tamoxifen reduces subsequent breast cancer in women with estrogen receptor-positive ductal carcinoma in situ: a study based on NSABP protocol B-24.\n\n【54】The International Breast Cancer Intervention Study II (IBIS-II) study found that the aromatase inhibitor (AI) anastrozole was noninferior to tamoxifen in this adjuvant setting,\n\n【55】IBIS-II investigators  \nAnastrozole versus tamoxifen for the prevention of locoregional and contralateral breast cancer in postmenopausal women with locally excised ductal carcinoma in situ (IBIS-II DCIS): a double-blind, randomised controlled trial.\n\n【56】whereas in the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-35 (NSABP B-35) trial, anastrozole was more effective than tamoxifen in preventing recurrences in postmenopausal women 60 years and younger who had completed lumpectomy and radiation therapy.\n\n【57】Patient-reported outcomes with anastrozole versus tamoxifen for postmenopausal patients with ductal carcinoma in situ treated with lumpectomy plus radiotherapy (NSABP B-35): a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 clinical trial.\n\n【58】Outcomes were similar in those older than 60 years. As both radiation therapy and endocrine therapy may cause short- and long-term adverse effects, tailoring treatment is important, although challenging, given the difficulties in accurately identifying high-risk lesions. Although nomograms and molecular prognostic tools have been developed to aid risk stratification (eg, Memorial Sloan Kettering DCIS nomogram and Oncotype DX Breast DCIS score), these have limitations and are not routinely used in the clinic.\n\n【59】Current treatment trends and the need for better predictive tools in the management of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.\n\n【60】Current research is focused on developing better prognostic indices by integrating different types of predictive factors.\n\n【61】Operable Stage I to III Breast Cancer\n-------------------------------------\n\n【62】### Diagnostic Considerations\n\n【63】Invasive breast cancer is commonly detected on a screening mammogram.\n\n【64】Features worrisome for malignant tumor include a mass, architectural distortion, asymmetry, and microcalcifications, which require further work-up with a diagnostic mammogram, ultrasound, core needle biopsy, and sometimes breast magnetic resonance imaging. For persons who present with a palpable mass, the evaluation consists of a “triple assessment” of clinical examination, breast imaging (diagnostic mammography and ultrasound), and core needle biopsy. Systemic staging to evaluate for distant metastases is indicated only for patients with clinical stage III disease.\n\n【65】Baseline staging tests after a new diagnosis of breast cancer: further evidence of their limited indications.\n\n【66】The complexity and nuances of the breast cancer work-up are beyond the scope of the article, but are described in the referenced guidelines.\n\n【67】### Treatment Considerations\n\n【68】The treatment of breast cancer encompasses local treatment (ie, surgery, radiotherapy, or both) and systemic therapy.\n\n【69】#### Local-Regional Therapy Considerations\n\n【70】#### Breast and Axillary Surgery\n\n【71】Breast conservation is the preferred approach for most patients with breast cancer and is possible for an increasing number of patients with the advent of newer surgical techniques\n\n【72】Oncoplastic breast surgery in the setting of breast-conserving therapy: a systematic review.\n\n【73】and the use of preoperative systemic therapy.\n\n【74】However, the rates of patient-requested mastectomy, including contralateral prophylactic mastectomies, are increasing, although there is no evidence that this approach reduces breast cancer–related mortality.\n\n【75】The definition of a clear surgical margin was controversial for years, but the current consensus, since 2012, is “no ink on tumor.”\n\n【76】Intraoperative frozen section is increasingly available and improves surgical outcomes.\n\n【77】Since the late 1990s, sentinel lymph node surgery has replaced traditional axillary lymph node dissection and spares node-negative patients from the unnecessary morbidity associated with extensive axillary surgery.\n\n【78】NSABP-32: phase III, randomized trial comparing axillary resection with sentinal lymph node dissection: a description of the trial.\n\n【79】Patients with a clinically negative axilla (by examination and axillary imaging) at the time of presentation can undergo sentinel lymph node surgery after completion of systemic therapy with similar sentinel node identification and false-negative rates as observed when performed before systemic therapy.\n\n【80】Sentinel lymph node surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is accurate and reduces the need for axillary dissection in breast cancer patients.\n\n【81】The optimal surgical management of patients with a clinically positive axilla at diagnosis who complete a course of neoadjuvant systemic therapy remains under active investigation. Another vexing question is whether completion of axillary lymph node dissection can be avoided in selected patients who were clinically node-negative preoperatively but found to have a limited number of positive sentinel lymph nodes at surgery. The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 (ACOSOG Z0011) trial tested this and found no difference in OS in clinically node-negative patients who underwent lumpectomy and whole breast irradiation with no further axillary surgery compared with lymph node dissection.\n\n【82】Axillary dissection vs no axillary dissection in women with invasive breast cancer and sentinel node metastasis: a randomized clinical trial.\n\n【83】In the AMAROS (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer \\[EORTC\\] 10981-22023) trial, patients with primary breast tumor 3 cm or less in diameter and no palpable lymphadenopathy were randomized to axillary lymph node dissection or radiotherapy if a positive sentinel lymph node was detected. Both modalities provided excellent and comparable control for this patient population, although axillary radiotherapy was associated with considerably less morbidity.\n\n【84】Radiotherapy or surgery of the axilla after a positive sentinel node in breast cancer (EORTC 10981-22023 AMAROS): a randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 non-inferiority trial.\n\n【85】#### Reconstructive Surgery\n\n【86】Breast reconstruction can greatly improve quality of life for patients with breast cancer. Decision making with regard to the type of reconstruction pursued (prosthetic/implant, autologous tissue, or oncoplastic) depends on the type of surgery (lumpectomy vs radical, skin-sparing, or nipple-areola–sparing mastectomy) and the requirement for adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\n\n【87】Other relevant factors include the size and location of the tumor, lymph node status, physical characteristics, as well as patient comorbidities and expectations. As always, a multidisciplinary approach can facilitate optimal cosmetic and oncologic outcomes.\n\n【88】#### Radiation Therapy\n\n【89】Patients who undergo lumpectomy (also known as wide local excision) and those with high-risk disease postmastectomy (eg, tumor size >5 cm and positive lymph nodes) usually receive adjuvant radiation therapy.\n\n【90】Adjuvant radiotherapy for breast cancer often includes the axilla, and in high-risk patients, comprehensive nodal irradiation of the supraclavicular and parasternal regions may be included.\n\n【91】Currently, numerous strategies to de-escalate treatment are being explored; these aim to reduce toxicity and duration of treatment without compromising oncologic outcomes. Examples include hypofractionated radiotherapy, partial breast irradiation, and intraoperative radiotherapy.\n\n【92】Radiation therapy may be avoided in older patients with low-risk tumors. In the PRIME II (Breast-conserving surgery with or without irradiation in women aged 65 years or older with early breast cancer (PRIME II): a randomised controlled trial) study, women 65 years and older with HR-positive, node-negative tumors 3 cm or less in size, status post lumpectomy, and receiving endocrine therapy were allocated to no further treatment or whole breast irradiation. Adjuvant radiation therapy was associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in local recurrence; however, there were no differences in rates of distant metastasis or OS.\n\n【93】The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9343 trial involved women 70 years and older with stage I, ER-positive disease who were scheduled to receive adjuvant endocrine therapy; after lumpectomy, they were randomized to receive radiation therapy or not.\n\n【94】The use of hormone therapy alone versus hormone therapy and radiation therapy for breast cancer in elderly women: a population-based study.\n\n【95】Again, local recurrence rates at 10-year follow-up were slightly lower in the radiation therapy group, but breast cancer–specific or OS rates were comparable. Taken together, these findings support that radiation therapy may be avoided in selected older patients with low-risk tumors.\n\n【96】#### Systemic Therapy Considerations\n\n【97】Chemotherapy is a class of cytotoxic drugs that kills sensitive cancer cells. Its efficacy is correlated with the tumor proliferation rate. It can also kill normal rapidly dividing cells, which results in various adverse effects. Endocrine therapy stops or slows the growth of breast cancer by blocking the interaction of hormones, estrogen and progesterone, with tumor HRs. Biological therapies specifically target molecular components of tumor cell biology\n\n【98】(eg, the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab targets HER2), and they are either naturally occurring in the body or may be made in the laboratory. Some biological therapies harness the body's immune system to kill breast cancer cells. Targeted therapy is a newer cancer treatment classification that describes drugs that target specific molecules within oncogenic pathways or genetic aberrations. Because these therapies tend to be more selective for cancer cells, they usually result in fewer adverse effects.\n\n【99】The overarching goal of systemic therapy is to eliminate microscopic metastatic disease. Advances in systemic therapies have been associated with the continued improvements in breast cancer mortality over the past several decades. It may be administered preoperatively (neoadjuvant) or postoperatively (adjuvant). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy provides equivalent clinical outcomes as compared to the administration of the same regimen in the adjuvant setting. Neoadjuvant therapy can potentially downstage disease, facilitate breast conservation therapy, and reduce surgical morbidity. Furthermore, patients with TNBC or HER2-positive disease who achieve a _pathological complete response_ (defined as no residual breast cancer in the breast or axilla) have improved long-term clinical outcomes relative to those with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy.\n\n【100】Pathological complete response and long-term clinical benefit in breast cancer: the CTNeoBC pooled analysis.\n\n【101】Although the prognosis of patients with operable stage I to III breast cancer is favorable, the patterns of recurrence do vary by molecular subtype. In general, those with HR-negative disease are at higher risk of relapse than are patients with HR-positive disease. In addition, recurrence typically occurs within the first 5 years of treatment for patients with HR-negative disease, whereas recurrence can occur at any time, even decades after treatment, for patients with HR-positive disease.\n\n【102】#### Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative\n\n【103】For patients with operable HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, decisions about adjuvant systemic therapy (which can be given before surgery and/or after surgery) are made on the basis of the estimated risk of recurrence and the sensitivity to the proposed treatment, as well as patient comorbidities and preferences. Endocrine therapy, which targets the estradiol-ERα axis, is typically recommended for most individuals, unless they have an excellent prognosis and/or relevant contraindications; however, not all patients benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Traditionally, clinicopathologic features (eg, tumor size, grade, lymph node status, and presence of lymphovascular space invasion)\n\n【104】American Society of Clinical Oncology  \nUse of biomarkers to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy for women with early-stage invasive breast cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline.\n\n【105】Use of biomarkers to guide decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy for women with early-stage invasive breast cancer: American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline Focused Update.\n\n【106】Early results of prospective validation studies also support their prognostic and predictive value.\n\n【107】for the MINDACT Investigators  \n70-gene signature as an aid to treatment decisions in early-stage breast cancer.\n\n【108】Per the National Cancer Center Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines, Oncotype DX can be used for ER-positive, node-negative tumors; its use in patients with 1 to 3 positive axillary lymph nodes is controversial, though commonly used.\n\n【109】Selection of optimal adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)—negative and adjuvant targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancers: an American Society of Clinical Oncology Guideline Adaptation of the Cancer Care Ontario Clinical Practice Guideline.\n\n【110】When choosing an adjuvant chemotherapy regimen, one must consider the baseline recurrence risk, toxicity profiles, likelihood of benefit, and patient comorbidities.\n\n【111】Selection of optimal adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)—negative and adjuvant targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancers: an American Society of Clinical Oncology Guideline Adaptation of the Cancer Care Ontario Clinical Practice Guideline.\n\n【112】Standard chemotherapy regimens for HER2-negative breast cancer include anthracycline- and/or taxane-based regimens (eg, doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide followed or preceded by paclitaxel)\n\n【113】Weekly paclitaxel in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer.\n\n【114】Randomized trial of dose-dense versus conventionally scheduled and sequential versus concurrent combination chemotherapy as postoperative adjuvant treatment of node-positive primary breast cancer: first report of Intergroup Trial C9741/Cancer and Leukemia Group B Trial 9741.\n\n【115】or 4 cycles of docetaxel/cyclophosphamide).\n\n【116】Phase III trial comparing doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide with docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide as adjuvant therapy for operable breast cancer.\n\n【117】In patients with high-risk HER2-negative disease with an excellent performance status, anthracycline- and taxane-based regimens are preferred. Given concerns about the rare, irreversible long-term toxicities of anthracyclines (cardiac failure, myelodysplastic syndromes, and acute myeloid leukemia), carefully selecting patients who do not require these agents is important. A recent joint analysis confirmed the benefit of anthracycline combined with taxane-based chemotherapy in patients with high-risk node-positive disease.\n\n【118】Anthracyclines in early breast cancer: the ABC Trials-USOR 06-090, NSABP B-46-I/USOR 07132, and NSABP B-49 (NRG Oncology).\n\n【119】However, in patients with node-negative breast cancer, adjuvant anthracyclines did not confer additional benefit beyond taxane-based chemotherapy.\n\n【120】Recommendations for adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer include 5 years of tamoxifen for patients with low-risk disease and 10 years of tamoxifen for higher-risk patients.\n\n【121】Adjuvant Tamoxifen: Longer Against Shorter (ATLAS) Collaborative Group  \nLong-term effects of continuing adjuvant tamoxifen to 10 years versus stopping at 5 years after diagnosis of oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer: ATLAS, a randomised trial.\n\n【122】Based on the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT) and Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial (TEXT) studies, tamoxifen or an AI combined with ovarian function suppression for 5 years is an option in women 35 years and younger and/or with high-risk disease.\n\n【123】TEXT and SOFT Investigators International Breast Cancer Study Group  \nAdjuvant exemestane with ovarian suppression in premenopausal breast cancer.\n\n【124】In postmenopausal women, options for adjuvant endocrine therapy include 5 to 10 years of tamoxifen (eg, a shorter duration for women with lower-risk, node-negative disease) or 5 to 10 years of an AI. Extended endocrine therapy beyond the initial 5 years is an approach that can be considered for high-risk patients who have tolerated endocrine therapy well for the first 5 years.\n\n【125】Given that AIs are superior to tamoxifen in terms of DFS outcomes,\n\n【126】Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 Collaborative Group  \nA comparison of letrozole and tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.\n\n【127】switching approaches may also be used,\n\n【128】Patterns and reasons for switching classes of hormonal therapy among women with early-stage breast cancer.\n\n【129】for example, tamoxifen or AI for 2 to 5 years, followed by a switch to the other for 2 to 5 years to complete a total of 5 to 10 years. For patients with stage II or III disease, trials investigating endocrine therapy combined with novel therapies that target mechanisms of endocrine resistance are ongoing. The adverse effect profiles of tamoxifen and AIs differ, as illustrated in the Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination trial. In this study, compared with tamoxifen, anastrozole was associated with a significantly reduced incidence of endometrial cancer, vaginal bleeding and discharge, hot flashes, venous thromboembolic events, and cerebrovascular events. Conversely, tamoxifen was associated with a lower incidence of musculoskeletal issues and fractures as compared with anastrozole.\n\n【130】ATAC Trialists' Group  \nAnastrozole alone or in combination with tamoxifen versus tamoxifen alone for adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer: first results of the ATAC randomised trial.\n\n【131】#### HER2-Positive\n\n【132】Standard adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer involves chemotherapy and 1 year of trastuzumab. Endocrine therapy is recommended after completion of chemotherapy for patients who are also HR-positive. For patients with high-risk disease, 4 cycles of anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed or preceded by 12 weeks of concurrent administration of trastuzumab and taxane, or the combination of docetaxel, carboplatin, and trastuzumab for 6 cycles, are commonly used options.\n\n【133】Selection of optimal adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)—negative and adjuvant targeted therapy for HER2-positive breast cancers: an American Society of Clinical Oncology Guideline Adaptation of the Cancer Care Ontario Clinical Practice Guideline.\n\n【134】In a meta-analysis of 8 prospective randomized controlled trials (n=11,991), adjuvant chemotherapy with trastuzumab significantly improved DFS and OS ( _P_ <.00001), with relative risk reductions of 50% and 40%, respectively.\n\n【135】Trastuzumab containing regimens for early breast cancer.\n\n【136】The optimal use of adjuvant anthracyclines in HER2-positive disease is an ongoing topic of debate. Most of the adjuvant trastuzumab trials did not include patients with tumors 1 cm or less in size and negative lymph nodes; therefore, the management of small node-negative HER2-positive breast cancers is also controversial. The general recommendation is that patients with tumors greater than 0.5 cm in size, especially with adverse biological features such as lymphovascular space invasion, HR-negative status, and/or grade III histology, should be considered for treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab.\n\n【137】Efficacy of adjuvant trastuzumab for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive early breast cancer and tumors ≤2 cm: a meta-analysis of the randomized trastuzumab trials.\n\n【138】Data from the adjuvant trastuzumab trials suggest that the incidence of asymptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction decline ranges from 4.1% to 30.1% during or after trastuzumab therapy, but the rates of symptomatic congestive heart failure are much lower, ranging from 0.6% to 3.8%.\n\n【139】Cardiac outcomes of patients receiving adjuvant weekly paclitaxel and trastuzumab for node-negative, ERBB2-positive breast cancer.\n\n【140】Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) Trial Study Team  \n11 years' follow-up of trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive early breast cancer: final analysis of the HERceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.\n\n【141】Seven-year follow-up assessment of cardiac function in NSABP B-31, a randomized trial comparing doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (ACP) with ACP plus trastuzumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with node-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer.\n\n【142】Unlike anthracycline-associated cardiac toxicity, trastuzumab-associated cardiomyopathy is usually reversible with discontinuation of treatment. Given concerns about chemotherapy-related toxicities, attempts at cautious therapy de-escalation are ongoing. The results of the Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab trial strongly support that 12 weekly doses of paclitaxel and trastuzumab, followed by trastuzumab monotherapy to complete 1 year of treatment, are highly effective for patients with node-negative tumors less than 3 cm in size.\n\n【143】Adjuvant paclitaxel and trastuzumab for node-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer.\n\n【144】Given the development of novel agents targeting HER2, trials evaluating dual HER2-directed therapy for adjuvant treatment were conducted. In the Adjuvant Lapatinib And/Or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimisation Study (ALTTO), the combination of trastuzumab with the oral epidermal growth factor receptor/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib was not found to be better than trastuzumab monotherapy.\n\n【145】Adjuvant lapatinib and trastuzumab for early human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: results from the randomized phase III Adjuvant Lapatinib and/or Trastuzumab Treatment Optimization trial.\n\n【146】In the APHINITY (A Study of Pertuzumab in Addition to Chemotherapy and Trastuzumab as Adjuvant Therapy in Participants With Human Epidermal Growth Receptor 2 (HER2)-Positive Primary Breast Cancer) trial, 4805 patients were randomized to adjuvant chemotherapy and trastuzumab with placebo or the HER2 monoclonal antibody pertuzumab that inhibits receptor dimerization. Although the study found a significant improvement in 3-year invasive DFS (93.1% with placebo vs 94.2% with pertuzumab; _P_ \\=.045), the relatively small absolute benefit of adding pertuzumab to trastuzumab needs to be weighed against the additional toxicity (increased diarrhea, rash, etc), longer treatment sessions, and increased costs when making adjuvant treatment decisions.\n\n【147】#### Hormone Receptor-Negative, HER2-Negative\n\n【148】There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved targeted therapies for TNBC; therefore, chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment. Adjuvant therapy is not generally recommended for node-negative tumors 0.5 cm or less in size, but 4 cycles of docetaxel/cyclophosphamide can be considered for tumors 0.6 to 1.0 cm in size if adverse pathological factors are present. Anthracycline combined with taxane-based therapy is often used in patients with tumors greater than 2 cm in size and/or positive lymph nodes.\n\n【149】Anthracyclines in early breast cancer: the ABC Trials-USOR 06-090, NSABP B-46-I/USOR 07132, and NSABP B-49 (NRG Oncology).\n\n【150】In the Capecitabine for Residual Cancer as Adjuvant Therapy (CREATE-X) trial, 24-week adjuvant therapy with the oral antimetabolite capecitabine was compared with no additional therapy in women with HER2-negative breast cancer who had residual disease in the breast and/or axilla after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Capecitabine was associated with a statistically significant survival advantage, notably in patients with HR-negative disease, and it is an option for selected patients.\n\n【151】Adjuvant capecitabine for breast cancer after preoperative chemotherapy.\n\n【152】Furthermore, clinical trials are ongoing to assess the role of immunotherapy and/or targeted therapies in the adjuvant setting.\n\n【153】#### Bone-Modifying Agents\n\n【154】Adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy should be considered for postmenopausal patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer if they are candidates for systemic therapy and there are no relevant patient comorbidities.\n\n【155】Use of adjuvant bisphosphonates and other bone-modifying agents in breast cancer: a Cancer Care Ontario and American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline.\n\n【156】This recommendation is based on bone preservation reasons as AIs can reduce bone mineral density, as can ovarian function suppression or therapeutic salpingo-oophorectomy in premenopausal women. Furthermore, a large meta-analysis has revealed that specific bisphosphonates (intravenous zoledronic acid and oral clodronate) decrease recurrent breast cancer risk (primarily risk of bone metastasis) and improve OS.\n\n【157】Adjuvant bisphosphonates in early breast cancer: consensus guidance for clinical practice from a European panel.\n\n【158】Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group, Vienna, Austria  \nAdjuvant endocrine therapy plus zoledronic acid in premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer: 62-month follow-up from the ABCSG-12 randomised trial.\n\n【159】The ASCO guidelines recommend adjuvant bisphosphonates as standard of care for postmenopausal patients (by natural menopause or ovarian function suppression or ovarian ablation) who are candidates for adjuvant endocrine therapy, regardless of bone mineral density.\n\n【160】Use of adjuvant bisphosphonates and other bone-modifying agents in breast cancer: a Cancer Care Ontario and American Society of Clinical Oncology Clinical Practice Guideline.\n\n【161】Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group, Vienna, Austria  \nAdjuvant endocrine therapy plus zoledronic acid in premenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer: 62-month follow-up from the ABCSG-12 randomised trial.\n\n【162】Based on the results of the ABCSG-18 trial,\n\n【163】Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group  \nAdjuvant denosumab in breast cancer (ABCSG-18): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\n\n【164】denosumab may also be considered as an alternative, though it is not endorsed by ASCO guidelines, as its effect on clinical outcomes remains to be defined.\n\n【165】Metastatic Breast Cancer\n------------------------\n\n【166】With rare exception, patients with metastatic breast cancer cannot be cured of their disease. The goals of care are 4-fold, and they should be focused on patients having (1) the fewest symptoms or complications of their cancer, (2) the fewest adverse effects of cancer treatment, (3) the longest possible life, and (4) the best quality of life. Given that metastatic breast cancer is a systemic disease, locoregional therapy with surgery and/or radiation is used only for palliative intent. Systemic therapy is the mainstay of treatment, and an overview of treatment options based on molecular subtype is presented in the Table .\n\n【167】Table Systemic Treatment Options for Stage IV Breast Cancer\n\n【168】CDK4/6 = cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6; GnRH = gonadotropin-releasing hormone; HER2 = human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; HR = hormone receptor; mTOR = mechanistic target or rapamycin; PARP = poly(ADP ribose) polymerase.\n\n| HR status | HER2 status | Other characteristics | Systemic treatment optionsbClinical trials should be considered for all lines of therapy, regardless of tumor molecular subtype. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Positive | Negative |  | • Ovarian ablation or ovarian suppression (GnRH analog and goserelin)cFor premenopausal patients, ovarian ablation or suppression may be combined with tamoxifen, but it is required when combined with an aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant, and/or targeted agents (CDK4/6 or mTOR inhibitors).• Aromatase inhibitor (letrozole, anastrozole, and exemestane)• Tamoxifen• Fulvestrant• CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib, or abemaciclib) plus endocrine therapy• Abemaciclib (monotherapy)• mTOR inhibitor (everolimus) plus endocrine therapy• Sequential single-agent chemotherapy (eg, doxorubicin/epirubicin, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, docetaxel, eribulin, capecitabine, gemcitabine, vinorelbine, carboplatin, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and ixabepilone) |\n|  |  | Visceral crisis | • Combination chemotherapy |\n| Any | Positive |  | • Trastuzumab plus pertuzumab plus taxane-based chemotherapy• Ado-trastuzumab emtansine• Trastuzumab plus lapatinib• Lapatinib plus capecitabine• Trastuzumab plus chemotherapy |\n| Positive | Positive |  | • Trastuzumab plus endocrine therapy |\n| Negative | Negative |  | • Sequential single-agent chemotherapy |\n|  |  | Visceral crisis | • Combination chemotherapy |\n| Any | Negative | Germline sequence variation in _BRCA1_ or _BRCA2_ | • PARP inhibitorsdSeveral Food and Drug Administration–registered clinical trials with PARP inhibitors are completed or in progress for treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with a germline sequence variation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. |\n| Any | Any | Bone metastases; supportive care | • Bisphosphonates (zoledronic acid and pamidronate)• Denosumab | a CDK4/6 = cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6; GnRH = gonadotropin-releasing hormone; HER2 = human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; HR = hormone receptor; mTOR = mechanistic target or rapamycin; PARP = poly(ADP ribose) polymerase.\n\n【170】b Clinical trials should be considered for all lines of therapy, regardless of tumor molecular subtype.\n\n【171】c For premenopausal patients, ovarian ablation or suppression may be combined with tamoxifen, but it is required when combined with an aromatase inhibitor, fulvestrant, and/or targeted agents (CDK4/6 or mTOR inhibitors).\n\n【172】d Several Food and Drug Administration–registered clinical trials with PARP inhibitors are completed or in progress for treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with a germline sequence variation in _BRCA1_ or _BRCA2_ .\n\n【173】### Hormone Receptor-Positive, HER2-Negative\n\n【174】An increasing number of therapeutic options are available for patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. In the absence of a visceral crisis, endocrine-based regimens are preferred as first-line therapy over chemotherapy, given the efficacy of this approach and the more favorable toxicity profile.\n\n【175】Chemotherapy versus endocrine therapy as first-line treatment in patients with luminal-like HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer: a propensity score analysis.\n\n【176】As for all patients with breast cancer who relapse after adjuvant therapy, reassessing tumor ER, PR, and HER2 status is important to guide further treatment. Traditionally, AI monotherapy was the standard approach for most patients with postmenopausal HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer. However, the advent of the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors (eg, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) has been practice changing on the basis of the results of phase III trials showing a near doubling of progression-free survival (PFS) and a 10-month absolute PFS benefit when letrozole was combined with palbociclib (PALOMA-2 删除20:<u>\\[A Study of Palbociclib (PD-0332991) + Letrozole vs. Letrozole For 1st Line Treatment Of Postmenopausal Women With ER+/HER2- Advanced Breast Cancer\\]</u>)\n\n【177】Palbociclib and letrozole in advanced breast cancer.\n\n【178】or ribociclib (MONALEESA-2 \\[Study of Efficacy and Safety of Ribociclib (LEE011) in Postmenopausal Women With Advanced Breast Cancer\\]) as first-line therapy.\n\n【179】Ribociclib as first-line therapy for HR-positive, advanced breast cancer.\n\n【180】Furthermore, adding abemaciclib to letrozole or anastrozole improved PFS as compared with letrozole or anastrozole alone in women with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer enrolled in the phase III MONARCH 3 (A Study of Nonsteroidal Aromatase Inhibitors Plus Abemaciclib (LY2835219) in Postmenopausal Women With Breast Cancer) study; however, at the time of writing, FDA approval has not been granted for this indication. To date, the addition of a CDK4/6 inhibitor to endocrine therapy has not shown an improvement in OS. This is important, as CDK4/6 inhibitors are expensive and their use can result in significant patient inconvenience (ie, extra clinical visits and blood draws to monitor hematologic toxicities). Because many patients can do well for years when treated with endocrine therapy alone, not all patients need a CDK4/6 inhibitor as a part of first-line endocrine therapy, and the decision should be individualized for each patient. Notably, because premenopausal women were not included in PALOMA-2 and MONALEESA-2 trials, the use of CDK4/6 inhibitors in this setting is undefined; studies to assess their additional benefit in these patients are in progress. For the small number of postmenopausal women who have not received prior endocrine therapy or have de novo metastatic breast cancer, the FALCON (A Global Study to Compare the Effects of Fulvestrant and Arimidex in a Subset of Patients With Breast Cancer) trial reported that the selective estrogen receptor downregulator fulvestrant improved PFS in comparison to patients who received anastrozole.\n\n【181】Fulvestrant 500 mg versus anastrozole 1 mg for hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer (FALCON): an international, randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial.\n\n【182】It may be considered for first-line therapy in this specific patient population.\n\n【183】After disease progression, there are a number of other endocrine therapy–based options that can be used in the second-line setting and beyond. Commonly used agents include nonsteroidal AIs (anastrozole or letrozole), the steroidal AI, exemestane, tamoxifen, and fulvestrant. If a CDK4/6 inhibitor had not been previously administered, it may be used with one of these other endocrine agents. Alternatively, the mechanistic target or rapamycin inhibitor everolimus that targets a common pathway of endocrine resistance can be combined with one of these endocrine agents on the basis of trials showing an improvement in PFS over endocrine monotherapy.\n\n【184】Everolimus in postmenopausal hormone-receptor-positive advanced breast cancer.\n\n【185】Randomized phase II trial of everolimus in combination with tamoxifen in patients with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer with prior exposure to aromatase inhibitors: a GINECO study.\n\n【186】After the aforementioned options have been used, the following additional hormonal treatment options can be considered: megestrol acetate, fluoxymesterone, and high dose of estradiol.\n\n【187】Activity of megestrol acetate in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer after nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor failure: a phase II trial.\n\n【188】Patients with HR-positive metastatic breast cancer can often be treated for years (or sometimes decades) with these therapeutic options while maintaining a good quality of life. If patients have been receiving various hormonal therapy agents for a long period of time, sometimes previously used drugs can be reused with beneficial results. In addition, hormone withdrawal treatment maneuvers can lead to tumor regression.\n\n【189】Commonly, chemotherapy is recommended after options for endocrine therapy have been exhausted; however, for patients with severe symptoms and/or an impending visceral crisis, systemic chemotherapy may be preferred. Sequential single-agent chemotherapy is often sufficient and preferred on the basis of meta-analyses showing similar OS outcomes when this approach is compared with combination chemotherapy; however, response rates are higher with combination chemotherapy and this approach may be warranted in patients with severe symptoms and/or an impending visceral crisis. Because there is no clear information as to the best sequence of chemotherapy agents, selecting treatment regimens according to patient preferences in terms of schedule, toxicities, and route of administration is advised.\n\n【190】### HER2-Positive\n\n【191】Trastuzumab has dramatically improved patient outcomes since its FDA approval for use in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.\n\n【192】However, approximately 35% of patients do not respond to trastuzumab (primary resistance) and approximately 70% become resistant within 1 year (secondary resistance).\n\n【193】Trastuzumab combined with taxane-based chemotherapy (docetaxel or paclitaxel) had been standard first-line therapy for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer for many years.\n\n【194】Use of chemotherapy plus a monoclonal antibody against HER2 for metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2.\n\n【195】In the past decade, 3 additional HER2-directed therapies have been approved for use in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer: lapatinib, pertuzumab, and the antibody-drug conjugate ado-trastuzumab emtansine.\n\n【196】The discovery that continuing trastuzumab beyond disease progression could still confer clinical benefit was an important clinical advance.\n\n【197】Trastuzumab beyond progression in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive advanced breast cancer: a german breast group 26/breast international group 03-05 study.\n\n【198】A subsequent pioneering trial randomized women previously treated with anthracycline, taxane, and trastuzumab to capecitabine alone or combined with lapatinib.

All these trials support that it is beneficial to continue some form of HER2-directed therapy after disease progression. This is often done in combination with sequential chemotherapy agents or endocrine therapy for those patients with HR-positive disease.\n\n【203】In the CLEOPATRA (A Study to Evaluate Pertuzumab + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel vs. Placebo + Trastuzumab + Docetaxel in Previously Untreated HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer) trial, patients were randomized to first-line treatment with docetaxel, trastuzumab, and placebo/pertuzumab.\n\n【204】CLEOPATRA Study Group  \nPertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.\n\n【205】The median OS in the pertuzumab arm was 56.5 months as compared with 40 months in the placebo arm. Despite an increase in diarrhea, mucositis, and rash, no additional cardiotoxicity was noted for those receiving dual HER2-targeted therapy compared with trastuzumab monotherapy. This trial has defined this regimen as ASCO guideline–recommended first-line therapy for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.\n\n【206】Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (CLEOPATRA study): overall survival results from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study.\n\n【207】Ado-trastuzumab emtansine was shown to be superior to the combination of capecitabine and lapatinib in patients previously treated with trastuzumab plus taxane-based chemotherapy.\n\n【208】EMILIA Study Group  \nTrastuzumab emtansine for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.\n\n【209】It is therefore commonly recommended as a second-line treatment.\n\n【210】Overall, treatment options for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer have continued to improve with further advances in HER2-directed therapy, and the median OS is approaching 5 years.\n\n【211】Despite these advances, the identification and investigation of newer and more effective therapies, notably those used to reverse resistance to HER2-directed therapies, remain a critical need. One vexing problem that is in need of improved therapies is the high incidence of HER2-positive central nervous system metastases. With the improved management of systemic disease, up to half of patients will develop brain metastases and/or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.\n\n【212】### Hormone Receptor-Negative, HER2-Negative\n\n【213】The median OS for patients diagnosed with metastatic TNBC is approximately 11 months; therefore, better treatments are urgently needed.\n\n【214】Currently, the only FDA-approved option for management is systemic chemotherapy. The use of sequential single agents is generally preferred, as opposed to using combined chemotherapy. Options include taxanes, platinum-based compounds, vinca alkaloids, antimetabolites, and other antitubulins (eg, eribulin). There is no “best” agent, although response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy are higher than seen when platinum-based chemotherapy is used in patients with HR-positive breast cancer.\n\n【215】Participation in a clinical trial should be considered for all patients with metastatic TNBC who have a good performance status. Targeted therapies under study include the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, androgen receptor antagonists, and immunotherapies, either as monotherapy or in combination with other standard or investigational agents.\n\n【216】Olaparib for metastatic breast cancer in patients with a germline _BRCA_ mutation.\n\n【217】Supportive Care\n---------------\n\n【218】Patients with breast cancer experience many challenges during their treatment journey that spans diagnosis, treatment, recovery, and surveillance.\n\n【219】A holistic approach to patient care is important, given that overall well-being is related to how well the physical, social, financial, emotional, psychological, and spiritual needs of the patient are addressed. Each patient has unique needs, which should continually be reassessed throughout the course of the disease trajectory; the use of a multidisciplinary team is ideal.\n\n【220】Health care professionals must effectively address the vast array of potential physical adverse effects due to surgery (lymphedema, reduced arm/shoulder mobility, and body image concerns), chemotherapy (nausea, alopecia, infections, neuropathy, and mucositis), endocrine therapy (arthralgias, hot flashes, and vaginal dryness), and radiotherapy (fatigue and skin toxicity). Furthermore, attention to potential late and/or long-term toxicities such as osteopenia/osteoporosis, infertility, premature menopause, cardiac dysfunction, and cognitive impairment is essential.\n\n【221】Patients can greatly benefit from targeted exercise programs, lifestyle modifications, integrative approaches, and psychological and social support.\n\n【222】Given that patients with metastatic breast cancer often have unique issues and concerns, there are dedicated support groups for these patients.\n\n【223】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【224】The evaluation and management of DCIS and invasive breast cancer is complex, and numerous diagnostic and treatment options are available. Effective communication between the oncologist, the patient, his or her caregivers, and the multidisciplinary team is essential to provide quality patient care. Minimizing treatment-related toxicities and improving treatment efficacy are key to maintain—and improve—quality of life for patients with breast cancer.

Holley, Har Gobind Khorana (1922-), and Marshall W. Nirenberg (1927-), for research that helped to explain how genetic components of the cell nucleus control the synthesis of proteins. Holley was the first scientist to determine exactly the internal structure of a strand of one of the nucleic acids that helps build protein in living cells according to a genetic master plan. He developed techniques for determining the structure of nucleic acids and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of alanine transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA). Khorana, working at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, developed methods for investigating the structure of nucleic acids and provided the codons (sequences of nucleotides that code for amino acids) for several amino acids. Nirenberg, working at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md, developed the procedure for deciphering the genetic code in living cells. The work of these 3 laureates contributed substantially to the understanding of genetic mechanisms and protein synthesis.\n\n【1】Holley was born on January 28, 1922, in Urbana, Ill. Both his parents were schoolteachers. He received his early education in the public school systems of Illinois, California, and Idaho. After graduating from Urbana High School in 1938, he entered the University of Illinois at Urbana and received a BA degree in chemistry in 1942.\n\n【2】During World War II, Holley joined the US Office of Research and Development and worked at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. He was part of the team that, from 1944 to 1946, first synthesized penicillin. After the war, he was appointed a National Research Council Fellow at Cornell University and completed his formal education there, receiving his PhD degree in biochemistry in 1947.\n\n【3】After receiving his doctorate, Holley was awarded a fellowship from the American Chemical Society, which enabled him to spend 1 year (1947-1948) doing postdoctoral research at Washington State College in Pullman. In 1948, he returned to Cornell University as an assistant professor of organic chemistry, doing research at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, a branch of Cornell University located in Geneva, NY. In 1957, he was appointed research chemist at the US Plant, Soil, and Nutrition Laboratory at Cornell University, and in 1964, he was promoted to professor of biochemistry and named chairman of the department. During these years, he began to study the biochemistry of the nucleic acids. Except for a sabbatical leave, Holley remained at Cornell University from 1948 to 1966.\n\n【4】In 1966, Holley was awarded a National Science Foundation Fellowship and spent a year doing research at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif. In 1968, Holley was named American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology and was a resident fellow at the Salk Institute. In 1969, he was named adjunct professor of the University of California at San Diego.\n\n【5】Holley was granted a 1-year sabbatical from Cornell University in 1955 to work at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena as a Guggenheim Fellow doing research with biochemist and molecular biologist James Frederick Bonner (1910-1996). Holley began his prize-winning work at Caltech in 1955-1956 and completed it as a research chemist at Cornell University. He returned to Cornell University in 1957 and spent 3 years isolating 1 g of alanine tRNA from 90 kg of yeast. On March 19, 1965, Holley and colleagues announced in _Science_ that they had identified the complete sequence of 77 nucleotides of alanine tRNA. They had determined the composition of tRNA that incorporates the amino acid alanine into protein molecules. This feat-the first determination of the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid- required digesting the molecules with enzymes, identifying the pieces, and figuring out how they fit together. Since that work, all tRNAs have been shown to have a similar structure.\n\n【6】Holley died of lung cancer on February 11, 1993, at the age of 71 years in Los Gatos, about 8 miles southwest of San Jose, Calif. Besides the Nobel Prize, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Award of the US Department of Agriculture (1965), the Lasker Award (1965), and the US Steel Foundation Award of the National Academy of Sciences (1967).

{"seq_id": "546b6300-363e-4179-89b3-eb0f9a9173c1", "title": "37-Year-Old Man With Painful Foot", "text": "【0】37-Year-Old Man With Painful Foot\n**A** 37-year-old Asian man was admitted to a general medicine service at Saint Marys Hospital, a Mayo Clinic-affiliated hospital in Rochester, MN, with a painful foot. He had a 10-week history of worsening pain in his left toes. His mother was present during the initial history taking and reported progressive blackening of the third and fourth toes during the past 4 weeks. Four days before admission, a physician at a hospital elsewhere noted a pustule on the base of the third toe and erythema of the foot and initiated ciprofloxacin therapy. On admission, the patient rated the pain in his left foot as an 8 on a 10-point scale; he was able to obtain substantial pain relief through dependent positioning. He had been healthy until age 29 years, at which time he noted right foot numbness while playing tennis. At that time, lower-extremity arterial thrombi of unclear etiology were noted, and the patient underwent right anterior tibial and bilateral femoral artery thrombectomy. Surgical details were not readily available; however, the patient stated that after surgery he started taking the phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol (for lower extremity claudication) and began receiving long-term warfarin therapy with excellent international normalized ratio control.\n\n【1】*   1.\n\n【2】    _Given the initial history and findings on examination, which one of the following admitting diagnoses is least likely?_\n\n【3】    *   a.\n\n【4】        _Diabetes mellitus_\n\n【5】    *   b.\n\n【6】        _Warfarin-induced necrosis_\n\n【7】    *   c.\n\n【8】        _Primary vasculitic disease_\n\n【9】    *   d.\n\n【10】        _Embolic disease_\n\n【11】    *   e.\n\n【12】        _Traumatic injury_\n\n【13】Given the limited history, the admission differential should be kept broad. Diabetes mellitus should be investigated as an etiology because it is a common cause of foot ulcers and necrotic digits. Ulceration in diabetes is secondary to a mixture of ischemic and neuropathic components. Warfarin-induced necrosis, a rare adverse reaction, is most common in the first few days of warfarin therapy and is associated with administration of a large initial dose of the drug.\n\n【14】The patient's long-term warfarin therapy and well-controlled international normalized ratio make this the least likely diagnosis. Primary vasculitic diseases, such as giant cell arteritis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, thromboangiitis obliterans, and polyarteritis nodosa, are causes of arterial insufficiency and would be consistent with the findings in this patient. Also supportive of arterial insufficiency was the pain relief achieved while the limb was in a dependent position. Embolic disease can cause distal ischemia, and embolic sources, such as those associated with atherosclerosis, should be further investigated. Traumatic injury should also be included in the admitting differential, especially given that a previous event occurred during exercise.\n\n【15】Further history was obtained to focus the differential diagnosis. The patient denied recent trauma to the lower extremities, fever, chills, and rigors and stated that he otherwise felt well. Other than ciprofloxacin, cilostazol, and warfarin, his only medications were ibuprofen and oxycodone-acetaminophen as needed for pain. The patient had a 15-pack-year smoking history but denied smoking since his numbness when he was age 29 years. He denied any other remarkable medical history relevant to this case.\n\n【16】On admission, the patient had a temperature of 37.2ϒC, blood pressure of 121/79 mm Hg, and a pulse of 78 beats/min. On examination, he appeared athletic and in no distress. Findings on cardiac and pulmonary examinations were normal. Radial pulses were strong and symmetric. The feet were warm, but posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were absent bilaterally. Nonpitting edema (2+) was noted on the left side of the foot, extending to the ankle. Ulceration is depicted in Figure 1 . The patient preferred the dependent position for his left foot and was unable to elevate it for more than a minute without severe pain. No duskiness was noted. His foot displayed a well-demarcated area of erythema with associated warmth and swelling, consistent with cellulitis. According to the patient, these changes were not resolving.\n\n【17】*   2.\n\n【18】    _On hospital admission, which one of the following antimicrobial medications would be most appropriate?_\n\n【19】    *   a.\n\n【20】        _Ciprofloxacin (continued)_\n\n【21】    *   b.\n\n【22】        _Cefazolin_\n\n【23】    *   c.\n\n【24】        _Piperacillin-tazobactam_\n\n【25】    *   d.\n\n【26】        _Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin_\n\n【27】    *   e.\n\n【28】        _Piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and fluconazole_\n\n【29】FIGURE 1 Patient's left foot, showing blackening of the third and fourth toes.\n\n【30】To prevent worsening of disease while further evaluation and diagnostic tests are performed, appropriate choice of antimicrobial medication is crucial. Given the progression of the patient's foot infection despite 4 days of ciprofloxacin therapy, antibiotic coverage should be broadened. Furthermore, continued fluoroquinolone use could complicate anticoagulation management. Cefazolin is often used for cellulitis because of its excellent gram-positive coverage; however, it does not provide the broad-spectrum coverage needed in this case for potential polymicrobial infection. Furthermore, severe foot infections require pseudomonal coverage. Piperacillin-tazobactam provides excellent gram-positive, anaerobic, and gram-negative coverage, including _Pseudomonas_ species. However, given the severity of the infection and the increasing prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus,_ vancomycin is also warranted. Because this patient has no evidence of compromised immunity or specific features to suggest a fungal infection, antifungal coverage with fluconazole is unnecessary.\n\n【31】Findings on blood cultures, drawn at admission, were negative after 5 days. On the basis of the appearance of the foot, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate for osteomyelitis. The patient was initially unable to keep his leg elevated for the scan because of pain and required sedation to tolerate the imaging study. Results were worrisome, suggesting osteomyelitis. Further medical evaluation consisted of screening for common causes of vascular insufficiency. Findings on evaluation for diabetes were unremarkable. An autoimmune disease assessment (antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, antiphospholipid antibodies, cryoglobulins, and hepatitis screen) and coagulopathy evaluation (protein C and S levels, activated protein C resistance, and prothrombin mutations) yielded negative results. The patient's serum homocysteine level was not checked.\n\n【32】*   3.\n\n【33】    _Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation and management?_\n\n【34】    *   a.\n\n【35】        _Amputation of the foot_\n\n【36】    *   b.\n\n【37】        _Sural nerve biopsy_\n\n【38】    *   c.\n\n【39】        _Fat pad aspiration_\n\n【40】    *   d.\n\n【41】        _Distal nerve blockade with lidocaine/epinephrine_\n\n【42】    *   e.\n\n【43】        _Angiography_\n\n【44】Although amputation of the foot may be necessary at a later point in this patient's management given the finding of probable osteomyelitis, it is not the best choice at this time because further work-up and diagnostic evaluation to determine a cause are needed first. Sural nerve biopsy can be useful in detection of many systemic disorders that can lead to foot ischemia and peripheral neuropathy, including diabetes and rheumatoid vasculitis. However, given an unremarkable diabetes work-up and normal results on autoimmune studies, the yield of sural nerve biopsy would be low. Indeed, indications for sural nerve biopsy are dwindling.\n\n【45】Fat pad aspiration is an invasive diagnostic study for evaluation of amyloidosis. Amyloidosis, which typically presents with diffuse, multiorgan involvement, would not be likely in this patient with localized limb ischemia. Although pain control is an important part of management of foot ischemia, administration of lidocaine and epinephrine is inappropriate in this case. Infections create an acidic environment, which complicates dosing of local anesthetics given a predilection for ionization at lower pH. Epinephrine can also lead to further vascular compromise in a distal extremity, worsening the ischemia. Angiography is appropriate to further evaluate for vasculitic etiologies of arterial insufficiency.\n\n【46】Lower-extremity arteriography revealed diffuse medium-to-small vessel disease, worse on the left, consistent with vasculitis . Specifically, the angiogram depicts obliteration of the left anterior and posterior tibial arteries.\n\n【47】*   4.\n\n【48】    _Given the findings on arteriographic study, which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in evaluation and management?_\n\n【49】    *   a.\n\n【50】        _Place an inferior vena cava filter_\n\n【51】    *   b.\n\n【52】        _Perform aortofemoral bypass surgery_\n\n【53】    *   c.\n\n【54】        _Readdress smoking history_\n\n【55】    *   d.\n\n【56】        _Perform exercise electrocardiography_\n\n【57】    *   e.\n\n【58】        _Initiate clopidogrel_\n\n【59】FIGURE 2 Lower-extremity arteriogram showing diffuse medium-to-small vessel disease, worse on the left.\n\n【60】Inferior vena cava filter placement is performed in patients with lower-extremity venous thrombosis who demonstrate either failure of or contraindications to anticoagulation. It is not appropriate in the setting of arterial diseasewith no evidence of venous thrombus. Aortofemoral bypass surgery would be a reasonable choice for large-vessel arterial disease. However, the angiogram shows medium-to-small vessel disease; thus aortofemoral bypass is not indicated. Readdressing the smoking history, particularly given that the original history was obtained in the presence of the patient's mother, is the best choice given the findings consistent with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease). Additional discussion with the patient yielded a different history than previously obtained. Although cardiac evaluation should be pursued in patients with arterial disease, this patient would not be a candidate for exercise electrocardiography because of lower-extremity infection and pain. Clopidogrel, a platelet inhibitor that irreversibly blocks the adenosine diphosphate receptor on platelet cell membranes, is used for prevention of ischemia in patients with atherosclerotic disease. However, the angiogram shows evidence of vasculitis, not atherosclerotic disease, and thus clopidogrel therapy is not indicated.\n\n【61】When his mother was not present, the patient admitted that he had been smoking intermittently after his thrombectomy but denied other drug use. Given this additional history, Buerger disease was established as a working diagnosis.\n\n【62】*   5.\n\n【63】    _Which one of the following, if established, would greatly increase the likelihood of the presumed diagnosis?_\n\n【64】    *   a.\n\n【65】        _Lack of response to nitroprusside_\n\n【66】    *   b.\n\n【67】        _Consistent arteriographic findings in noninvolved limbs_\n\n【68】    *   c.\n\n【69】        _Subungual hemorrhage_\n\n【70】    *   d.\n\n【71】        _Family history of disease_\n\n【72】    *   e.\n\n【73】        _Elevated sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels_\n\n【74】Although endothelium-dependent relaxation is impaired in patients with Buerger disease, non-endothelium-dependent mechanisms appear to be intact\n\n【75】 thus, results of nitroprusside administration are not diagnostic for Buerger disease. Consistent arteriographic findings in clinically involved and noninvolved limbs are an essential feature of thromboangiitis obliterans.\n\n【76】Subungual hemorrhage would be consistent with endocarditis, not Buerger disease, and is less likely in this patient who has no systemic symptoms and negative results on blood cultures. Buerger disease does have an increased predominance among Ashkenazi Jews and represents a higher proportion of peripheral arterial disease in those of Korean, Japanese, and Indian descent\n\n【77】 however, family history is not an established risk factor. Unlike many other forms of vasculitis, acute phase reactants, such as sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels, are typically normal in Buerger disease; however, this phenomenon is not diagnostic.\n\n【78】The patient was also found to have small-vessel disease of the hand on arteriographic study despite normal radial and ulnar pulses, capillary refill, and extremity warmth, as well as negative results on Allen test. Given these findings and an otherwise negative work-up, Buerger disease was suspected.\n\n【79】When the subject of smoking cessation was addressed, the patient insisted that he would never smoke again. He was offered below-the-knee amputation, which he refused. Intermittent pneumatic pump therapy, the treatment of choice in patients unable to undergo revascularization, was initiated. The patient was dismissed on hospital day 7 with a Rooke boot, an intermittent pneumatic pump, a peripherally inserted central catheter for continued antibiotic therapy, low-molecular-weight heparin for at least 4 weeks, morphine for pain control, and close follow-up.\n\n【80】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【81】Buerger disease is an episodic, nonatherosclerotic, segmental vascular disease of small- and medium-sized arteries that typically affects multiple limbs and is triggered by tobacco exposure.\n\n【82】Buerger disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, and diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, hypercoagulable states, and embolic disease must first be ruled out.\n\n【83】In general, Buerger disease manifests in people younger than 45 years who currently use tobacco or have a history of recent tobacco use and distal-extremity ischemia.\n\n【84】Smoking history is an important feature in Buerger disease; however, the amount of tobacco use is not necessarily a marker of disease. Indeed, environmental tobacco smoke has been reported to lead to exacerbation, and even smokeless tobacco has been associated with the disease.\n\n【85】Furthermore, cannabis arteritis is thought by some to represent a form of the disease.\n\n【86】The relationship between tobacco and disease progression remains unclear. Given the strong tie between substance use and the etiology and progression of Buerger disease, a common misconception that smoking cessation is futile has emerged; in fact, no consensus has been reached in the literature on this point.\n\n【87】Regardless, smoking cessation is of clinical benefit and should be actively pursued in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans. An accurate tobacco history is valuable in patient assessment because smoking cessation remains the primary treatment of Buerger disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Whipple (1878-1976), George R. Minot (1885-1950), and William Parry Murphy for their work on finding a cure for pernicious anemia, previously an invariably fatal disease. Whipple conducted his research on dogs and concluded in 1920 that liver in the diet cured pernicious anemia and increased the reticulocyte count. With Whipple's work as background, Murphy and Minot studied patients with pernicious anemia and found in 1926 that a diet rich in liver could control the disease in humans. The Nobel Prize was given to the 3 scientists for their discoveries concerning liver therapy for anemias.\n\n【1】The son of a minister, Murphy was born on February 6, 1892, in Stoughton, Wis (about 15 miles south of Madison). He attended the local public schools and then enrolled at the University of Oregon in Eugene, from which he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1914. From 1914 to 1916, he taught high school physics and mathematics in Oregon and then enrolled at the University of Oregon Medical School in Portland. He spent the summer of 1917 studying at Rush Medical School in Chicago, Ill. From 1917 to 1918, he served in the US Army. In 1918, he received a fellowship that enabled him to attend Harvard University Medical School in Cambridge, Mass, from which he graduated in 1922 with an MD degree. He then served an internship at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence and later a residency at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, Mass. In 1923, he spent a brief time in private practice. During this time, he met Minot, a Boston physician who was associated with Harvard University and was investigating pernicious anemia.\n\n【2】In 1924, Murphy joined Harvard Medical School as an assistant instructor in medicine and worked with Minot. By 1926, Murphy and Minot had successfully completed their clinical trials of a liver diet in humans and presented their results to the medical community. However, it was not until 1928, when Harvard chemist Edwin Cohn (1892-1953) prepared a liver extract that was 50 to 100 times more potent than the natural food (liver), that the treatment became more acceptable to patients. The extract could be injected into muscle, which meant that patients no longer needed to eat large amounts of liver. This reduced the cost of treatment considerably.\n\n【3】However, the active ingredient in liver was unknown until 1948, when it was isolated by 2 chemists, Karl A. Folkers (1906-1997) of the United States and Alexander R. Todd (1907-1997) of Great Britain. The substance was a cobalamin called _vitamin B12_ . It could be injected directly into muscle, making it possible to treat pernicious anemia cheaply and effectively.\n\n【4】From 1924 to 1958, Murphy taught at Harvard University Medical School. He was also an associate in medicine at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital from 1928 until 1935 and then was senior associate in medicine and consultant in hematology from 1935 to 1958. In 1958, he retired and became professor emeritus. In 1939, he published _Anemia in Practice_ .\n\n【5】Besides receiving the Nobel Prize, Murphy was awarded the Cameron Prize and Lectureship of the University of Edinburgh (Scotland) in 1930, the Bronze Medal of the American Medical Association in 1934, and the Gold Medal of the Massachusetts Humane Society in 1937. He also was a member of many prestigious scientific and medical societies.\n\n【6】On October 9, 1987, at the age of 95 years, William Parry Murphy died in Brookline, Mass (a suburb of Boston). He was honored as a Nobel laureate on a stamp (Scott No. 2116g) issued by the Maldive Islands in 1995.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

This update was based on a systematic review of the evidence and replaces the previous guidelines from 2002 that were widely accepted and implemented in clinical practice. The new cholesterol treatment guideline emphasizes matching the intensity of statin treatment to the level of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and replaces the old paradigm of pursuing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. The new guideline also emphasizes the primacy of the evidence base for statin therapy for ASCVD risk reduction and lists several patient groups that will not benefit from statin treatment despite their high cardiovascular risk, such as those with heart failure (New York Heart Association class II-IV) and patients undergoing hemodialysis. The guideline has been received with mixed reviews and significant controversy. Because of the evidence-based nature of the guideline, there is room for several questions and uncertainties on when and how to use lipid-lowering therapy in clinical practice. The goal of the Mayo Clinic Task Force in the assessment, interpretation, and expansion of the ACC/AHA cholesterol treatment guideline is to address gaps in information and some of the controversial aspects of the newly released cholesterol management guideline using additional sources of evidence and expert opinion as needed to guide clinicians on key aspects of ASCVD risk reduction.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】A to Z ( Aggrastat to Zocor ), ABI ( ankle-brachial index ), ACC/AHA ( American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association ), ACCORD ( Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ), AFCAPS-TexCAPS ( Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study ), ALT ( alanine aminotransferase ), ASCOT-LLA ( Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial—Lipid-Lowering Arm ), ASCVD ( atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ), ASPEN ( Atorvastatin Study for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease Endpoints in Non–Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ), ATP III ( Adult Treatment Panel III ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), CARDS ( Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study ), CARE ( Cardiac Angiography in Renally Impaired Patients ), CHD ( coronary heart disease ), CK ( creatine kinase ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), CORONA ( Controlled Rosuvastatin in Multinational Trial in Heart Failure ), CT ( computed tomography ), CTTC ( Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaborators ), CV ( cardiovascular ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), DM ( diabetes mellitus ), eGFR ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ), GISSI-HF ( Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico Heart Failure ), GTBC ( Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol ), HDL-C ( high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), HF ( heart failure ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), HPS ( Heart Protection Study ), hsCRP ( high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ), IDEAL ( Incremental Decrease in Clinical Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering ), JUPITER ( Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin ), LDL-C ( low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), NYHA ( New York Heart Association ), PROSPER ( Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk ), PROVE-IT ( Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy ), Rx ( treatment ), SEARCH ( Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine ), TLC ( therapeutic lifestyle change ), TNT ( Treating to New Targets ), 4S ( Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study )\n\n【4】The updated American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol (GTBC) has been long-awaited since the latest update of the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines in 2004.\n\n【5】Implications of recent clinical trials for the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines.\n\n【6】The updated GTBC recommends a significant paradigm shift in lipid-lowering drug therapy for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction, which has led to questions regarding their content and their implementation.\n\n【7】2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.\n\n【8】The updated GTBC was developed by an expert panel of individuals guided by methods consistent with recommendations from the Institute of Medicine for the development of clinical practice guidelines.

No RCTs were identified that compared outcomes based on different LDL-C or non–HDL-C treatment goals. |\n| What is the evidence for LDL-C and non–HDL-C goals for the primary prevention of ASCVD? | 4 of 6 RCTs of primary prevention of ASCVD with statin therapy were examined. In 2 studies, treatment targets were included but were not used as a firm strategy in the intervention arms of the studies (AFCAPS-TEXCAPS: lovastatin, 20-24 mg, to achieve LDL-C levels <110 mg/dL, 40% of the treatment group followed this course; MEGA trial: pravastatin, 10-20 mg, to achieve total cholesterol levels <220 mg/dL). No RCTs were identified that compared treatment strategies based on differing LDL-C or non–HDL-C targets. |\n| For primary and secondary prevention, what is the effect on the lipid levels, effectiveness, and safety of specific cholesterol-modifying drugs used for lipid management in general and in selected subgroups? | RCTs involving available lipid-lowering drugs were included for consideration. Plant stanols and sterols were not included because no ASCVD outcome studies were identified. Red yeast rice was not evaluated because it was not available for use during most of the period under consideration. |\n\n【15】AFCAPS-TexCAPS = Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study; ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; MEGA = Management of Elevated Cholesterol in the Primary Prevention Group of Adult Japanese; RCT = randomized controlled trial; 4S = Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study.\n\n【16】Table 2 Summary of the ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce ASCVD\n\n【17】ACC/AHA = American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association; ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; DM = diabetes mellitus; LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\n\n| 1\\. Persons ≥21 y who fall into any of the following 4 at-risk groups are to be considered for statin therapy to reduce ASCVD risk: |\n| --- |\n| a. Known ASCVD |\n| b. LDL-C level >190 mg/dL |\n| c. Diabetes, aged 40-75 y, with LDL-C levels of 70-189 mg/dL |\n| d. 10-y risk of cardiac event or stroke ≥7.5% (by the Pooled Cohort Risk Calculator) |\n| 2\\. Lipid-lowering statin therapy should be based on the degree of ASCVD risk and the intensity of the statin. High-intensity statin therapybHigh-intensity therapy (≥50% LDL-C reduction): atorvastatin, 40-80 mg; rosuvastatin, 20-40 mg.is recommended for patients with known ASCVD, LDL-C levels >190 mg/dL, and DM, with 10-y risk >7.5%. Moderate-dose statin therapycModerate-intensity therapy (30%-49% LDL-C reduction): atorvastatin, 10-20 mg; rosuvastatin, 5-10 mg; simvastatin, 20-40 mgd; pravastatin, 40-80 mg; lovastatin, 40 mg; fluvastatin XL, 80 mg; fluvastatin, 40 mg twice daily; pitavastatin, 2-4 mg.is recommended for the other treatment groups (patients with DM but with 10-y risk <7.5% and those without DM who have a 10-y risk >7.5%). |\n| 3\\. The expert panel did not recommend for or against LDL-C goals or targets but rather recommends that lipids be checked at baseline and then 4-12 wk after initiating statin therapy to assess adherence and response to therapy. Individuals receiving high-dose statin therapy would be expected to lower their LDL-C level by >50% from their baseline level, and those receiving moderate-dose statin therapy would be expected to lower their LDL-C level by 30%-49%. |\n| 4\\.

These classes include patients with established ASCVD, patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels greater than 190 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) (likely familial hypercholesterolemia), diabetic patients aged 40 to 75 years with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg/dL, and those aged 40 to 75 years without diabetes mellitus (DM) or ASCVD but with an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of at least 7.5%. Furthermore, the panel found no evidence for treating to a particular goal LDL-C or non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level but accepts the practice of up-titrating doses when there is a less-than-anticipated response to statin therapy. Broad adoption of this guideline should aid in the appropriate tailoring of the intensity of statin therapy relative to baseline risk and should help limit the use of unnecessary and unproven add-on therapies. The panel also found no evidence to support initiation of lipid-lowering treatment in patients with heart failure (HF) with a New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II to IV or in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing hemodialysis. The panel also introduced the idea of sharing the decision-making process with the patient and incorporating patient preferences and values.\n\n【22】Pitfalls With Randomized Clinical Trials as the Only Source of Evidence\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Clinical trials generally define a somewhat narrow study population and have entry criteria that exclude many patients who might be seen in a typical clinic and who would be most likely to benefit from the drug under study. Industry-sponsored trials do not generally address questions of broad interest, and neither do they usually include medications that are off patent. For example, the Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial assessed the benefit of using moderate- to high-intensity rosuvastatin, a relatively new, nongeneric statin, in patients with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels.\n\n【24】Rosuvastatin to prevent vascular events in men and women with elevated C-reactive protein.\n\n【25】Patients with normal LDL-C levels, multiple nonlipid risk factors, but normal hsCRP levels were not included in the trial. In the end, the trial assessed the impact of a patented test to screen patients and a patented statin to treat them.\n\n【26】Although published randomized clinical trials generally represent “scientific truth”, it is important to recognize that in reality truth is not simply the sum of published randomized clinical trials. Randomized clinical trials exclude many patients who need and might benefit from therapy; exclusion criteria and run-in periods often ensure that a study drug will have the greatest potential for impact, whereas it leaves many unanswered questions regarding the potential benefit or even harm for the excluded groups. In general, randomized clinical trials could end up representing a fraction of individuals affected by the condition being studied. Furthermore, there is a significant bias, either intentional or unintentional, toward publishing and publicizing a positive study, whereas negative trials might not get published  or publicized.\n\n【27】The time horizon is also an issue. Clinical trials rarely assess outcomes in a timeframe beyond 4 or 5 years. Some analyses extend outcome assessment several years longer but rarely provide effectiveness data beyond 10 years. This shortcoming, along with the fact that the 10-year horizon is typically used in ASCVD risk assessment, leads to the erroneous conclusion that only outcomes that occur or may be prevented within a 10-year timeframe matter.\n\n【28】It may also be worth commenting, in the spirit of basing recommendations on evidence, that no randomized clinical trial has used the Framingham or another risk factor score to select patients for statin therapy. It is equally true that none of the randomized clinical trials of statin vs placebo targeted a specific percentage of LDL-C level lowering, and neither did any of the statin comparison trials intentionally compare 2 prespecified degrees of LDL-C level lowering.\n\n【29】Filling the Gaps\n----------------\n\n【30】The new guideline represents a major step forward by the ACC/AHA to produce evidence-based clinical recommendations. However, the same approach that enhances the scientific validity of the recommendations and the panel decision to focus on cholesterol treatment also allows for many unanswered questions, leaving clinicians with multiple uncertainties about when and how to use lipid-lowering therapy in clinical practice. The following sections review some of the controversies of the new guideline using additional sources of evidence and address gaps in information primarily based on expert opinion to guide clinicians on key aspects of cardiovascular risk reduction. Table 3 compares the ACC/AHA GTBC and the Mayo Clinic Task Force recommendations, and the Figure summarizes the recommendations with an algorithm.\n\n【31】Table 3 Comparison Between the ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol and the Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n| Variable | ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol | Mayo Clinic position |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Pretreatment evaluation | Obtaining a fasting lipid panel, ALT, and hemoglobin A 1c if diabetes status is unknown, and CK level if indicated. Consider evaluation of secondary causes of hyperlipidemia or conditions that may influence statin safety. | Same.Measuring fasting blood glucose levels would also be reasonable if diabetes status is unknown. Consider measuring CK levels at baseline in African American patients. |\n| Focus on statin treatment | Statins should be the cornerstone of lipid treatment for the reduction of ASCVD risk, but other medications might be considered in special circumstances, such as statin intolerance or when patients do not achieve the anticipated cholesterol reduction. | Statins should be the cornerstone of lipid treatment for the reduction of ASCVD risk. Nonstatin drugs, such as niacin, ezetimibe, and bile acid binding resins, may also be considered in statin-intolerant patients, patients who do not get the anticipated response to statin monotherapy, or patients with an LDL-C level at baseline >190 mg/dL. We recommend considering fibrate with statin therapy in patients with high triglyceride and low HDL-C levels. |\n| Statin therapy matching intensity to ASCVD risk, not based on lipid thresholds or targets | The decision to initiate statin therapy and its intensity are based on underlying ASCVD risk and not on lipid thresholds or targets. | We agree that the decision to initiate statin therapy and its intensity should be based on underlying ASCVD risk and not on lipid thresholds or targets, despite the fact that such a strategy has not been studied widely in randomized clinical trials. Statin RCTs have targeted patient populations with a particular ASCVD risk factor(s) and not according to a specific risk threshold.In patients who are currently taking low-dose statins, would not recommend increasing the dose if the LDL-C level has already decreased by 30%-50% from baseline. In patients who are currently taking low-dose statins but with unknown baseline LDL-C levels, would not recommend increasing the dose if the LDL-C level is <70 mg in the presence of ASCVD or <100 mg without ASCVD. |\n| Role of therapeutic lifestyle changes | Physicians should emphasize healthy lifestyle habits and address other risk factors when initiating statin therapy for the primary prevention of ASCVD. | When considering the initiation of statin treatment for the primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated risk, it is reasonable to attempt therapeutic lifestyle changes in highly motivated individuals for whom ASCVD risk could reasonably be decreased to below the statin treatment threshold (<7.5% 10-y risk of an ASCVD event). ASCVD risk should be reevaluated in 3-6 mo. If 10-y estimated risk is still >7.5%, the provider and patient should discuss the possible addition of statin therapy. |\n| Lipid management in the elderly | Initiate moderate-intensity statin therapy in persons aged >75 y in the presence of clinical ASCVD. Recommend the continuation of statin therapy beyond age 75 y in persons who are already taking and tolerating statins. Recommend consideration of additional factors before initiating statin therapy for the primary prevention of ASCVD in individuals aged >75 y, including potential benefit, risk of adverse effects, increasing comorbidities, drug-drug interaction, and patient preferences. | Same general recommendations. Also, clinicians should highlight the scarcity of evidence to support statin treatment for the primary prevention of ASCVD in individuals aged >75 y or who have comorbidities that may limit life expectancy. We recommend having a low threshold to discontinue statin treatment in these patients if there are any safety concerns. |\n| Lipid management in people with diabetes mellitus | Initiate moderate-intensity statin treatment for patients with diabetes aged 40-75 y and consider high-intensity statin treatment when the 10-y ASCVD risk is ≥7.5%. In persons with diabetes mellitus aged <40 y, statin therapy should be individualized based on considerations of ASCVD risk reduction benefits, potential adverse effects, and patient preferences. | We recommend that for the primary prevention of ASCVD, patients with diabetes aged 21-75 y identified as being at high risk for ASCVD (10-y risk ≥7.5% or 30-y risk ≥30%) should receive at least moderate-intensity statin treatment and could consider intensive therapy if tolerated, particularly if LDL-C levels are >70 mg/dL or non–HDL-C levels are >100 mg/dL. We recommend that patients with diabetes with an intermediate risk of ASCVD (5%-7.5% risk at 10 y, or 20%-30% at 30 y if aged 21-50 y) should be offered moderate-intensity statin treatment using shared decision-making methods with his or her provider, recognizing the lack of evidence in diabetes with this level of ASCVD risk. There is no evidence to recommend statin treatment in patients with diabetes and low ASCVD risk (<5% at 10 y and <20% at 30 y). |\n| Lipid management in patients without clinical ASCVD, aged <40 y, and with an LDL-C level of 70-189 mg/dL | Statin therapy may be considered in selected persons. Other factors that might influence the decision will be an LDL-C level ≥160 mg/dL, a family history of early-onset CAD, coronary calcification, an elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, an abnormal ankle-brachial index, or a high lifetime ASCVD risk. No details of these recommendations are provided. | An initial lifestyle approach is particularly advisable in this age group because there are no safety data with very-long-term statin therapy.We recommend moderate-intensity statin treatment for individuals aged 21-39 y with moderate hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C level of 160-189 mg/dL) or with a 30-y ASCVD risk >30% or a family history of premature ASCVD if the LDL-C level is >100 mg/dL. There is no role for coronary calcium computed tomography or ankle-brachial index in this age group because sensitivity is low in this age group. |\n| Lipid management in those without clinical ASCVD aged ≥40 y who are free of diabetes and have an LDL-C level of 70-189 mg/dL | To estimate the 10-y ASCVD risk and determine whether risk is ≥7.5%, to initiate moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy, and whether risk is 5% to <7.5% to consider moderate-intensity statin therapy. In the process, to engage in a clinician-patient discussion of the potential for ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences. | Estimate the 10-y ASCVD risk. Then use shared decision making with or without tools or decision aids to display and discuss risks, benefits, and costs.If risk is ≥7.5%, recommend therapeutic lifestyle changes if the patient is motivated and the ASCVD risk could be reasonably reduced with lifestyle changes to <7.5%.Consider moderate-intensity statin therapy in patients with an ASCVD risk ≥7.5%, particularly if the LDL-C level is >100 mg/dL or the non–HDL-C level is >130 mg/dL, if risk cannot be reasonably reduced with therapeutic lifestyle change. We recommend that in patients at high risk for ASCVD but with LDL-C levels <100 mg/dL to focus on improvement of nonlipid risk factors for the primary prevention of ASCVD. |\n| Persons aged ≤75 y with clinical ASCVD | If no safety concerns, recommend high-intensity statin therapy regardless of the baseline LDL-C level. | For persons without safety concerns, recommend high-intensity statin therapy if the LDL-C level is ≥70 mg/dL. We do not recommend for or against high-intensity statin treatment for persons with LDL-C levels <70 mg/dL not already taking a lipid-lowering medication. The decision to start moderate-intensity statin treatment when the LDL-C level is <70 mg/dL can be considered and discussed with the patient, recognizing the lack of evidence for such therapy in this population. |\n| Role of shared decision making with the patient | Engage in clinician-patient discussions of potential ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences when considering the initiation of statin treatment for primary prevention. | We recommend exercising shared decision making between the patient and the clinician. Strongly consider using tools or decision aids to help improve patient understanding of individualized risks, benefits, and costs of treatment. This applies not only to situations in which a specific cutoff value of risk is proposed to determine the initiation of statin therapy but also when deciding to use high-intensity statin therapy in patients with established ASCVD or diabetes mellitus. |\n| Role of statin treatment in people with evidence of subclinical ASCVD | Statins may be considered in individuals with an abnormal ankle-brachial index or with a coronary artery calcification Agatston score ≥300 or ≥75th percentile for age and sex. | We recommend the initiation of statin treatment in patients with subclinical ASCVD, especially if the disease is extensive (eg, a coronary calcium score ≥75th percentile for age and sex), absolute score is ≥300, or a computed tomographic angiogram shows evidence of obstructive disease (>60% stenosis), even in the absence of ischemia or cardiovascular symptoms, or if multiple small plaques (<30% stenosis) are present. Patients with other manifestations of subclinical atherosclerosis, such as carotid plaque or asymptomatic peripheral vascular disease, may also benefit from statin therapy. |\n| Lipid-lowering treatment in statin-intolerant patients | If muscle or other symptoms occur, establish their relationship to statin therapy. If symptoms develop during statin therapy, discontinue the therapy. If mild to moderate symptoms resolve, rechallenge the patient with the same or a lower dose of statin. If muscle symptoms recur, discontinue statin therapy and rechallenge with progressively lower doses of the same or a different statin. Consider nonstatin cholesterol-lowering therapy in high-risk individuals (with ASCVD, diabetes, or LDL-C levels ≥190 mg/dL), preferentially drugs that have been found in RCTs to provide ASCVD risk reduction. No details provided. | If muscle or other symptoms occur, establish their relationship to statin therapy. If symptoms develop during statin therapy, discontinue the therapy. If mild to moderate symptoms resolve, rechallenge with a different statin. If muscle symptoms recur, consider rechallenge with a third statin or use either 5 mg of rosuvastatin or 10 mg of atorvastatin every other day, twice a week, or once a week, recognizing that limited evidence exists to prove a reduction in ASCVD events using this approach. Consider the use of ezetimibe, niacin, or bile acid sequestrants in individuals with elevated LDL-C and fibrate levels if the non–HDL-C level is elevated and at high risk for ASCVD events. Consider these options as monotherapy for totally statin-intolerant patients, but preferably in addition to a low dose of statin. |\n| Lipid-lowering treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease | Initiation of statin therapy is not routinely recommended for persons who are receiving maintenance hemodialysis. No specific recommendations are given for patients with chronic kidney disease not undergoing hemodialysis. | Continue statin treatment in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis if a statin has been well tolerated and there is no evidence of CK elevation. Do not initiate statin treatment in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.In patients with chronic kidney disease not undergoing hemodialysis, consider moderate-intensity statin or low-dose statin plus ezetimibe therapy. |\n| Lipid-lowering treatment in patients with NYHA class II-IV HF | Statin initiation is not routinely recommended for patients with NYHA class II-IV HF. Continue statin therapy for patients with HF who are taking statins that have been well tolerated. | Statin therapy initiation is not routinely recommended for patients with NYHA class II-IV HF. Continue statin therapy for patients with HF who are taking statins and are free of adverse effects.We recommend considering initiation of statin therapy in patients with HF who meet all 4 of the following criteria: (1) HF is well-controlled and with a projection of good survival (life expectancy >2 y); (2) ASCVD is the underlying cause of HF; (3) the baseline LDL-C level is ≥130 mg/dL; and (4) age is <75 y. |\n| Patients with chronic rheumatologic/inflammatory diseases or HIV+ patients receiving antiretroviral therapy | Clinician judgment is especially important for these patient groups for whom RCT evidence is insufficient for guiding clinical recommendations. | It seems prudent to initiate statin therapy for primary ASCVD prevention in patients whose estimated 10-y risk for ASCVD is >5% or 30-y risk is >20%, particularly if their LDL-C level is >130 mg/dL. Consider subclinical disease assessment in patients whose risk is <5%. |\n| Patients with solid organ transplant | Clinician judgment is especially important for these patient groups for whom the RCT evidence is insufficient for guiding clinical recommendations. | We recommend starting all cardiac and renal transplant recipients on low- to moderate-intensity statin therapy (other than simvastatin) after careful consideration of drug-drug interactions. |\n| Role of niacin or fibrates | None specifically listed. | There is a potential role for niacin or fibrates in patients with high triglyceride and low HDL-C levels, particularly diabetic patients. There is a potential role for fibrates in patients with ASCVD, particularly CAD, and an HDL-C level <40 mg/dL, particularly if patients are unable to take statins. These agents may be considered in patients intolerant to statins or in those whose LDL-C level does not decrease as expected according to the intensity of lipid-lowering drug therapy. |\n| Follow-up laboratory tests | Assess adherence response to therapy and adverse effects at 4-12 wk of statin initiation, remeasuring the fasting lipid panel. Do not routinely monitor hepatic function with ALT levels or muscle injury with CK levels unless the patient is symptomatic. Screen and treat type 2 diabetes mellitus according to current practice guidelines. Unclear whether lipids need to be tested in the long-term. | Same.It is reasonable also to recheck lipid parameters every 1-3 y, to monitor statin adherence, and to reassess ASCVD risk.Although reduction in the LDL-C level is the basis of ASCVD risk reduction, review of other lipid parameters, particularly triglycerides, may provide important insights into compliance with lifestyle recommendations. |\n\n【33】ACC/AHA = American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association; ALT = alanine aminotransferase; ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CAD = coronary artery disease; CK = creatine kinase; HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HF = heart failure; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; NYHA = New York Heart Association; RCT = randomized controlled trial.\n\n【34】Figure Proposed algorithm when considering initiating statins for cholesterol treatment in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk reduction.

Some patients, however, could potentially lower their cardiovascular risk to less than the statin treatment threshold with therapeutic lifestyle change alone and may not technically qualify for statin treatment. For example, a 55-year-old man who smokes and has mildly elevated blood pressure (135/80 mm Hg), an elevated non–HDL-C level (175 mg/dL 删除20:<u>\\[to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259\\]</u>), a suboptimal diet, a sedentary lifestyle, and an estimated 10-year risk of 13.8% might be able to reduce his cardiovascular risk to 5% if he can quit smoking and improve his blood pressure and HDL-C level by means of exercise training and healthy dietary habits. Clinicians need to assess the likelihood that such a significant lifestyle change will occur and also need to calculate the ASCVD risk assuming realistic goals to determine whether the risk can be decreased low enough so that the patient would not qualify for statin treatment in the near future. This point illustrates that a major risk of emphasizing the primary value of statin treatment is that patients might overlook the importance of lifestyle changes in cardiovascular risk reduction.\n\n【39】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【40】When considering the initiation of statin treatment for the primary prevention of ASCVD in patients with elevated risk, it is reasonable to attempt therapeutic lifestyle changes in highly motivated individuals for whom ASCVD risk could reasonably be decreased to below the statin treatment threshold (<7.5% 10-year risk of an ASCVD event). Risk of ASCVD should be reevaluated in 3 to 6 months. If 10-year estimated risk is still greater than 7.5%, the provider and patient should discuss the possible addition of statin therapy.\n\n【41】### Use of Non–HDL-C Level as a Criterion for Initiation of Treatment\n\n【42】The new guideline does not recommend treatment to reach a particular LDL-C or non–HDL-C level, which is understandable because the panel did not find any evidence of treating to a target. However, they still use LDL-C levels to assess baseline risk and do not make any recommendations about using non–HDL-C levels as point-of-care criteria, despite a wealth of epidemiologic studies showing non–HDL-C level to be a superior marker of cardiovascular risk than LDL-C level.\n\n【43】Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level as a predictor of cardiovascular disease mortality.\n\n【44】Non-HDL cholesterol as a predictor of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes: the strong heart study.\n\n【45】Indeed, the Pooled Cohort Risk Calculator inputs total cholesterol and HDL-C (hence, non–HDL-C) levels, not LDL-C levels, into the equation to calculate risk. This is especially true in patients with DM, as evidenced by a post hoc meta-analysis of 4 large longitudinal studies that found increased coronary heart disease (CHD) risk with increasing non–HDL-C levels but not LDL-C levels.\n\n【46】Furthermore, changes in non–HDL-C levels have been found to better explain the treatment effect of statins than changes in LDL-C levels.\n\n【47】Association of LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B levels with risk of cardiovascular events among patients treated with statins: a meta-analysis.\n\n【48】Relation between baseline and on-treatment lipid parameters and first acute major coronary events in the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS).\n\n【49】The ATP III had recommended non–HDL-C as a secondary target in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, and many other organizations, such as the National Lipid Association, the American Diabetes Association, and the ACC,\n\n【50】Lipoprotein management in patients with cardiometabolic risk: consensus conference report from the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology Foundation.\n\n【51】also strongly support the use of non–HDL-C level to assess cardiovascular risk. Many patients with metabolic syndrome or DM and dyslipidemia have elevated non–HDL-C levels despite normal to low LDL-C levels. Offering therapy to patients with elevated non–HDL-C levels is clearly more judicious and is a must for patients with DM and hypertriglyceridemia. Although the ATP III had made such recommendations, its importance was not appreciated, and anecdotal evidence suggests that few practitioners focused their attention on this “secondary” target.\n\n【52】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【53】To avoid confusion, it would be reasonable to recommend using non–HDL-C level as the sole lipid parameter to assess baseline risk in all patients. It can be easily measured in a nonfasting sample using current robust analytical methods without any additional costs. Because it is an integrated measure of all atherogenic lipoproteins, including LDL-C, changing from LDL-C to non–HDL-C thresholds will not miss any high-risk patients, such as those with familial hypercholesterolemia, but will better identify other high-risk patients, such as those with diabetic dyslipidemia. Restricting statin therapy for primary prevention to patients with non–HDL-C levels greater than 130 mg/dL would be a prudent option.\n\n【54】### Lipid Management for ASCVD Risk Reduction in People With DM\n\n【55】The recommendation to initiate moderate- or moderate- to high-dose statin therapy in all patients with DM aged 40 to 75 years with LDL-C levels greater than 70 mg/dL regardless of their level of risk is not entirely supported by published randomized clinical trial evidence. First, contemporary cohort studies and 1 meta-analysis have debunked the assumption that DM is an ASCVD risk equivalent.\n\n【56】For individuals with type 2 DM without a history of myocardial infarction (MI), their ASCVD risk is approximately 30% of the ASCVD for nondiabetic patients with a history of MI and only approximately 50% in patients with a history of DM, whether the diagnosis of DM was incidental or prevalent.\n\n【57】Second, there are no large randomized clinical trials in the primary prevention of ASCVD involving people with DM that have compared high- versus low-intensity statin therapy or that have used high-dose statin therapy alone . Third, the benefits of statin therapy in the primary prevention of ASCVD events in individuals with type 2 DM, as shown by the results of the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial—Lipid-Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA), and the Heart Protection Study (HPS),\n\n【58】Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with atorvastatin in type 2 diabetes in the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS): multicentre randomised placebo-controlled trial.\n\n【59】Reduction in cardiovascular events with atorvastatin in 2,532 patients with type 2 diabetes: Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial—lipid-lowering arm (ASCOT-LLA).\n\n【60】may be applicable only to patients with an ASCVD risk similar to that in participants enrolled in these trials. The CARDS enrolled patients with DM with an LDL-C level less than 160 mg/dL and the presence of at least 1 other cardiovascular risk factor, such as smoking or hypertension, or other risk indicators, such as retinopathy or albuminuria. All the patients in the ASCOT-ALL were hypertensive and had to have several major risk factors for ASCVD to be enrolled in the trial. In the HPS, 51% of participants had cardiovascular disease (CVD). The 10-year ASCVD risk, estimated by the event rate in the placebo group, was well above 20% in all studies assessing the effect of statin therapy in patients with DM. This level of risk is significantly higher than what has been reported in population-based cohort studies, with reported 10-year risk for fatal or nonfatal CHD of approximately 11%.\n\n【61】Fourth, the subgroup analyses grouped by LDL-C level that were performed in these trials used LDL-C cutoff values from 115 to 135 mg/dL. No results were reported on the subgroups with LDL-C levels less than100 mg/dL. Indirect estimates using baseline mean values and standard deviations suggest that there were few individuals with LDL-C levels less than 90 mg/dL in these trials. Fifth, several studies, such as the Atorvastatin Study for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease Endpoints in Non–Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (ASPEN) and ASCOT, did not find a significant benefit for primary prevention of MI or ischemic heart disease mortality in people with DM. Supplemental Table 1  shows the inclusion criteria, intervention tested, mean LDL-C level at baseline, percentage of patients who developed the primary outcome in the placebo group, and other information of the main randomized clinical trials testing the effect of statin therapy in people with DM. The table illustrates that the evidence justifying statin therapy in patients with DM may not apply to all patients with DM in the general population. Patients with DM in the general population, who have no other comorbidities, particularly if they are men or women younger than 50 years, may be found to have a relatively low 10-year ASCVD risk, as measured by the Pooled Cohort Risk Calculator. The cholesterol management guideline, in this case, is somewhat inconsistent in that it recommends the use of a statin treatment threshold of 7.5% or greater for individuals without DM while it recommends statin therapy in patients with type 2 DM aged 40 to 75 years even if their calculated risk is less than 7.5%.\n\n【62】Another issue to consider in the treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia is that many patients with DM have hypertriglyceridemia and are likely to benefit from combination therapy with statin and fibrate. The ACC/AHA panel acknowledges the evidence of benefit of such treatment from a subgroup analysis of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial but stops short of recommending combination therapy. Because multiple fibrate trials besides ACCORD have consistently reported better outcomes in the subgroup of patients with high triglyceride and low HDL-C levels,\n\n【63】Effects of combination lipid therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\n【64】Joint effects of serum triglyceride and LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol concentrations on coronary heart disease risk in the Helsinki Heart Study: implications for treatment.\n\n【65】Relation of gemfibrozil treatment and lipid levels with major coronary events: VA-HIT: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【66】Effects of fenofibrate treatment on cardiovascular disease risk in 9,795 individuals with type 2 diabetes and various components of the metabolic syndrome: the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study.\n\n【67】it is important to consider statin-fibrate combination therapy in this select group of patients, keeping in mind that combining fibrates with statins can increase the risk of adverse effects and that no trial using fibrates has found a reduction in mortality.\n\n【68】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【69】For the primary prevention of ASCVD, patients with DM aged 21 to 75 years identified as being at high risk for ASCVD (10-year risk ≥7.5% or 30-year risk ≥30%) should receive statin treatment and could consider intensive therapy if tolerated, particularly if the LDL-C level is greater than 70 mg/dL or the non–HDL-C level is greater than 100 mg/dL. We recommend that patients with DM with an intermediate risk of ASCVD (5%-7.5% risk at 10 years or 20%-30% at 30 years if aged 21-50 years) should be offered statin treatment, using shared decision-making methods with his or her provider, recognizing the lack of evidence in DM with this level of ASCVD risk. There is no evidence to recommend statin treatment in patients with DM and low ASCVD risk (<5% at 10 years and <20% at 30 years).\n\n【70】### Lipid Management for Primary Prevention in Individuals Aged 40 to 75 Years Identified as Being at High Risk but With a Low LDL-C Level (<100 mg/dL)\n\n【71】One of the most controversial aspects of the GTBC pertains to primary prevention in patients without ASCVD, DM, or severe hypercholesterolemia. Statin therapy is recommended in those aged 40 to 75 years with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg/dL and an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5% or greater. Because the calculated risk of almost all patients older than 65 years would be greater than 7.5% irrespective of their lipid levels, adherence to this guideline would likely lead to initiation of statin therapy in many patients.\n\n【72】Application of new cholesterol guidelines to a population-based sample.\n\n【73】It is especially difficult to justify statin therapy for primary prevention in patients with baseline LDL-C levels in the 70- to 100-mg/dL range when their sole determinant of risk is their age.

The mean baseline LDL-C levels in those 3 trials ranged from 150 to 192 mg/dL. In the remaining 2 trials, the ASCOT-ALL required participants to have hypertension and at least 3 additional risk factors,\n\n【80】Prevention of coronary and stroke events with atorvastatin in hypertensive patients who have average or lower-than-average cholesterol concentrations, in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial—Lipid Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA): a multicentre randomised controlled trial.\n\n【81】and the JUPITER trial required an elevated C-reactive protein level.\n\n【82】Rosuvastatin to prevent vascular events in men and women with elevated C-reactive protein.\n\n【83】Evidence is limited on the potential impact of statin therapy for ASCVD primary prevention in patients with LDL-C levels less than 100 mg/dL.  The panelists acknowledged this limitation but pointed to the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaborators (CTTC) meta-analysis data\n\n【84】The effects of lowering LDL cholesterol with statin therapy in people at low risk of vascular disease: meta-analysis of individual data from 27 randomised trials.\n\n【85】showing similar benefits of LDL-C reduction with statin therapy in patients with lower baseline LDL-C levels (≤70 mg/dL). However, the results were not reported based on treatment strategy but as risk reduction per millmole reduction in LDL-C level. In addition, this analysis included data from multiple clinical trials of patients with stable CHD or acute coronary syndrome and not only patients studied for primary prevention. In fact, in the latter group, the relative risk reduction in the subgroup of patients with baseline LDL-C levels less than 77 mg/dL was not significant (relative risk = 0.87; 95% confidence interval = 0.6-1.28). A subgroup analysis of the JUPITER trial did not find a statistically significant benefit with high-dose statin treatment in patients with baseline LDL-C levels less than 90 mg/dL.\n\n【86】Similarly, in the MEGA trial (Management of Elevated Cholesterol in the Primary Prevention Group of Adult Japanese) testing statins for the primary prevention of ASCVD, there was no event reduction in patients with baseline LDL-C levels less than 155 mg/dL.\n\n【87】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【88】Consider statin therapy for primary ASCVD prevention only in patients with baseline LDL-C levels of 100 mg/dL or greater or non–HDL-C levels of 130 mg/dL or greater, unless they have evidence of subclinical ASCVD or have elevated hsCRP levels, until more data in patients with LDL-C levels less than 100 mg/dL are available. The Mayo Clinic Task Force also recommends that for the primary prevention of ASCVD in individuals with a high estimated ASCVD risk but an LDL-C level less than 100 mg/dL, one should focus on nonlipid risk factors for ASCVD.\n\n【89】### Very Low LDL-C Levels in Patients With ASCVD\n\n【90】The ACC/AHA GTBC recommends high-intensity statin therapy in patients with clinical ASCVD regardless of their LDL-C levels. The assumption is that statins will reduce outcomes irrespective of baseline LDL-C levels. Although 3 of the 5 randomized clinical trials that compared high-intensity and low- to standard-intensity statin treatment in patients with CHD did not have a lower LDL-C cutoff limit to enter the trial, the studies likely ended up with few patients with very low LDL-C levels (<70 mg/dL).\n\n【91】Intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol with 80 mg versus 20 mg simvastatin daily in 12,064 survivors of myocardial infarction: a double-blind randomised trial.\n\n【92】Intensive versus moderate lipid lowering with statins after acute coronary syndromes.\n\n【93】Early intensive vs a delayed conservative simvastatin strategy in patients with acute coronary syndromes: phase Z of the A to Z trial.\n\n【94】Intensive lipid lowering with atorvastatin in patients with stable coronary disease.\n\n【95】High-dose atorvastatin vs usual-dose simvastatin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction: the IDEAL study: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【96】Supplemental Table 3  shows the highlights of the randomized clinical trials comparing high and low doses of statins in people with ASCVD. Mean LDL-C levels at baseline ranged from 97 to 121 mg/dL, although 2 trials reported baseline LDL-C values tested after the run-in period for statin therapy. In addition, the evidence supporting the use of high-intensity vs low- to standard-intensity treatment is probably not as robust as has been promulgated, so it is difficult to extrapolate any presumed benefit to individuals with very low LDL-C levels. To illustrate this point, only 2 of the 3 clinical trials using high-intensity statin treatment reached statistical significance for the primary (composite) outcome and none for total mortality. There was significant heterogeneity in the effect of high-intensity statin treatment regarding individual outcome end points. For example, the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE-IT) trial\n\n【97】Intensive versus moderate lipid lowering with statins after acute coronary syndromes.\n\n【98】primarily reduced the rate of revascularizations with no effect on MI or coronary artery disease (CAD) mortality, whereas the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial did reduce the rates of nonfatal MI. Furthermore, the results from the CTTC meta-analysis using individual data from the 5 trials testing 2 different intensities of statin therapy showed a 4% absolute risk reduction for the primary outcome, no reduction in CHD mortality, and modest 1.5% and 1% absolute risk reductions in coronary events and nonfatal MI, respectively, at 5 years.\n\n【99】The effects of lowering LDL cholesterol with statin therapy in people at low risk of vascular disease: meta-analysis of individual data from 27 randomised trials.\n\n【100】In addition, subgroup analyses of patients with low LDL-C levels were not statistically significant. The PROVE-IT trial clearly showed an effect modification, meaning that baseline LDL-C levels influenced the results, with benefit limited to those with LDL-C levels greater than 125 mg/dL. The CTTC meta-analysis did not show a subgroup analysis on the basis of baseline LDL-C level according to treatment allocation. The CTTC investigators concluded, however, that high-intensity therapy was beneficial regardless of the LDL-C level based on the interpretation of data analyzed by level of LDL-C reduction, not by treatment allocation. Furthermore, they found a statistically significant reduction in the primary outcome in individuals with an LDL-C level less than 70 mg/dL who achieved an LDL-C reduction of 1 mmol compared with those who did not. However, they did not show an analysis comparing outcomes according to treatment allocation. As mentioned previously herein, the pooled baseline LDL-C values were not exactly baseline for all patients because 12,604 patients from the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH) trial had their LDL-C levels measured after a run-in period with 20 mg of simvastatin. They concluded, however, that high-intensity therapy was beneficial regardless of the LDL-C level based on the interpretation of these observational, not experimental, analyses. Studies of statins vs placebo in secondary prevention, in fact, excluded patients with low LDL-C levels at baseline, so it is unclear whether such patients would benefit from any statin use. Although very few patients with established ASCVD would have a very low LDL-C level in the absence of lipid-lowering treatment, those few patients may be exposed to unnecessary harm and a questionable clinical benefit with a high-intensity statin regimen.\n\n【101】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【102】High-dose statin therapy, if tolerated, is recommended for patients with established ASCVD, particularly after MI and stroke, recognizing the modest incremental benefit of high-intensity over moderate-intensity treatment. We do not recommend for or against high-intensity statin treatment for persons with LDL-C levels less than 70 mg/dL not already taking lipid-lowering medication. The decision to start moderate-intensity statin therapy as opposed to high-intensity therapy can be considered and discussed with the patient, recognizing the lack of evidence for such therapy in this population.\n\n【103】### Individuals Younger Than 40 Years With a High Lifetime or 30-Year ASCVD Risk With LDL-C Levels of 160 to 189 mg/dL or Elevated Non–HDL-C Levels (>190 mg/dL)\n\n【104】The newly published cholesterol management guideline does not give specific recommendations for statin treatment for individuals with mild hypercholesterolemia and multiple risk factors if they are younger than 40 years. In this age group, the 10-year calculated ASCVD risk will nearly always be less than the treatment threshold of 7.5%. In fact, it is nearly impossible for a patient younger than 40 years to have a high risk using the Pooled Cohort Risk Calculator. Although the GTBC suggests using the 30-year and lifetime cardiovascular risk calculators, they fall short of encouraging the initiation of statin treatment on the basis of long-term risk estimates. The problem with this approach is assuming that the only outcomes that matter for patients are those that fall within a 10-year horizon. When dealing with other cardiovascular risk factors, risk reduction treatment is not withheld in individuals with a relatively low short-term risk of ASCVD. For example, providers would generally consider recommending that a 25-year-old smoker quit smoking, would refer him or her to a smoking cessation clinic, or would even prescribe pharmacologic treatment to help him or her quit smoking. Likewise, providers would not withhold treatment for a 41-year-old woman with a persistent blood pressure greater than 160/95 mm Hg just because her risk of cardiovascular events in the next 10 years is low. Still, the limited evidence on the risk and benefit of long-term treatment with statins seems to make policy makers and some providers hesitant when recommending statin therapy in young adults. Therefore, a discussion of statin therapy, with the younger patient in particular, should include the limitations in evidence for or against long-term statin use and the assumption that treatment of younger patients with ASCVD risk factors will prevent the initiation or progression of atherosclerosis and thereby reduce the risk of ASCVD events in the longer-term, ie, more than 10 years into the future.\n\n【105】Individuals younger than 40 years may be treated with low- to intermediate-intensity statins with minimal or negligible risk of complications and at a very low cost. However, women who are younger than 40 years should be advised that the safety of statin therapy during pregnancy has not been established. Studies are limited that have assessed the cost-effectiveness of long-term statin therapy initiated at younger ages. Despite this fact, the cost-effectiveness of shorter-term statin therapy seems favorable and is likely to be even more favorable in the era of generic statin medications. The final decision should be based on a shared decision-making process with the patient understanding the uncertainties around this decision.\n\n【106】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【107】Lifestyle therapy is recommended as a first-line therapy in individuals younger than 40 years because there are no safety data with very long-term statin therapy. The Task Force also recommends moderate-intensity statin treatment for individuals 21 to 39 years of age with moderate hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C level of 160-189 mg/dL) or a non–HDL-C level greater than 190 mg/dL, likely polygenic in nature, with a 30-year ASCVD risk greater than 30% or a family history of premature ASCVD if the LDL-C level is greater than 100 mg/dL. There is no role for coronary calcium computed tomography (CT), ankle-brachial index measurement, or searching for carotid artery plaque in this age group because the yield to identify atherosclerotic plaque or subclinical peripheral vascular disease is very low in this age group. The potential role of other measures, such as lipoprotein(a), for risk stratification is discussed in a companion article addressing the Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk.\n\n【108】2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.\n\n【109】### Troubles With a Specific Risk Cutoff Point to Define High Cardiovascular Risk\n\n【110】The new definition of high risk (≥7.5% 10-year risk of ASCVD events) is based on a significantly lower value than the 20% used in the previous guideline. This new definition, although somewhat arbitrary, is more aligned with other preventive recommendations in other areas of medicine, such as recommendations for the ideal target population and frequency of colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer. Currently, guidelines recommend that individuals older than 50 years (who are at <5% 10-year risk of colon cancer) undergo a screening colonoscopy every 10 years, whereas individuals with a strong family history of colon cancer (who have a 10-year risk >10%) be considered for more frequent screening examinations.\n\n【111】The treatment threshold of 7.5% or greater in the new guideline was derived considering the threshold at which the benefit of taking statins would be higher than the risk of developing type 2 DM from statin use. The benefit was calculated as the rate of primary prevention of ASCVD hard outcomes using data from exclusively primary prevention trials, and the risk of DM was estimated to be approximately 1 in 1000 per year for low-intensity statin therapy and 3 in 1000 per year for high-intensity treatment. This approach has 2 main limitations. The first is that a mathematical model giving a similar clinical value to an incidental diagnosis of DM and to a cardiovascular event is questionable, even assuming that those who will develop DM as a consequence of the use of statins will have an increased cardiovascular risk. Another limitation of the fixed cutoff value to define high risk is neglecting patient preferences and values. Extensive research has found that patients can and should participate in difficult clinical decisions through the process of shared decision making. The risks and benefits of a treatment according to guidelines, developers, and researchers may be very different from how patients interpret their own personal risk. Effective tools are available to help providers and patients assess the risks and expected benefits from statin therapy using shared decision-making techniques.\n\n【112】In this setting, some patients might decide that taking a pill every day for the next 10 years might not be desirable to them if only 2 or 3 patients of 100 will actually benefit from 10 years of statin treatment (ie, a 2%-3% absolute risk reduction in people with a 10-year risk of an ASCVD event of 10%) . This concept is also applicable when deciding to use high- vs moderate-intensity statin treatment in patients with ASCVD. It is possible that after learning that it would take 100 patients to be on the high-intensity statin regimen for 5 years to prevent 1 recurrent nonfatal MI with no reduction in total or CVD mortality and that 1 or 2 patients will become diabetic because of the statin therapy in the same period, some patients would prefer to take a moderate-intensity statin regimen instead. The new guideline recommends that we “engage in a clinician-patient discussion of potential for ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, and patient preferences,” but the fact that a cutoff value to define high risk has already been established without patient input can be an impediment to the shared decision-making process, potentially making the provider-patient decision making less patient centered and, ultimately, making the patient feel less involved in the decision-making process.\n\n【113】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【114】Use shared decision making between the patient and the clinician when discussing lipid-lowering drug therapy for ASCVD risk reduction. Strongly consider using tools or decision aids to help improve patient understanding of individualized risks, benefits, and costs of treatment. This applies not only to situations in which a specific cutoff value for risk is proposed to determine the initiation of statin therapy but also when deciding to use high-intensity statin therapy in patients with established ASCVD or DM.\n\n【115】### Statin Treatment in People With Subclinical ASCVD\n\n【116】The guideline gives clear recommendations for people with clinical ASCVD but does not provide specific recommendations for individuals who are found to have subclinical ASCVD and who are labeled as low risk by the Pooled Cohort Risk Calculator. The use of CT coronary angiograms, the incidental finding during regular chest CT showing coronary calcification, and the implementation of coronary calcium CT screening programs have increased the prevalence of patients aware of having coronary atherosclerosis, and clinicians face uncertainty on how to manage their lipids. The incorporation of coronary calcium information into the cardiovascular risk assessment is more straightforward than estimating the added prognostic value of incidental findings using other radiographic techniques because of the paucity of data assessing incremental risk in the presence of calcification during noncardiac CT. In an individual who will otherwise be labeled as low risk according to the Pooled Cohort Risk Calculator but is found to have subclinical ASCVD, it would be reasonable to start statin treatment under the general assumption that in a patient who has subclinical ASCVD, statins may halt the progression of the disease. The choice between moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy in those individuals would depend on the presence of other risk factors, the estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, and patient preferences.\n\n【117】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【118】Initiate statin treatment in patients with subclinical ASCVD, especially if the disease is extensive (eg, a coronary calcium score ≥75th percentile for age and sex) or an absolute Agatston score of 300 or greater, or if a CT angiogram shows evidence of obstructive disease (>60% stenosis), even in the absence of ischemia or cardiovascular symptoms or if multiple small plaques (<30% stenosis) are present. Patients with other manifestations of subclinical atherosclerosis, such as carotid plaque or asymptomatic peripheral vascular disease, may also benefit from statin therapy.\n\n【119】### Lipid-Lowering Treatment in Statin-Intolerant Patients\n\n【120】The GTBC recognizes the vacuum of information regarding cholesterol treatment in people who are intolerant to statins, recommends monitoring of muscle symptoms after initiation of statin therapy, and provides an excellent stepwise approach in how to address muscle symptoms that may or may not be related to statin therapy. The guideline also includes a comprehensive review of the safety of nonstatin lipid-lowering options, but it falls short of giving specific recommendations on what medications to use in people with statin intolerance.\n\n【121】The most important step in the management of patients with presumed statin intolerance is to assess the “intolerance” itself, as some patients may have been labeled as statin intolerant on the basis of an isolated event of muscle discomfort that was attributed to but in reality not related to the use of statins. The diagnosis of statin intolerance goes beyond the scope of this article, but in the situation in which a patient declines statin therapy owing to clear evidence that he or she has developed adverse symptoms from multiple statins, it would be reasonable to consider the use of other, nonstatin medications for cholesterol lowering. The guideline rightfully recognizes the lack of evidence regarding nonstatin lipid-lowering therapies to reduce cardiovascular events. However, the lack of evidence of benefit does not equal evidence of no benefit. In the absence of clinical trials to address this issue, it is reasonable to recommend alternative cholesterol-lowering treatment in statin-intolerant individuals. Such treatment could include therapeutic lifestyle changes and the use of ezetimibe, fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, or other newer treatment alternatives, if tolerated. This recommendation is based on the extensive epidemiologic data showing that the lower the cholesterol level, the lower the rate of ASCVD events. Some studies have found a modest to moderate LDL-C level reduction in people with statin intolerance when using extremely low doses of certain statins, such as rosuvastatin, 5 mg once or twice a week.\n\n【122】Effectiveness and tolerability of every-other-day rosuvastatin dosing in patients with prior statin intolerance.\n\n【123】Patients need to be informed that these alternative therapeutic options have not been fully tested in clinical trials and may not prevent or reduce the risk of ASCVD. However, theoretically, these treatments could potentially have clinical benefit.\n\n【124】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【125】If statin intolerance is not manifested with severe symptoms or life-threatening conditions, consider attempting an alternative statin or a very low-dose statin approach, such as with 5 mg of rosuvastatin either every other day or as infrequently as once or twice a week. If this approach fails, we recommend alternative cholesterol-lowering treatment, including therapeutic lifestyle change and the use of ezetimibe, fibrates, or bile acid sequestrants, if tolerated. Other newer treatment alternatives, such as evolocumab, lomitapide, and mipomersen, could be considered for people intolerant to statins once they become available in clinical practice.\n\n【126】### Statin Treatment for Individuals Older Than 75 Years\n\n【127】There is evidence suggesting that statins might not be effective in lowering ASCVD events in the elderly, particularly for primary prevention. As people age, the added risk attributed to LDL-C level is marginal, and, in addition, lower LDL-C levels have been associated with increased mortality.\n\n【128】It is not valid to assume that because elderly patients have an increased absolute risk of CAD that they will automatically benefit from statin treatment because studies in some patients known to be at high risk for ASCVD have failed to prove any benefit, as was the case in patients undergoing hemodialysis or who have HF. This is particularly relevant because age is the main driver of cardiovascular risk using the Pooled Cohort Risk Equation.\n\n【129】The guideline supports the use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for the secondary prevention of ASCVD in individuals who are 75 years or older but highlight the limited evidence in primary prevention in this age group. We concur with the newly published guideline that high-intensity statin treatment in the elderly should be used only with great caution.\n\n【130】There is some evidence suggesting that cholesterol level reduction could be beneficial for secondary prevention in people older than 75 years based on analysis of pooled data from 26 randomized controlled trials. Although the analysis did not separate patients by age groups and presence or absence of ASCVD,\n\n【131】Efficacy and safety of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol: a meta-analysis of data from 170,000 participants in 26 randomised trials.\n\n【132】the pooled data included primarily people with ASCVD.\n\n【133】The only randomized clinical trial specifically testing statins in the elderly with and without CAD reported no benefit in the primary prevention of CAD.\n\n【134】Pravastatin in elderly individuals at risk of vascular disease (PROSPER): a randomised controlled trial.\n\n【135】Neither the composite end point of CHD death, nonfatal MI, or stroke nor any other prespecified outcome was statistically significant. A recent meta-analysis of statin trials assessing the effect of statins in primary prevention in people 65 years or older using data from 8 randomized clinical trials testing statins found a reduction in stroke and MI but not in cardiovascular or total mortality.\n\n【136】Benefits of statins in elderly subjects without established cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis.\n\n【137】However, most of those trials, except the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER), had an upper age limit of 70 to 75 years. Therefore, the meta-analysis does not add more information than was recommended in the guideline for primary prevention with statins in people 75 years or older. In addition, a sex-based subanalysis of the PROSPER study found that women did not benefit from statin treatment, suggesting that the benefit of statin therapy in women older than 70 years is limited regardless of the presence of CAD. The meta-analysis assessing the effect of statin therapy in primary prevention in the elderly did not report data by sex to answer the question of whether statin therapy in elderly women provides any clinical benefit. Thus, the limited evidence in primary prevention in people older than 75 years does not support the use of statins for the primary prevention of ASCVD.\n\n【138】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【139】Clinicians can consider the theoretical benefit with statin therapy that patients older than 75 years at very high risk for ASCVD could get, especially if they have elevated cholesterol values. Patients in this age group need to know that evidence is extremely limited in people older than 80 years and should also be made aware that the scientific evidence for such treatment has shown no mortality benefit. Clinicians need to keep in mind that the Pooled Cohort Equations developed in this age group to guide treatment is limited to people younger than 80 years and that the calculation of risk in this age group will be high in most patients.\n\n【140】### Lipid Management in Patients With CKD\n\n【141】The expert panel states that statin initiation is not routinely recommended in persons undergoing maintenance hemodialysis. There are also no guidelines to treat patients with CKD who are not receiving renal replacement therapies. It is well-known that patients with CKD are at high cardiovascular risk, and LDL-C is not a robust indicator of the risk, particularly with advancing renal insufficiency.\n\n【142】Association between LDL-C and risk of myocardial infarction in CKD.\n\n【143】Patients with CKD are at high risk for cardiovascular events even when the LDL-C level is low and may benefit from aggressive risk reduction strategies, including statin therapy. Indeed, post hoc subgroup analyses of large statin trials do show risk reduction in patients with CKD, and a recent large-scale randomized controlled trial (the Study of Heart and Renal Protection) reported a significant reduction in atherosclerotic events in patients with CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) of 60 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> or less who were treated with a combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe compared with placebo. However, this trial, and 2 other large randomized trials,\n\n【144】Rosuvastatin and cardiovascular events in patients undergoing hemodialysis.\n\n【145】Randomized controlled trial on the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes on hemodialysis (4D study): demographic and baseline characteristics.\n\n【146】did not find any benefit in patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.\n\n【147】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【148】We recommend statin therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction in all patients 40 years or older with eGFRs of 60 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> or less except those undergoing hemodialysis. Younger patients with CKD may also benefit from statin therapy, especially if they have an estimated 30-year ASCVD risk greater than 30%. Because they are at higher risk for statin-induced myositis, it would be prudent to use only low- to moderate-intensity statin therapy or a combination of a statin and ezetimibe if they cannot tolerate even moderate doses of statins. We would not recommend discontinuation of statin therapy in patients undergoing hemodialysis who are already taking statins that they are tolerating well or in patients starting renal replacement therapies when receiving statin therapy. In the Study of Heart and Renal Protection,\n\n【149】The effects of lowering LDL cholesterol with simvastatin plus ezetimibe in patients with chronic kidney disease (Study of Heart and Renal Protection): a randomised placebo-controlled trial.\n\n【150】approximately a third of the patients who were previously not undergoing hemodialysis went on to require hemodialysis, generally within a year of starting the trial, and yet seemed to benefit regarding cardiovascular risk reduction. Furthermore, none of these studies have found an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis in patients undergoing hemodialysis and receiving statin therapy, and there would be no reason to deny them any minimal benefit that they may get from statin therapy. In patients with eGFRs of 60 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> or greater, we recommend an approach similar to the general population. These recommendations are largely congruent with those issued recently by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes organization.\n\n【151】We recommend the continuation of statin therapy in patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis if the treatment has been well tolerated. We recommend against high-intensity statin therapy and against the initiation of statin therapy in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis.\n\n【152】### Lipid Management in Patients With NYHA Class II to IV HF\n\n【153】Despite the apparently favorable effects of statin therapy in preventing HF and HF outcomes from observational data, small trials, and post hoc analyses of statin trials in patients not initially selected for HF, the results of 2 large randomized clinical trials in patients with HF\n\n【154】Rosuvastatin in older patients with systolic heart failure.\n\n【155】found no benefit of statin therapy on total mortality in patients with class II to IV HF. The Controlled Rosuvastatin in Multinational Trial in Heart Failure (CORONA) did report a benefit in terms of reducing hospitalization for cardiac causes, but that was not seen in the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto Miocardico Heart Failure (GISSI-HF) trial. There seemed to be no benefit in either trial in particular subgroups defined by age older than 70 years, DM, severity of HF, left ventricular ejection fraction higher or lower, ischemic vs nonischemic cause, or baseline lipid levels. Statins (specifically 10 mg of rosuvastatin, which was the active agent used in both trials) seemed safe.\n\n【156】Placebo-controlled statin trials, including the Cardiac Angiography in Renally Impaired Patients (CARE) study, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), and the HPS,\n\n【157】Cholesterol and Recurrent Events Trial investigators  \nThe effect of pravastatin on coronary events after myocardial infarction in patients with average cholesterol levels.\n\n【158】reported a reduced incidence of HF in statin-treated patients. The differences were statistically significant in the HPS and the 4S, but there was only a trend in the CARE study. All of these trials were composed either exclusively (CARE or 4S) or primarily (HPS) of patients with ASCVD. However, the ASCOT was a trial of statin therapy in hypertensive patients, with patients with ASCVD largely excluded, that found no benefit in terms of reduced HF incidence. A meta-analysis of 4 statin comparison trials (PROVE-IT, Aggrastat to Zocor \\[A to Z\\], TNT, and Incremental Decrease in Clinical Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering \\[IDEAL\\]) found that hospitalization for HF was significantly reduced by 27% with intensive statin therapy (80 mg of atorvastatin in the PROVE-IT, TNT, and IDEAL trials; 80 mg of simvastatin in the A to Z trial) in patients with CAD compared with the lower-dose arms of the studies.\n\n【159】Intensive statin therapy and the risk of hospitalization for heart failure after an acute coronary syndrome in the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 study.\n\n【160】These results are based on relatively small numbers, but they do suggest that the development of HF could be prevented with high-dose statin therapy in patients with baseline ASCVD.\n\n【161】Regarding these findings, the new guideline states: “the Expert Panel makes no recommendations regarding the initiation or discontinuation of statins in patients with NYHA class II–IV ischemic systolic HF or in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.”\n\n【162】In clinical practice, the issue of statin therapy in patients with HF will likely be addressed in 1 of 2 ways. First, should a patient who is taking a statin for the primary or secondary prevention of ASCVD but subsequently develops HF now discontinue statin therapy? Second, should a patient who presents with HF and otherwise qualifies for statin therapy for the primary or secondary prevention of ASCVD be excluded from statin therapy? To make recommendations for action in these 2 scenarios, it will be helpful to closely examine the methods of the 2 randomized clinical trials CORONA and GISSI-HF.\n\n【163】Both trials were similar in including patients with NYHA class II to IV HF. In the GISSI-HF trial, ischemic cardiomyopathy was listed as the cause of HF in approximately 40% of patients, whereas all patients in the CORONA had ischemic cardiomyopathy and all were required to have a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less. In the GISSI-HF trial, patients taking a statin or having a history of or risk factors for statin intolerance were excluded. The statin exclusion criterion for the CORONA was slightly different: patients could be considered only if “the investigator thought they did not need treatment with a cholesterol-lowering drug.” Baseline lipid levels seemed slightly higher in the CORONA vs the GISSI-HF trial (average LDL-C level of 137 mg/dL vs 122 mg/dL). According to the new guideline, most patients with ischemic heart disease in both trials probably should have been receiving statin therapy before the development of HF. Both trials also used 10 mg of rosuvastatin as the active agent. This would be considered a moderate statin dose under the new guideline, whereas patients with ASCVD should be treated with high-dose statin according to that same guideline.\n\n【164】What the GISSI-HF and CORONA trials likely tell us is that patients with existing HF that is not due to an ischemic event and who have relatively low lipid levels will not benefit from statin therapy. In other words, statins do not treat HF independently of treating risk factors for CAD. The question of statin treatment in CAD is likewise pretty clear in terms of preventing cardiovascular events, perhaps even HF, as the post hoc analyses of the statin-placebo and statin-comparison studies suggest. We, therefore, suggest that it would be prudent to continue statin therapy in already treated patients with ASCVD after they develop HF, assuming that the HF can be well controlled and that overall risk is low enough to suggest that survival will be long enough for statins to achieve some benefit. The CORONA and GISSI-HF trials excluded these patients, so they are of no real help, as the GTBC suggests, in guiding our decision making. Subgroup analysis biomarkers, such as N-Terminal brain natriuretic peptide, and even the results of cardiopulmonary exercise tests might be useful in determining which patients have a low enough overall mortality risk to warrant continuation of statin therapy. In fact, a model for predicting survival in HF using these 2 variables plus NYHA class and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotension receptor blocker use is now available.\n\n【165】The more complex Seattle Heart Failure Model for predicting survival has also been published\n\n【166】The Seattle Heart Failure Model: prediction of survival in heart failure.\n\n【167】and is also available in an online version . The exact cutoff point for when to consider starting or continuing statin therapy is, of course, arbitrary, but expected survival of less than 2 years certainly brings into question the likelihood that statin therapy will be of significant benefit.\n\n【168】For the second group of patients, those who have developed HF, especially from an ischemic cause, and are not currently taking a statin but otherwise fall into 1 of the 4 groups that qualify for statin therapy under the new guideline, the 2 statin in HF trials do not provide much support for initiating statins. Outcomes were not better in patients with higher baseline lipid levels, which might be expected if lipid lowering did play a positive role. Similarly, stratification for hsCRP level, which is favorably affected by statin therapy, did not affect results. Death from all causes within 3 years of randomization was greater than 20% in the GISSI-HF trial and greater than 30% in the CORONA (patients were an average of 5 years older at baseline than in the GISSI-HF trial), whereas mortality at 5 years in the “high-risk” cohort of the HPS was only 3% in simvastatin-treated patients and 4% in the placebo group. High background mortality from the combination of advanced age and HF was probably a major factor in the lack of efficacy in the 2 statin in HF trials and would limit efficacy in clinical practice also.\n\n【169】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【170】Initiation of statin therapy is not routinely recommended for patients with NYHA class II to IV HF. Continue statin therapy for patients with HF who are taking statins and are free of adverse effects. We recommend considering initiation of statin therapy in patients with HF who meet all 4 of the following criteria: (1) HF is well-controlled and with a projection of good survival (life expectancy >2 years); (2) ASCVD is the underlying cause of HF; (3) the baseline non–HDL-C level is 160 mg/dL or greater or the LDL-C level is 130 mg/dL or greater; and (4) age is younger than 75 years.\n\n【171】### Lipid Management in Patients With Rheumatologic Inflammatory Disease\n\n【172】Patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other connective tissue diseases are known to be at increased risk for CAD.\n\n【173】Both increased prevalence of traditional risk factors and nontraditional risk factors related to chronic systemic inflammation are thought to contribute to this increased risk. The European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines recognize the increased risk of ASCVD in these patients but discourage the preventive use of lipid-lowering drugs on the basis of the presence of autoimmune diseases.\n\n【174】ESC/EAS Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias: the Task Force for the management of dyslipidaemias of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS).\n\n【175】The European League Against Rheumatism has issued recommendations to help clinicians identify and manage cardiovascular risk in these patients\n\n【176】EULAR evidence-based recommendations for cardiovascular risk management in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of inflammatory arthritis.\n\n【177】and suggest that in certain patients with a high burden of inflammatory disease, there should be a reduced threshold to start statin therapy. Although there are no intervention trials looking at cardiovascular outcomes in patients with connective tissue disease treated with statins, post hoc subgroup analyses of the TNT and IDEAL studies suggest that lipid lowering and risk reduction in patients with inflammatory joint disease are similar to those without.\n\n【178】Effect of intensive lipid-lowering therapy on cardiovascular outcome in patients with and those without inflammatory joint disease.\n\n【179】The Trial of Atorvastatin for the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients was stopped prematurely because of low primary event rates.\n\n【180】Whether the advent of more effective disease-modifying therapies will also reduce the prevalence of CAD in patients with rheumatologic disease needs to be investigated.\n\n【181】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【182】At this time, it seems prudent to initiate statin therapy for primary prevention in patients with connective tissue disease whose estimated 10-year risk for ASCVD is greater than 5% or 30-year risk is greater than 20% under the assumption that inflammatory connective tissue diseases increase the risk for ASCVD approximately 1.5- to 2-fold, independent of traditional ASCVD risk factors, particularly if the non–HDL-C level is greater than 130 to 160 mg/dL or the LDL-C level is greater than 100 to 130 mg/dL. This should be combined with the implementation of healthy lifestyle changes and effective management of other risk factors, such as hypertension and smoking, and of the primary rheumatologic process.\n\n【183】### Lipid Management in Patients With Human Immunodeficiency Virus\n\n【184】Increased cardiovascular risk has also been noted in human immunodeficiency virus–infected patients, and a large 10-year observational study reported a high proportion of cardiovascular deaths in this patient cohort despite their relatively young age and low prevalence of other traditional risk factors except smoking.\n\n【185】Factors associated with specific causes of death amongst HIV-positive individuals in the D:A:D Study.\n\n【186】Dyslipidemia and body fat changes may result from antiretroviral therapy and may contribute to the increased risk. There are no trials examining the benefit of lipid-lowering therapies on cardiovascular end points in these patients, but small studies have reported the safety and efficacy of statins, fibrates, fish oil, and niacin in improving lipid parameters.\n\n【187】Combination of niacin and fenofibrate with lifestyle changes improves dyslipidemia and hypoadiponectinemia in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy: results of “heart positive,” a randomized, controlled trial.\n\n【188】Pravastatin in HIV-infected patients treated with protease inhibitors: a placebo-controlled randomized study.\n\n【189】Fish oil and fenofibrate for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia in HIV-infected subjects on antiretroviral therapy: results of ACTG A5186.\n\n【190】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【191】In the absence of clinical trial data, it would be reasonable to start statin therapy in patients with human immunodeficiency virus receiving antiretroviral therapy when their estimated 10-year risk of ASCVD is greater than 5% or their 30-year risk is greater than 20%, assuming that human immunodeficiency virus while receiving antiretroviral therapy increases the risk of ASCVD approximately 1.5-fold independent of traditional ASCVD risk factors, particularly if their non–HDL-C level is greater than 160 mg/dL or their LDL-C level is greater than 130 mg/dL.\n\n【192】Pravastatin, which is not metabolized to a substantial extent by the cytochrome P450 enzymes, is the statin of choice to avoid drug interactions with protease inhibitors and other antiretroviral agents. Coadministration of simvastatin and protease inhibitors should be avoided, and if other statins, such as rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, and fluvastatin, are used, therapy should commence with a low dose. Combination therapy with fibrates, niacin, or fish oil is often required, especially in those with hypertriglyceridemia, and a careful consideration of drug-drug interactions must be undertaken in all patients.\n\n【193】### Lipid Management in Patients With Solid Organ Transplants\n\n【194】Another group of patients who are likely to benefit from statin therapy are recipients of solid organ transplants, especially kidney and heart. The 10-year risk of cardiovascular events in renal transplant recipients is greater than 20%, and statin therapy has been found to reduce the risk of cardiac death or nonfatal MI by 35%.\n\n【195】Effect of fluvastatin on cardiac outcomes in renal transplant recipients: a multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled trial.\n\n【196】Similarly, improved survival and less cardiac allograft vasculopathy has been reported in patients after cardiac transplant treated with statins,\n\n【197】Effect of pravastatin on outcomes after cardiac transplantation.\n\n【198】Simvastatin initiated early after heart transplantation: 8-year prospective experience.\n\n【199】and current guidelines recommend initiation of statin therapy in all cardiac transplant recipients irrespective of cholesterol levels.\n\n【200】The International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines for the care of heart transplant recipients.\n\n【201】Although there are some limited data to suggest benefits of early, aggressive statin therapy over titrated dosing,\n\n【202】Safety and efficacy of early aggressive versus cholesterol-driven lipid-lowering strategies in heart transplantation: a pilot, randomized, intravascular ultrasound study.\n\n【203】it is important to consider the increased risk of adverse effects due to concomitant medications, such as cyclosporine.\n\n【204】#### Mayo Clinic Task Force Recommendations\n\n【205】We recommend starting all cardiac and renal transplant recipients on low- to moderate-intensity statin therapy after careful consideration of drug-drug interactions. Pravastatin and fluvastatin would be the first choice because of their safety data in transplant patients.\n\n【206】Additional Research Needed\n--------------------------\n\n【207】Statins are one of the most studied drugs in randomized clinical trials in the history of medicine. However, there are still several relevant questions that have not been answered in those trials that merit future investigation. A key question to be answered is whether pursuing a specific LDL-C or non–HDL-C target will lead to better clinical outcomes than a fixed statin dose. There is ample observational evidence that the lower the LDL-C level, the better the clinical outcomes, but this has not been tested in clinical trials. A clinical trial testing the “threshold” hypothesis would determine whether the target LDL-C approach, either with statins alone or with the addition of nonstatin drugs, leads to better risk reduction than matching risk level to intensity of statin therapy without specific LDL-C goals.\n\n【208】There is little experimental evidence supporting the recommendation to give statins to people without DM or ASCVD but with elevated ASCVD risk and LDL-C levels less than 130 mg/dL, particularly in the absence of subclinical atherosclerosis or inflammation. A trial enrolling individuals with a high ASCVD risk and a normal or low LDL-C level will answer this question. Furthermore, there are no clinical trials proving that high-intensity statin treatment will benefit patients at very high risk for ASCVD compared with moderate- or lower-intensity statin treatment. Although ample evidence suggests that the intensity of the statin treatment should match the risk of ASCVD, no trial in primary prevention has been performed to prove this.\n\n【209】Clinical trials testing the efficacy of statins in patients with DM for primary prevention have all used relatively low doses of statins, and they all had very high rates of CVD outcomes, much higher than the average rates observed in patients with DM in the community. Therefore, it would be desirable to have clinical trials proving that patients with DM with a low ASCVD risk using the Pooled Cohort Risk Calculator will benefit from statin treatment, and also trials comparing high- vs low-intensity statin therapy in diabetic patients with elevated ASCVD risk. The dose-dependent statin-related risk of insulin resistance and DM adds urgency for such trials.\n\n【210】There is scant evidence from clinical trials using statins in the elderly. Because elderly people represent a large and growing number of patients who qualify for statin treatment according to current guidelines, clinical trials need to demonstrate that statins are safe and effective to prevent ASCVD events in people older than 75 years.\n\n【211】Statin use seems to be safe in the long-term, but more data are needed confirming the safety of statin therapy in the very long–term. Because most statin clinical trials had a run-in period during which patients who did not tolerate the drug or for other unknown reasons declined to enter into the randomized portion of those trials, the real incidence of statin intolerance in the population is still yet to be determined. Prospective series of patients newly prescribed statins and particularly clinical trials without a run-in period will help answer this question.\n\n【212】Finally, there is a need for clinical trials testing the efficacy and safety of statins for the primary prevention of ASCVD in special populations at increased risk for ASCVD and in which case series and small trials suggest some benefit from using statins even when the LDL-C level is not elevated.\n\n【213】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【214】The new ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline represents an important step forward in the management of ASCVD by giving evidence-based recommendations and focusing on specific clinical questions. Although helpful and important, this guideline has gap areas that involve clinical scenarios, subgroups, and situations that are not covered fully by the guideline. This article addresses some of the clinical questions that relate to these gap areas. The decision regarding when to prescribe statins will ultimately rely on clinical judgment and shared decision making between the provider and the patient. There is a need for more randomized clinical trials to address some gaps in knowledge.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

In the 18 years after transplant, the cumulative incidence of infectious diseases was 93%; the most common infectious complications were skin and soft tissue (63%), urinary tract (46%), cytomegalovirus (40%), lung (36%), upper respiratory tract (23%), and varicella zoster virus (15%) infections. After adjustment for baseline predictors, lung (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 3.87; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 2.49-6.02; _P_ <.001) and central nervous system (HR, 4.48; 95% CI, 1.75-11.46; _P_ \\=.002) infections were predictive of mortality. Serum creatinine levels (HR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.07-2.81; _P_ \\=.02) and sirolimus use (HR, 2.72; 95% CI, 1.00-7.36; _P_ \\=.05) were predictive of lung infection. Death occurred during the study period in 95 (30%) of 313 patients, with a cumulative incidence of 71% at 18 years. The cause of death was infection in 17 (18%) of 95 patients.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Early postoperative infectious complications are frequent in cardiac allograft recipients but are not associated with 1-year mortality. Lung and central nervous system infections are predictors of mortality.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】CI ( confidence interval ), CMV ( cytomegalovirus ), CNS ( central nervous system ), HR ( hazard ratio ), HSV ( herpes simplex virus ), IQR ( interquartile range ), VZV ( varicella zoster virus )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}
