We considered AF diagnosed at 30 days or fewer before or any time after GD and de novo HFrEF not explained by ischemia, valve disorder, or other cardiomyopathy at/after GD diagnosis. Electrocardiograms at/after index condition were excluded. A subset analysis included females younger than 45 years of age to study the association between ECG-derived female probability and menstrual changes (shorter, lighter, or newly irregular cycles).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Among 430 patients (mean age, 50±17 years; 337 (78.4%) female), independent risk factors for AF included ECG probability of AF (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 1.5; 95% CI, 1.2 to 1.6 per 10%; _P_ <.001), older age (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.07 per year; _P_ <.001), and overt hyperthyroidism (HR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.2 to 12.7; _P_ \\=.03). The C-statistic was 0.85 for the combined model.

{"seq_id": "3294d024-e77f-46ee-be78-0bdd3c856720", "title": "Biomechanics of Falling", "text": "【0】Biomechanics of Falling\nIn the current issue of the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , the article by Sinaki et al\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】Significant reduction in risk of falls and back pain in osteoporotic-kyphotic women through a spinal proprioceptive extension exercise dynamic (SPEED) program.\n\n【3】provides an excellent example of how an understanding of basic biomechanics can serve as a foundation for improving patient care. Specifically, the authors applied the principles of biomechanics to help women with kyphoscoliosis reduce the risk of falling. The prospective trial compared treatment in 12 osteoporotickyphotic women to 13 healthy matched controls-all older than 60 years-before and after an intervention strategy that consisted of wearing a spinal weighted kypho-orthosis (WKO) along with participating in a dynamic exercise program. The WKO is essentially a weighted “backpack” that adds weight posterior to the spine to counterbalance some of the load of the torso that is concentrated anterior to the spine. By performing the exercise program after implementing the WKO device, the subjects would theoretically receive the compounded benefits of altered biomechanics (from the WKO) and the known, independent benefits of the exercise program, plus any added interaction between the 2 treatment modalities.\n\n【4】The study by Sinaki et al identified benefit from the intervention. After 4 weeks of treatment, significant changes were noted in balance and gait parameters, back extensor strength had improved, and back pain had decreased significantly. These improvements have implications for reducing the incidence of falls in the described study participants.\n\n【5】Falls present a serious risk of injury in the elderly population. Falls can also lead to permanent changes in lifestyle, such as hospitalization, long-term rehabilitation, and the inability to function independently, which can cause further declines in health. The relationship of improving the incidence of falls as a result of biomechanical alterations, as suggested by Sinaki et al, seems highly logical. Biome-chanics is concerned with the application of mechanical principles to biological systems. A fall is a biomechanical event, in that an external force, gravity, destabilizes the body's alignment of the torso over the legs. A fall occurs when the center of gravity of the trunk moves outside the base of support provided by the feet against the floor. The center of gravity is an imaginary point at which all the weight of the torso can be considered concentrated. If the center of gravity moves outside (anterior, posterior, or lateral) the base of support, a fall will result. Various aids can be used to assist with balance problems and to help prevent falls. An obvious aid is the walker, which provides a greater base of support and also allows the person the use of his or her arms to support some of the weight of the torso located anterior to the spine.\n\n【6】As a simple illustration of the function of the spinal WKO, consider a book being pushed toward the edge of a shelf. Assuming that the book's center of gravity is at its geometric center, as the book is pushed it protrudes over the edge, and its center of gravity moves closer to the edge, which is the limit of its base of support. As the distance between the center of gravity and the edge of the shelf decreases, the book starts to become less stable. Ultimately, when the center of gravity is moved beyond the edge of the shelf, its limit of support, the book will fall off the shelf.\n\n【7】Just as keeping the book on the shelf requires some distance between the center of gravity and the edge of the shelf (the edge of support), the person's trunk has a center of gravity, located at the level of the sternum and anterior to the spine, that must be kept within its base of support, the feet. (This center of gravity is separate from the whole-body center of gravity located within the pelvis.) The edge of support for forward movement (anterior flexion) of the trunk is approximately a line passing through the tarsometatarsal joints of the foot. If the torso flexes forward so that the center of gravity of the trunk is located beyond this edge, the person will fall.\n\n【8】In simple terms, to remain upright requires a balance between gravity pulling the torso downward and the reaction force from the floor upward through the feet, which counteracts gravity. With this background in persons with kyphoscoliosis and anterior displacement of the center of gravity, the use of the WKO, as studied by Sinaki et al, makes sense. Adding a weight to the posterior aspect of the torso moves the center of gravity of the torso rearward. This alone would reduce the tendency to fall. The person's center of gravity moves rearward, away from the edge of support defined by the joints of the toes. The additive changes of the 4-week exercise program were not separately examined in the report by Sinaki et al; however, one would envision that this program would provide several advantages, including improving the person's motor skills and muscle memory in response to a new center of gravity, strengthening the requisite muscles for improving balance, and accelerating the process of anatomical alterations that may result from use of the WKO device.\n\n【9】Regarding this latter benefit, in addition to an immediate change in weight distribution, the WKO also adjusts posture, reducing kyphosis. Consider the playground seesaw as an example. One child sitting far away from the center bar, about which the seesaw pivots, can hold up an adult sitting much closer but weighing more than the child. This is an example of the requirement of the balance of _moments_ , the engineering term for a bending force. A weight acting over a distance creates a bending moment. (A lever allows the smaller force applied by the worker further away from the pivot point to be transferred to the larger weight, closer to the pivot point, that is being lifted.) If the lower lumbar spine is considered the fulcrum, the center of gravity of the torso acts at a certain horizontal distance anterior to it, causing the torso to bend forward. This is counteracted by the pull of the spinal extensor muscles acting posterior to the spinal fulcrum. Providing a relatively small weight (eg, 1.0 kg, as used in the WKO device) but at a greater distance posterior to the spinal fulcrum adds to the muscle-bending moment, counteracting the kyphosis, and allows the person to stand more erect.\n\n【10】Therefore, the WKO has 2 beneficial effects. It displaces the center of gravity posterior to the edge of support along the joints of the toes, increasing stability against incidents that would cause the person to pitch forward and fall. Also, the WKO allows the person to stand more erect because of its addition to the extension moment generated by the back muscles; thus, the person is in a better position to look ahead and avoid obstacles while walking.\n\n【11】In summary, the report by Sinaki et al validates the efficacy of using the WKO and a dynamic exercise program to improve biomechanics in persons with kyphoscoliosis. This in turn can reduce the possibility of the person falling and prevent the downstream, potentially life-altering consequences of falling. Further research is now needed to determine the feasibility of using this intervention in large populations of kyphoscoliosis patients, so that issues of patient compliance plus treatment effects and adverse effects can be better elucidated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The outcomes of these potential adverse sequelae often are of markedly different magnitude. This is especially important because strokes associated with atrial fibrillation (the most common indication for anticoagulation use) frequently are large, devastating events.\n\n【52】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【53】Stroke severity in atrial fibrillation: the Framingham Study.\n\n【54】Although there is variability, patients also generally express a clear preference to avoid stroke even at the cost of significant bleeding—assessing the outcomes of stroke to be much more severe than those of a significant gastrointestinal bleed.\n\n【55】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【56】Values and preferences for oral antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation: physician and patient perspectives.\n\n【57】However, the ASGE guidelines implicitly weight procedural bleeding as the greater harm. Thus, despite emphasis on a patient-centric approach to medicine, with patient preferences helping guide decisions when no clearly superior medical approach exists, current guidelines for anticoagulation discontinuation for colonoscopy not only do not consider but actually conflict with patient preferences.\n\n【58】In clinical practice, anticoagulation discontinuation deviates ever further from optimal care. In an effort to avoid the potential of having to reschedule a repeated procedure, many practitioners in our communities discontinue anticoagulation for all colonoscopies because of the possibility of having to perform a polypectomy. Because only approximately one-third of all screening and diagnostic colonoscopy patients undergo a polypectomy, only approximately 0.2% (0.6% ÷ 3) of such colonoscopy patients interrupting anticoagulation therapy potentially benefit via a reduced bleeding risk compared with a 1% chance of experiencing a stroke or other serious thromboembolic event with anticoagulation interruption. We acknowledge that bleeding risks of polypectomy higher than those mentioned previously herein have been reported and likely are related to the anatomical complexity of the polyps. Yet the low bleeding risks noted previously herein, cited in the endoscopy guidelines, show that many polyps, especially most that are smaller than 10 mm, can be safely removed without anticoagulation interruption.\n\n【59】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【60】Removal of small colorectal polyps in anticoagulated patients: a prospective randomized comparison of cold snare and conventional polypectomy.\n\n【61】This fact is rarely discussed when the risks and benefits of anticoagulation interruption for colonoscopy are considered. Delayed bleeding occurs more often in patients receiving oral anticoagulation after polypectomy even when anticoagulation was interrupted for the procedure.\n\n【62】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【63】Incidence and predictors of bleeding or thrombosis after polypectomy in patients receiving and not receiving anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【64】But this bleeding is generally not associated with significant morbidity or mortality, and it typically occurs at a time when anticoagulation would have been resumed regardless of an interruption strategy.\n\n【65】The current ASGE guidelines generally are evidence based and clinically nuanced (eg, including recommendations for heparinoid “bridging” in patients at high thromboembolic risk). However, evidence for bridging is weak, with most studies showing no benefit and often increased periprocedural bleeding risk. And bridging, if it does not decrease periprocedural thromboembolic risk, will likewise offer no benefit regarding the delayed bleeding risk after polypectomy at 7 to 10 days because almost uniformly full oral anticoagulation would have been resumed by this time. Avoiding any anticoagulation until this period has passed would be problematic given the stroke risks outlined previously herein for even shorter interruptions. But we think that the more appropriate question is whether anticoagulation should be interrupted rather than whether bridging might reduce the inherent thromboembolic risk of interruption.\n\n【66】Thus, patient safety may be best served by not interrupting anticoagulation for colonoscopy procedures but rather scheduling a second procedure with a brief interruption of anticoagulation for patients discovered to require very high-risk polypectomy, such as size greater than 10 mm or broad base. We developed a decision flow chart balancing the risks and benefits of anticoagulation interruption to assist in this process .\n\n【67】Figure Anticoagulation interruption decision flow chart for patients undergoing colonoscopy.\n\n【68】Examination of other procedures may produce similar assessments of the risks vs benefits of anticoagulation interruption. Pacemaker implantation and atrial fibrillation ablation have been performed safely without anticoagulation interruption,\n\n【69】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【70】Pacemaker or defibrillator surgery without interruption of anticoagulation.\n\n【71】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【72】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【73】Periprocedural stroke and bleeding complications in patients undergoing catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation with different anticoagulation management: results from the Role of Coumadin in Preventing Thromboembolism in Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Patients Undergoing Catheter Ablation (COMPARE) randomized trial.\n\n【74】for example, with no increased bleeding compared with usual care.\n\n【75】Why do physicians continue to make these decisions both in clinical guidelines and in clinical practice that seem to be disadvantageous to patients on more thorough analysis? In part, physician behavior is a reflection of common decision-making heuristics and biases, including Prospect Theory, especially loss aversion, whereby individuals respond more strongly to potential losses than potential gains.\n\n【76】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【77】Procedure-associated bleeding is immediate and its cause obvious, and the loss to the patient and physician of bleeding (including, possibly, to physician reputation) may be more compelling and salient than the gain of continued protection against stroke, a complication that usually occurs outside of the immediate time frame of the procedure and may not even become known to the physician performing the procedure. Thus, anticoagulation recommendations may demonstrate the unintended bias of physicians writing guidelines and in practice to minimize immediate procedural complications, which we refer to as _procedural myopia_ .\n\n【78】How best to assist our patients with these decisions? Given patient preference variability, we believe that these decisions require an individualized conversation regarding a patient's perceptions of the probability and impact of potential benefits, harms, and inconveniences. So although it is not certain that a patient-centric approach will always result in stroke avoidance, the path forward needs to be chosen after shared decision making with a patient who has been well informed about the potential consequences of each course of action. Such discussions often do not take place today.\n\n【79】In summary, the evidence base does not support current clinical practice guidelines for the common question of whether to interrupt anticoagulation for colonoscopy and probably other low-risk procedures. In addition, clinical practice guidelines often do not adequately incorporate patient preferences concerning alternative potential outcomes. Given that stroke seems to be a much more serious outcome than local bleeding complications, interruptions of anticoagulation recommended by clinical practice guidelines may be inappropriate. Thus, we recommend (1) careful evidence-based review of the likelihood and clinical impact of possible adverse effects of continuing or interrupting anticoagulation, which should precede any interruption decision; (2) recognition of the unintended bias of physicians writing guidelines to minimize immediate procedural complications, which must be addressed; and (3) shared decision making with patients that includes informed individualized weighting and discussion of possible benefits and harms of medical actions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Berg performed fundamental studies of the biochemistry of nucleic acids, particularly recombinant DNA, and Gilbert determined the sequence of bases in DNA by a method applicable to single-and doublestranded DNA.

In 1962, he was named director of protein and nucleic acid chemistry at the MRC.\n\n【4】Sanger worked for 10 years to elucidate the structure of the bovine insulin molecule, and by 1955, he had determined the exact order of all the amino acids of the molecule—the first protein molecule to be known in such detail. He also reported his laboratory technique for determining the order in which amino acids are linked in proteins. Sanger's work made it possible for other chemists to identify the exact structure of other compounds. For example, Chinese American biochemist Choh Hao Li (1913-) and his group were able to determine the structure of the pituitary hormone adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) in 1956, and in the early 1950s, American biochemist Vincent Du Vigneaud (1901-1978) determined the structure of the comparatively simple amino acid chains of 2 pituitary hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin, and later synthesized them.\n\n【5】In the 1950s, Sanger became interested in genetics and turned his attention to determining the sequence of nucleotides in molecules of DNA and RNA. In 1975, he decoded the DNA of a small virus, for which he received the 1980 Nobel Prize in chemistry. The work—complete nucleo-tide (base) sequence of the genetic material (DNA) of the virus—done at the MRC laboratory was published in 1977.\n\n【6】Besides the Nobel Prize, Sanger received many other honors, including the Corday-Morgan Medal and Prize of the Chemical Society (1951), the Gairdner Foundation Annual Award (1971 and 1979), the William Bate Hardy Prize of the Cambridge Philosophical Society (1976), the Copley Medal of the Royal Society (1977), the Wheland Award (1978), the Horwitz Prize (1979), and the Lasker Award (1979). In1954, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and was named a Companion of Honor in 1981 and a member of the Order of Merit in 1986. In 1963, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. He was honored on a stamp issued by the Palau Islands in 2000.

He was an accomplished horse rider who had fallen several times during his teenage years. Three years earlier, he sustained an injury to the left flank while playing college football, with subsequent flank pain, ecchymoses, and a systolic blood pressure level between 150 and 170 mm Hg. He sought evaluation for blood pressure management. The patient denied having headaches, hematuria, weight change, dyspnea, chest pains, flushing, or decreased libido. This young man used no tobacco, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, illicit drugs, or alcohol. His family history was unremarkable for hypertension.\n\n【1】Physical examination revealed a healthy-looking man in no distress. His blood pressure level was 170/110 mm Hg in each arm, his heart rate was 68 beats/min, and he was afebrile. Cardiovascular examination findings were normal. The lungs sounded clear bilaterally, the abdomen was without bruits or masses, lower extremity pulses were symmetrical with no pulse lag, and the funduscopic examination findings were normal. The initial laboratory test results are shown in Table 1 . Chest radiographic findings were normal without rib notching, and an electrocardiogram suggested no left ventricular hypertrophy.\n\n【2】Table 1 Laboratory Values\n\n| Test | Values on admission |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hemoglobin (g/dL) | 13.4 |\n| Leukocytes (× 10 9 /L) | 6.1 |\n| Platelet count (× 10 9 /L) | 273 |\n| Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (mm/1 h) | 15 |\n| Sodium (mEq/L) | 140 |\n| Potassium (mEq/L) | 4.1 |\n| Calcium (mg/dL) | 9.4 |\n| Phosphorus (mg/dL) | 3.3 |\n| Chloride (mEq/L) | 102 |\n| Bicarbonate (mEq/L) | 24 |\n| Glucose (mg/dL) | 88 |\n| Creatinine (mg/dL) | 1.5\\*Indicates abnormal value.

This form of hypertension tends to present in middle-aged individuals who areusually asymptomatic with normal physical examination and laboratory tests but with concurrent cardiovascular risk factors such as family history, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and obesity. Approximately 5% to 7% of patients do not fit this profile; such patients should be examined for secondary causes of hypertension after causes such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use and illicit drug use are excluded. The most sensitive strategy for identifying patients in this group is to screen all patients who present with hypertension before age 25 years and after age 50 years. Other clues to secondary hypertension include abnormal renal function, evidence of early endorgan damage, unprovoked electrolyte abnormalities, abdominal bruits or asymmetrical pulses on physical examination, and poor response to therapy. Our patient used no drugs and presented with 4 features that suggested an underlying secondary cause: a young age, an abnormal creatinine level, severe hypertension, and the absence of family history for hypertension; therefore, a diagnosis of essential hypertension is unlikely.\n\n【27】Primary aldosteronism is found in 0.3% to 1.5% of patients with hypertension.\n\n【28】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【29】Secondary hypertension in a blood pressure clinic.\n\n【30】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【31】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【32】The effect of age on prevalence of secondary forms of hypertension in 4429 consecutively referred patients.\n\n【33】Primary aldosteronism is recognized more frequently by measuring serum aldosterone levels and plasma renin activity.\n\n【34】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【35】Potentially high prevalence of primary aldosteronism in a primarycare population \\[letter\\].\n\n【36】Although up to 20% of patients with primary aldosteronism may present with concentrations of serum potassium in the low end of normal, the combination of normal potassium and elevated plasma renin activity effectively rules out the diagnosis because almost all patients with primary aldosteronism have suppressed plasma renin activity.\n\n【37】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【38】Primary aldosteronism.\n\n【39】Pheochromocytoma and coarctation of the aorta represent less than 0.2% of all causes of hypertension and less than 10% of secondary causes. The absence of history that suggests pheochromocytoma and the lack of physical examination data that support coarctation of the aorta make both of these rare entities extremely unlikely.\n\n【40】Renal parenchymal disease and renovascular disease cause 5% to 10% of all hypertension, depending on the population studied. Renal parenchymal disease alone is responsible for 40% to 60% of hypertension among children and adolescents. Renovascular disease accounts for up to 25% of secondary forms of hypertension, although two thirds of cases are caused by atherosclerotic disease and affect a much older population. Therefore, both epidemiologically and clinically, the most likely cause of hypertension in this patient is renal disease, and evaluation of the kidneys is the next obvious investigational step.\n\n【41】*   2.\n\n【42】    _Which one of the following diagnostic tests would be the least helpful in this case?_\n\n【43】    *   a.\n\n【44】        _Kidney biopsy_\n\n【45】    *   b.\n\n【46】        _Magnetic resonance arteriography_\n\n【47】    *   c.\n\n【48】        _Conventional arteriography_\n\n【49】    *   d.\n\n【50】        _Duplex ultrasonography_\n\n【51】    *   e.\n\n【52】        _Captopril renal scan_\n\n【53】A renal etiology for this patient's hypertension would direct diagnostic investigation, and several clues from the history, physical examination, and preliminary laboratory studies need to be analyzed. The patient's good health, absence of analgesic or illicit drug use, normal physical examination findings, negative antinuclear antibodies, and, most importantly, normal urinalysis results suggest a diagnosis other than a parenchymal process such as glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, or analgesic nephropathy. Thus, kidney biopsy would be the least helpful test. Renovascular hypertension is a likely diagnosis because plasma renin activity and creatinine were elevated; therefore, a method to evaluate for renal artery stenosis (RAS) would provide valuable information. Also, in this age group, fibromuscular dysplasia is relatively common among those with renovascular hypertension, although it is more prevalent in women. Therefore, the diagnostic investigation should focus primarily on detecting possible RAS. Magnetic resonance or conventional arteriography, duplex ultrasonography, and captopril renal scan are all used in assessing for RAS, and the choice among them depends on the individual patient scenario.\n\n【54】*   3.\n\n【55】    _Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in the investigation and management of this patient's condition?_\n\n【56】    *   a.\n\n【57】        _Intravenous pyelography_\n\n【58】    *   b.\n\n【59】        _Captopril renal scan_\n\n【60】    *   c.\n\n【61】        _Duplex ultrasonography_\n\n【62】    *   d.\n\n【63】        _Magnetic resonance arteriography_\n\n【64】    *   e.\n\n【65】        _Conventional arteriography_\n\n【66】Intravenous pyelography has no role in the diagnosis of RAS since it lacks sensitivity (70%) and specificity (85%). Captopril renal scan serves primarily as a screening tool and has excellent sensitivity and specificity (90%-95%); however, it provides a functional rather than anatomical diagnosis and is recommended when an intermediate clinical suspicion exists. Duplex ultrasonography is noninvasive, widely available, inexpensive, has 80% to 90% sensitivity and specificity, and has become the screening test of choice for RAS. However, it depends heavily on operator experience and is less useful for diagnosing fibromuscular dysplasia, the principal diagnostic consideration in this patient because of his age and renin-dependent hypertension. In this case, however, with the high pretest probability of RAS, a definitive test that provides anatomical diagnosis would be appropriate. The only 2 options that would definitively show RAS are magnetic resonance arteriography or conventional arteriography. Magnetic resonance arteriography of the renal arteries has a reported sensitivity of 94% to 97% and a specificity of 85% to 93%, the higher values being with gadolinium enhancement. The gold standard for diagnosing RAS is arteriography with intravenous contrast media, although this procedure is invasive and is associated with the greatest morbidity. Nevertheless, it is the only modality that offers the possibility of concomitant treatment with percutaneous angioplasty and stenting of the area of stenosis. This was the next step chosen in evaluating this patient.\n\n【67】An alternative diagnostic approach, given the history of trauma in this patient, would be to use ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) to image the kidneys initially, before proceeding with arteriography. This approach, however, was not chosen because of the reasons mentioned earlier.\n\n【68】Conventional arteriography revealed normal renal arteries, but there was intrarenal vascular distortion caused apparently by a mass within the left kidney. Renin sampling of the renal veins was performed and results were abnormal: 10.1 ng • mL <sup>−1 </sup> • h <sup>−1 </sup> on the left and 3.8 ng • mL <sup>−1 </sup> • h <sup>−1 </sup> on the right, with a renal vein renin ratio (RVRR) of 2.7.\n\n【69】*   4.\n\n【70】    _Which one of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's renal mass, based on his presentation?_\n\n【71】    *   a.\n\n【72】        _Wilms tumor_\n\n【73】    *   b.\n\n【74】        _Renal cell carcinoma_\n\n【75】    *   c.\n\n【76】        _Chronic renal abscess_\n\n【77】    *   d.\n\n【78】        _Metastatic melanoma_\n\n【79】    *   e.\n\n【80】        _Chronic intraparenchymal hematoma_\n\n【81】Since the mass had not been visualized but only inferred from the vascular distortion it caused in the renal parenchyma, the obvious next step is to obtain imaging. The differential diagnosis of a renal mass depends heavily on its radiological appearance. Wilms tumor and renal cell carcinoma are both unlikely, given the patient's age, but both would be distinguished easily on CT. Additionally, because of the patient's overall excellent health, a renal abscess or metastatic melanoma would be highly unlikely. However, considering the patient's history of prior left flank trauma, a chronic intraparenchymal hematoma is the most likely diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging is the best technique for evaluating renal masses since it provides the most accurate information and in this case was the imaging procedure of choice.\n\n【82】Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a subcapsular, calcified hematoma (7.5 × 5.3 cm). Optimal management of the patient's hypertension is the next step.\n\n【83】*   5.\n\n【84】    _Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's hypertension?_\n\n【85】    *   a.\n\n【86】        _Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy_\n\n【87】    *   b.\n\n【88】        _Observation with yearly follow-up_\n\n【89】    *   c.\n\n【90】        _CT-guided aspiration of the hematoma_\n\n【91】    *   d.\n\n【92】        _Surgical decapsulation and resection of the hematoma_\n\n【93】    *   e.\n\n【94】        _Left nephrectomy_\n\n【95】In patients with RAS, an RVRR of 1.5 or more is predictive of a beneficial blood pressure response to either revascularization or nephrectomy.\n\n【96】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【97】Renal-artery stenosis.\n\n【98】In this patient, the RVRR of 2.7 suggests that the hyperreninemic state and hypertension may be improved, and perhaps cured, by correcting the underlying cause. Given the patient's young age, it would be wise to pursue surgical intervention in an attempt to cure hypertension as an alternative to lifelong ACE therapy. Simple observation would be inadequate in the setting of established hypertension likely secondary to kidney trauma and organized hematoma. It is unlikely, given the age and extensive calcification of the hematoma, that needle aspiration could be used successfully to remove the hematoma. It was unclear whether renal decapsulation with resection of the hematoma or total nephrectomy should be conducted. However, because the condition was benign, a surgical strategy designed to spare the left kidney seemed preferable, and our patient underwent decapsulation with resection of the hematoma. Within a week after surgery, his blood pressure level returned to normal, and at 1-year follow-up he remained normotensive without the use of antihypertensive medication.\n\n【99】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【100】Our case is a classic example of direct renal compression by a subcapsular calcified hematoma resulting in systemic hypertension. Intrarenal subcapsular hematoma as a cause of curable hypertension was first described in 1939 by Page\n\n【101】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【102】The production of persistent arterial hypertension by cellophane perinephritis.\n\n【103】and has since been known as Page kidney. Page described a new paradigm for systemic hypertension. After he wrapped cellophane around the kidneys of dogs, cats, and rabbits, hypertension developed within 3 to 5 weeks when a fibrous capsule developed around the wrapped kidneys.\n\n【104】Sixteen years later, Engel and Page\n\n【105】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【106】Hypertension due to renal compression resulting from subcapsular hematoma.\n\n【107】reported the first clinical correlate to Page's pathophysiological model: hypertension developed in a football player after flank trauma occurred and a renal subcapsular hematoma developed. The pathophysiology of hypertension in this model is believed to involve renal ischemia with concurrent hyperreninemia.\n\n【108】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【109】Unilateral “Page kidney” hypertension in man: studies of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system before and after nephrectomy.\n\n【110】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【111】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【112】Hypertension and unilateral renal ischemia (Page kidney) due to compression of a retroperitoneal paraganglioma.\n\n【113】Approximately 80 cases of Page kidney have been described, and preliminary review of the Mayo Clinic experience has yielded 27 cases over the past 35 years.\n\n【114】The main causes of Page kidney are trauma from football and other contact sports, trauma unrelated to sports, motor vehicle accidents, and miscellaneous causes such as tumor, biopsy, renal transplantation, and renal artery dissection.\n\n【115】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【116】Page kidney: case report and review of the literature.\n\n【117】Accepted criteria for diagnosing Page kidney include the presence of hypertension, documentation of renal subcapsular hematoma, and improvement of hypertension with surgical intervention. Although ultrasonography and CT are used more often as diagnostic methods, magnetic resonance imaging was identified recently as a useful tool with excellent resolution. Hypertension should be medically managed, preferably with ACE inhibition, although no clinical trial supports this assumption.\n\n【118】Definitive management of Page kidney is with surgery.\n\n【119】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【120】Capsulectomy: a cure for the Page kidney.\n\n【121】Surgical options include percutaneous or surgical drainage of the hematoma, decapsulation, or subtotal or total nephrectomy.

Curing hypertension can be achieved by using a conservative surgical approach that spares the affected kidney.

This article focuses on ways physicians can develop more useful relationships among these groups. We used a grounded theory approach to conduct 71 interviews from August 12, 2004, to December 27, 2005, with 25 practicing physicians in large and small groups, urban and rural areas, private and academic settings, and primary care and specialty practices; 33 hospital administrators, medical association executives, health insurance medical officers, and health policy analysts; and 13 senior executives of large and small companies. The study identifies 2 approaches to the structuring of ambulatory care that can lead to improved health care outcomes and value. In the first approach, direct contracting between physicians and employers transfers tasks previously performed by insurers to employers or other intermediaries who may be able to provide better service or lower cost. In the second approach, insurermediated relationships between physicians and employers are restructured, particularly in ways that improve information flow. Such relationships may strengthen physicians' ability to provide quality services while enabling patients to make more informed decisions about physician selection, treatments, and spending. We believe that broader use of these approaches may improve the quality and efficiency of ambulatory care for the large proportion of the population that has work-related health insurance.

In an earlier phase,\n\n【97】<sup><a>30</a></sup>\n\n【98】A health care agenda for business.\n\n【99】we focused on how employers can manage employee wellness and health care costs more proactively. In this phase, we have explored the collaborative actions that physicians can take.\n\n【100】METHODS\n-------\n\n【101】Our methods were designed to generate hypotheses about the ways physicians, employers, and insurers can restructure their relationships to improve the delivery of ambulatory care. We used grounded theory, an approach developed in sociological research in which the theory emerges from extensive study of the data and is then illustrated by representative examples of the data.\n\n【102】<sup><a>31</a></sup>\n\n【103】Data management and analysis methods.\n\n【104】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【105】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【106】The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research. Aldine Publishing , Chicago, Ill 1967\n\n【107】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【108】<sup><a>33</a></sup>\n\n【109】Introduction: the discipline and practice of qualitative research.\n\n【110】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【111】<sup><a>34</a></sup>\n\n【112】The interview: from structured questions to negotiated text.\n\n【113】The researcher does not have a preconceived theoretical framework. Rather, the process begins with an open investigation of the problem area. Detailed notes are taken, coded, and analyzed. The new theory emerges as the data are compared with existing theory. The study sample is then expanded to include other examples that may indicate the boundaries of the theory. The data collection-analysis-theory development cycle continues iteratively until further searching nolonger disconfirms the emerging theory. In our case, the approach identified ways health outcomes and value can be improved by replacing the often adversarial relationship among physicians, employers, and insurers with a cooperative relationship.\n\n【114】### Project Design\n\n【115】The study included 71 interviews conducted from August 12, 2004, to December 27, 2005. Our respondents included 25 practicing physicians in large and small groups, urban and rural areas, private and academic settings, and primarycare and specialty practices. Another 33 respondents, two thirds of whom were physicians, included hospital administrators, medical association executives, health insurance medical officers, and health policy analysts. Employer interviews were conducted with 13 senior executives of large and small companies.\n\n【116】### Data Collection and Interpretation\n\n【117】We began by identifying participants (approximately one quarter of the total) who we believed would be knowledgeable about both clinical practice and business and would help us identify novel approaches to collaboration. The rest of the sample was then selected using the snowball sampling method in which interview participants referred us to others, an appropriate technique when the goal is hypothesis generation.\n\n【118】<sup><a>35</a></sup>\n\n【119】Case studies.\n\n【120】We conducted semistructured interviews of participants by telephone. Typically, 2 of the authors (L.L.B. A.M.M.) interviewed each participant for approximately 30 minutes, with one taking detailed notes. Interviewees frequently sent additional information as a follow-up to the interview.\n\n【121】Our first 17 interviews were with clinicians. Interview questions focused on the challenges physicians face in clinical practice and ways business might be able to help. We analyzed the interview transcripts, looking for novel ideas about how physicians could work with business in ways that could improve patient health, system efficiency, and financial performance. We synthesized the emerging themes into a conceptual model of physician partnerships with employers and insurers. We refined the model during a second wave of interviews with 33 respondents, 28 of whom were physicians. Participants identified strengths and weaknesses of the draft model and proposed changes. Finally, we validated the feasibility of the revised model in a series of interviews with 21 business and insurance executives who could potentially partner with clinicians. We continued interviewing participants in each phase of the study until the marginal value of additional interviews was minimal.\n\n【122】RESULTS\n-------\n\n【123】The need for change was frequently and forcefully expressed by many respondents. An infectious disease specialist noted, “The biggest pressure I have as a doctor is to deal with insurance to get paid for what we do. Seeing patients is a piece of cake.” The director of benefits of a medium-sized employer said, “I wouldn't consider us partners with our insurer. Every year we have the battle of premiums and administrative fees. It's not much of a partnership.” \n\n【124】TABLE 2 Illustrative Informant Statements\n\n| **The Need for Change**“There are differing reimbursement rules among insurers. That is an issue. I think it is a nightmare for physicians.”_—Chief medical officer of a health insurer_“The amount of resources we dedicate to getting paid is embarrassing. To the extent that business as the payer can be empathetic may create interesting solutions.”_—Hospital chief executive_“The growing image of health insurers is that they will do everything in their power to deny claims. Employers are fighting costs. Employees are angry with costs. Physicians feel no one appreciates them. It's a dysfunctional family.”_—Chairman of a medium-sized employer_“The only entity that truly cares about health care costs is the employer.”_—Internist_“As the CFO \\[chief financial officer\\] of a privately held company, nothing bothers me more than how I am going to provide health care for my employees for the next 10 years.”_—Chief financial officer of a medium-sized employer_“You will frequently hear physicians rant and rave about those lousy insurance companies and if you then ask them when they last actually sat down with someone from the insurance company to discuss specific issues, concerns, or strategies, their response is frequently, ‘Well, I've never actually done that.’”_—Internist_“Don't trash me, the employer. I, the employer, am not the enemy. I want what you want: healthy people. Why argue with the people who are employing half the population? Why not work with us?”_—Chief medical officer of a large employer_ |\n| --- |\n| **Promise of Direct Contracting Between Physicians and Employers**“I believe solutions to this dilemma of spiraling costs will be found at the community level, not at the federal level.”_—Surgeon and chief medical officer of a multispecialty clinic_“I could get excited about going into a workplace and talking to people about taking responsibility for their own health, how to deal with stress effectively, how to eat better. I see people who have stress issues and complain about their workplace environment.”_—Family physician_“The thing that appeals to me the most is the direct pay model because I think it has a better potential to work. The key is to understand employees and to really identify what they want. The secret to improving their participation is education _and_ incentives. Incentivize employees to do the things that are beneficial to their long-term health. And the employer is in a position to do that.”_—Internist and medical director of a large group practice_“A company just came into our area adding 400 new employees. This is a prime opportunity for a large multispecialty practice to reach out and offer high-risk disease management, safety and injury management with aggressive care of injuries such that employees feel good about the care. This could be packaged as a recruiting tool for workers. For the physician it provides a more stable base income.”_—Registered nurse and hospital system quality improvement executive_“We've studied how you put a complete EMR \\[electronic medical record\\] and decision- support system in a doctor's office. The doctor does the “I” of the ROI \\[return on investment\\] and the payer gets the “R.” EMRs would reduce the amount payers fund by 15%. So why not have employers pay for EMRs in return for gain sharing?”_—Chief information officer of a hospital system_“I like the idea of a direct pay model. My staff could be half the size if we didn't have to work so hard to get reimbursed by insurance companies.”_—Otolaryngologist_“I like getting rid of the middleman. I would love to be able to have the discussion with business to tell them the stupid things we are dealing with.”_—Family physician_“Several of my patients wanted me to be their company physician. One particular patient asked me 3 times before I agreed to look into it. Now \\[as a physician practicing at a company clinic\\], I get dependable reimbursement for my time; convenience and cost-savings for my patients, who are generally more appreciative of my time and services than even the patients at my own practice; and new referrals by the patients into my nursing home and office practice.”_—Family physician with a 1½-day per week direct contracting arrangement_“It breaks my heart that direct contracting is so rare. Couple this with evidence-based care and we could solve this mess. I think the issue is it's time and energy intensive. Most employers tell me they are in the cereal business or the widget business, not the medical business. I say, ‘Of course you're in the medical business. You're spending as much on medical care as you earn in profits.’”_—Physician and chief medical officer of an employer that uses direct contracting_ |\n| **Promise of Insurer-Mediated Relationships Between Physicians and Employers**“Pay physicians to talk to patients. The rise in alternative medicine is because each of its branches involves touching people and connecting with them. If you come back to a high-touch system, you address the critical issues in people's lives such as stress, diet, exercise, smoking and drinking.”_—Physician and chief medical officer of a health insurer_“Your model is our model. We grew our hospital system just to get critical mass with insurers. We got big enough so they can't ignore us. We created a dialogue. We told them what we wanted and asked what they wanted.”_—Physician and chief executive of a rural hospital system and physician group_“Our partnership with the insurer is truly a collaborative effort. We meet weekly. We developed a model to rank things, determine how we’ll get paid and what the pot of money will be. We have set aside to an impressive degree all the old crap.”_—Physician and chief executive of a large oncology practice_“We have learned that if you don't have a relationship and if you don't work collaboratively on projects you lose communication. Administrative hassles and claims are resolved more easily when there is a relationship in place.The whole negotiation goes easier because you start from a place of mutual understanding.”_—Physician and medical director of a health insurer_“Insurance companies don't do a good job of cementing relationships with employers. They could provide meaningful reports—reports showing where the dollars are being spent, benchmarking expenses compared to similar employers, looking at the overall health of a firm's employees, and assessing plan design in terms of the company's objectives.”_—Chief executive officer of an independent physicians' association_“Our members get services from people we don't employ. How do you make sure your customers get excellent service if you don't directly control it? We've concluded that partnering is more effective than hitting people over the head with a stick.”_—Physician and vice-president of a health insurer_“We recognize that medicine in the future will require us to measure performance and improve on it, rather than say we do a pretty good job and leave it there.”_—Physician and associate medical director of a large multispecialty practice_ |\n| **Words of Caution**“Change happens when the pain of the status quo exceeds the perceived pain of change and we're not at that point yet. Health plans are doing well.”_—Manager of health care programming for a large employer_“In talking to employers, I've found that, while they may be in pain, it is very difficult to get them to do anything around health care other than tweaking the co-pay. The CEO \\[chief executive officer\\] may send you to the VP \\[vice president\\] of human resources who tends not to be a change agent. It's difficult to find the right people to listen.”_—Internist interested in doing direct contracting_“For direct contracting, you need a special company with a special vision, a company that has run out of other options.”_—Principal of an employee benefits consulting firm specializing in direct contracting_“One of the great dilemmas we have is that people want unlimited access. In the direct pay model, you will highly limit choice. I don't think patients are going to buy it. Physicians will like the steady income stream from a long-term contract with an employer. It will simplify their lives. What's in it for the employee? Financial incentives? A vetted physician group?”_—Physician and chief medical officer of a health insurer_“I'm still leery of whether the direct model can work. You need to have the right doctors in the direct network. People are constantly disappointed to go through HMO \\[health maintenance organization\\] and PPO \\[preferred provider organization\\] lists and find that their doctors are not on the list of providers.”_—Owner of a medium-sized employer_“Companies considering direct contracting need to have a 3-year time horizon. The significant savings come in years 2 and 3. The focus on prevention often does not show a material return for 2 years.”_—Principal of consulting firm that develops direct contracting relationships_“The physician needs to have enough of the business's employees in the patient group to justify the internal administrative hurdles involved in setting up a payment system to a captive medical group.”_—Physician and corporate medical director of a large employer_“Adoption of EHR \\[electronic health record\\] and decision-support tools—the whole IT \\[information technology\\] piece— shouldn't be another prong in a multiprong paradigm, but should really be the central part of the model, the unifying part. IT is the cohesive bond. If that's not fixed it's silly to talk about these models.”_—Physician and senior executive of a health insurer_ |\n\n【126】Two broad opportunities for physicians to establish more productive partnerships emerged from the data . The first is for physicians to bypass insurers and contract directly with employers to provide health care services to employees and dependents. The second is for physicians to establish more productive and extensive relationships with insurers that, in turn, can strengthen insurers' relationships with employers.\n\n【127】### Direct Contracting Between Physicians and Employers\n\n【128】Direct contracting is a promising model for improved physician-employer relationships . The medical director of a large employer that uses direct contracting said, “Medical groups loved the idea of direct contracting with us. No one turned us down. They had never before had a chance to talk to employers. The chance to work directly with an employer was appealing. We had them over and described where we were trying to go. We asked them to participate when we developed guidelines. We sent our drafts over for comment. We went out of our way to pay promptly.”\n\n【129】FIGURE 2 Direct contracting relationship between physician and employer. EHR = electronic health record.\n\n【130】In a direct contracting relationship, the physician collaborates with an employer to provide health services to employees and dependents, either on company premises or at the physician's office. We found that large medical groups, small groups, and solo practitioners were participating in direct contracting relationships. Employers appeared to favor physicians with board certification, an uncluttered history of malpractice litigation and complaints, and the ability to build interpersonal relationships with patients. Participating employers are typically self-insured firms with more than 200 employees, rather than smaller firms that purchase health coverage through an insurer.\n\n【131】Direct contracting relationships often consist initially of agreements between employers and primary care physicians; specialist relationships may be added later. Compensation is typically fee for service, and employers commit to prompt reimbursement. Physicians usually work with the employer's medical director to establish clinical guidelines and patient satisfaction goals. Agreements typically stipulate that the physician is responsible for directing care and provide for noninterference by the employer. Figure 2 lists common responsibilities of employees and physicians.\n\n【132】Employees and their dependents typically have a financial incentive to use company-contracted physicians but have the flexibility to seek care elsewhere. In some firms, employees choose on a visit-by-visit basis; in others, employees choose annually among health plans, with one option being lower-cost company-contracted physicians.\n\n【133】Direct contracting relationships have been initiated by physicians and by employers. Occasionally, the employer's human resources staff directly negotiates the contracts. Frequently, intermediaries facilitate the administrative contacts between the physician and employer, performing functions traditionally handled by insurers. For example, anintermediary may develop the physician network by negotiating terms with participating physicians. Other intermediaries may administer benefits and claims and review utilization. These intermediaries do not assume risk or interpose clinical or fiscal policies. They are strictly administrative, which makes them fundamentally different from insurers.\n\n【134】The experience of Perdue Farms and physicians in rural Maryland and nearby states is illustrative. Perdue established direct contracting relationships with health care professionals in small and large practices to provide onsite and offsite care for Perdue's 45,000 employees and dependents. Perdue built onsite primary and specialty care clinics at its chicken processing plants. Employees and dependents receive longitudinal care for acute and chronic disease as well as preventive services. Employees are charged $10 per visit, payable through payroll deduction. Employees complete health risk appraisals and receive personalized plans for health. Contracted physicians are supported by a single clinical laboratory. Primary care often assumes a central role in direct contracting, which is the case at Perdue. Since Perdue began contracting with physicians, primary care has increased from 6% of Perdue's physician spending to 30%. At their discretion, primary care physicians provide referrals to specialists.\n\n【135】Perdue reports an average annual health care inflation rate of 0.7% for 2002 to 2005, well below national trends.\n\n【136】<sup><a>36</a></sup>\n\n【137】*   Kaiser Family Foundation Health Research and Educational Trust\n\n【138】Employer Health Benefits 2006 Annual Survey.\n\n【139】Health care costs per employee, including costs of administering the plan, are approximately half the national average. Perdue attributes the savings to the direct contracting relationships that emphasize prevention and appropriate treatment of chronic conditions and reduce emergency department visits for employees with minor illnesses. Also, the onsite clinics are structured to encourage the use of evidence-based medicine and generic drugs.\n\n【140】Two of the programs we studied, the Perdue Farms direct contracting program and a similar program at Quad Graphics in Wisconsin, are fairly elaborate, but we also uncovered simpler direct contracting models. CareHere, a company in Nashville, Tenn, connects physicians with smaller employers who want to establish onsite primary care clinics at worksites with 100 or more employees. CareHere recruits physicians from the employer's health plan network, preferring physicians already popular with employees. Physicians we interviewed emphasized the dependable reimbursement, reduced administrative burden, and opportunity for referrals to their office practices. They perceived themselves as patient coaches rather than distrusted gatekeepers.\n\n【141】<sup><a>37</a></sup>\n\n【142】The Rise and Fall of HMOs: An American Health Care Revolution. University of Wisconsin Press , Madison, Wis 2004\n\n【143】A board-certified family physician described his weekly 12 hours in an onsite clinic for county employees as, “A chance to get back to what medicine is all about. I spend my time taking care of patients—not filling out paperwork.” Employers in the CareHere system are experiencing health care cost trends of 3%, approximately a third of national averages.\n\n【144】<sup><a>36</a></sup>\n\n【145】*   Kaiser Family Foundation Health Research and Educational Trust\n\n【146】Employer Health Benefits 2006 Annual Survey.\n\n【147】Drug costs are typically 7.5% lower in the first year and 15% lower in the second year of the direct contracting relationship.\n\n【148】### Insurer-Mediated Relationships Between Physicians and Employers\n\n【149】In this model, insurers shift their missions from minimizing claims costs to improving health care value . The insurer-mediated model reassesses 2 sets of relationships: those between employers and insurers\n\n【150】<sup><a>30</a></sup>\n\n【151】A health care agenda for business.\n\n【152】and those between physicians and insurers, which we focus on herein. Our informants told us that participants in a fully evolved physician-insurer relationship will need to undertake most of the actions described on the left side of Figure 3 .\n\n【153】FIGURE 3 Insurer-mediated relationships between physicians and employers. EHR = electronic health record.\n\n【154】During our investigations, we found examples in which physicians and insurers were able to improve quality and finances through collaboration. To illustrate, Premera Blue Cross in Washington State asked physicians to codevelop a quality scorecard, rather than imposing a reporting system. The initiative, which covered 13 clinics and 300,000 members in 2005, began in 2001 when Premera invited 6 large multispecialty medical groups to identify key quality and satisfaction indicators. A clinic medical director observed, “Premera was smart to let us build the scorecard. We can't use the ‘they did this to us’ excuse. And we set the bar higher than Premera might have.” Contracts with some participating clinics are structured to provide financial rewards for improvements in performance over prior year results.\n\n【155】Such efforts were associated with documented improvement in the delivery of recommended care, particularly for low-scoring measures. For example, early results show substantial improvement among the 1200 diabetic patients with Premera health coverage seen at participating clinics: from 2003 to 2004, hemoglobin A <sub>1c </sub> level of less than 7% improved from 27.4% to 51.3% of patients; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 100 mg/dL improved from 26.7% to 41.6% of patients; and systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg improved from 25.9% to 38.6% of patients.\n\n【156】<sup><a>38</a></sup>\n\n【157】*   Premera Blue Cross\n\n【158】Premera Quality Score Card.\n\n【159】The scorecard also gives physicians an early warning of undesired trends. For example, appropriate use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis, another low-scoring measure, improved 37.7% in 2003 and then declined 10.5% in 2004. Participating medical groups and Premera discussed reasons for the retrenchment (some physicians noted that the decline paralleled reduced media attention to the appropriate use of antibiotics\n\n【160】<sup><a>39</a></sup>\n\n【161】Demand for anthrax drug ebbs; use of powerful Cipro in state tapers off, study says.\n\n【162】) and were then able to pay greater attention to appropriate practices. Premera is also developing desktop tools that allow physicians to see their monthly performance along with a list of their patients who are not receiving recommended care or not filling prescriptions, which enables physicians to follow up.\n\n【163】Insurers can facilitate cooperation among medical groups. A physician participating in Premera's quality scorecard program commented, “Doctors are competitive. If another clinic can do well at making sure congestive heart patients are on ACE \\[angiotensin-converting enzyme\\] inhibitors, then we can, too. There's an overwhelming willingness among the clinics to share their expertise so we can all get better.” Cancer Care Northwest, an inte-grated multispecialty oncology practice in Spokane, Wash, created a program with Premera designed to improve quality, reduce waste, and improve practice finances by adopting evidence-based clinical pathways. It is now measuring adherence to the pathways, for example, tracking the percentage of breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node sampling or appropriate axillary dissections. With Premera's encouragement, Cancer Care Northwest reached out to other local medical groups, and Spokane-area pulmonologists, surgeons, and medical and radiation oncologists are working together to develop joint clinical pathways for evaluating and treating lung cancer. The oncology group's chief executive observed, “I've been interested in quality for years but I didn't have the infrastructure or the time. In the ideal world, we should just do it, but in the real world, we needed a partner who could structure payment programs to provide appropriate incentives.”\n\n【164】Insurer-physician collaborations require an appreciation of the strengths and limitations of each partner. Premera tailored a quality recognition program for small office practices, which typically lack the computer and staff infrastructure for quality reporting. The insurer reviews claims histories to recognize physicians who consistently follow national guidelines in, for example, cancer screenings or appropriate use of antibiotics.\n\n【165】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【166】Using business parlance, physicians, health insurers, and employers form the core of a distribution channel, defined as the set of interdependent organizations involved in the process of making a good or service available to the end user. However, when distribution channel relationships are dysfunctional, inefficiencies develop, and dissatisfaction is more likely.\n\n【167】<sup><a>40</a></sup>\n\n【168】Marketing Channels. 6th ed. Prentice Hall , Upper Saddle River, NJ 2001\n\n【169】In health care, abundant evidence has shown that the current distribution channel does not operate optimally. Patients report difficulty in obtaining access to care and to physician-level quality and price information. Physicians complain that claims processing, referrals, and authorizations are overly burdensome. Employers believe costs are too high, and physicians believe reimbursements are too low.\n\n【170】From our interview data, we developed a conceptual model  with 2 approaches for improving the delivery of outpatient medical care: direct contracting between physicians and employers  and restructured relationships between insurers and employers and between insurers and physicians . Our model should be considered a prospective model that conveys what could be. Although both approaches are now being used successfully, they have yet to spread widely. Measuring the extent and sustainability of their potential benefits requires more time and much more research. We hope that presenting these ideas at this early stage will stimulate that research while encouraging physicians, employers, and insurers who are dissatisfied with the status quo to consider these options.\n\n【171】Our findings suggest that direct contracting between physicians and employers has the potential to offer more appropriate reimbursement to physicians, reimbursement that rewards adherence to evidence-based medicine and quality results and ultimately may lead to less costly health care. Participants cited improved access to primary care, more consistent care for chronic diseases, an emphasis on preventive health and early detection of disease, and lower unnecessary emergency department use among the salient benefits of direct contracting. The assessment is consistent with the emerging literature that associates improved access to primary care with reduced illness and disease, rationalized access to specialty care, reduced socioeconomic and geographic disparity, reduced emergency department use, and lower costs.\n\n【172】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【173】Effect of managed care and financing on practice constraints and career satisfaction in primary care.\n\n【174】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【175】<sup><a>41</a></sup>\n\n【176】Contribution of primary care to health systems and health.\n\n【177】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【178】<sup><a>42</a></sup>\n\n【179】The essential role of generalists in health care systems.\n\n【180】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【181】<sup><a>43</a></sup>\n\n【182】Provider continuity in family medicine: does it make a difference for total health care costs?\n\n【183】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【184】<sup><a>44</a></sup>\n\n【185】Primary care: the next renaissance.\n\n【186】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【187】<sup><a>45</a></sup>\n\n【188】Medicare spending, the physician workforce, and beneficiaries' quality of care.\n\n【189】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【190】<sup><a>46</a></sup>\n\n【191】Geographic variation in expenditures for physicians' services in the United States.\n\n【192】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【193】<sup><a>47</a></sup>\n\n【194】Are primary care services a substitute or complement for specialty and inpatient services?\n\n【195】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【196】<sup><a>48</a></sup>\n\n【197】Is gatekeeping better than traditional care? a survey of physicians' attitudes.\n\n【198】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【199】<sup><a>49</a></sup>\n\n【200】Resolving the gatekeeper conundrum: what patients value in primary care and referrals to specialists.\n\n【201】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【202】<sup><a>50</a></sup>\n\n【203】What accounts for differences in the use of hospital emergency departments across U.S. communities?\n\n【204】Direct contracting participants also suggested practice innovation may be sparked by the opportunity for physicians and employers to communicate directly. Physicians may be able to reduce staff expenses for billing and collection.\n\n【205】The direct contracting model best fits self-insured employers with 200 or more employees who assume the financial risk of health care costs and use third-party administrators to process benefits and claims. Approximately 50% of all US employees are enrolled in self-insured companies' plans.\n\n【206】<sup><a>51</a></sup>\n\n【207】Self-insurance in times of growing and retreating managed care.\n\n【208】Because these employers retain financial responsibility for health care costs, there is no need to carve out the direct contracting relationship for actuarial calculations. The concept holds less financial appeal for smaller, fully insured employers, who would absorb the cost of direct contracting services in addition to health insurance premiums.\n\n【209】Direct contracting should work best in organizations that have earned the trust of employees. Employees need assurance of a firewall between the physician and the company's operating management, given the highly personal nature of health care and the potential for divided loyalties of physicians who work directly for their employer. Indeed, some staff physicians hired by large companies to offer onsite medical care and manage workers' compensation programs report pressure to minimize corporate expenses rather than provide high-quality care.\n\n【210】<sup><a>52</a></sup>\n\n【211】The Company Doctor: Risk, Responsibility, and Corporate Professionalism.

Nonetheless, because the potential for divided loyalties exists, we favor direct contracting models in which patients retain the choice between company-contracted physicians and other physicians.\n\n【219】Although the direct contracting model is promising in certain situations, we believe insurers will continue to mediate most relationships between physicians and employers. Insurers underwrite risk, a critical requirement of smaller employers. Moreover, many employers and physicians will be reluctant to invest the time required to establish direct contracting relationships. In addition, some employees may prefer access to noncontracted physicians or need such access when they require highly specialized care or are traveling.\n\n【220】Our findings suggest that the health care system will be better served by physician-insurer interactions characterized by open communications and cooperation, thus facilitating the pooling of resources to better understand and care for patients. Although insurers will continue to manage risk, they can add value by focusing less on managing costs and more on managing information in ways that help physicians, patients, and employers make better decisions about care. Insurers can help employers reward innovative physicians who achieve superior clinical outcomes, adopt proven medical practices, and satisfy patients. We believe the distrust that physicians, employers, and patients harbor for insurers\n\n【221】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【222】Aetna agreement with doctors envisions altered managed care.\n\n【223】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【224】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【225】WellPoint settles doctors' lawsuit.\n\n【226】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【227】<sup><a>55</a></sup>\n\n【228】The cost of health insurance administration in California: estimates for insurers, physicians, and hospitals.\n\n【229】could help motivate these changes.

This finding further suggests to us the value of physicians reaching out to insurers.\n\n【233】Our study has several limitations. One is the relatively small number of informants. The hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing study purpose mitigates this limitation to a degree. Moreover, we continued interviewing participants in each phase of the study until the marginal value of additional interviews was minimal. Another limitation is that the resulting models do not encompass the large number of patients without employer-sponsored health insurance. With employer-sponsored health insurance covering only 63% of the population,\n\n【234】<sup><a>56</a></sup>\n\n【235】Sources of Health Insurance and Characteristics of the Uninsured: Analysis of the March 2004 Current Population Survey.

Most importantly, our study's research design can identify interesting and promising ideas, but it cannot provide the information needed to decide with confidence the generalizability or the sustained merit of the ideas.\n\n【237】Third-party payers, driven largely by commercial and political pressures, are so deeply entrenched in the US health care system that their role in the current dysfunctional delivery system seems somehow natural or inevitable. However, the results of this study suggest that it is possible to shift the relationships among physicians, insurers, and employers to create a more efficient and effective ambulatory care delivery system . Physicians, especially those in smaller practices and in primary care, generally have less bargaining power than insurers or large employers in the current system.\n\n【238】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【239】Maximizing reimbursement by appealing claim denials.\n\n【240】The 2 approaches discussed in this article can help elevate physicians' relative influence. A 2-physician practice that takes care of numerous employees in an organization will certainly have influence with that employer. Physicians who can document superior health outcomes and reduced waste have a better opportunity to influence an insurer. Table 4 indicates some initial steps physicians can take to develop these relationships. An argument can even be made that physicians are uniquely equipped to catalyze the development of better medical care delivery systems. As one of our respondents stated, Physicians must lead change in health care. They better understand the health care system and better understand what constitutes value. They are better able to lead other physicians. They understand patients' needs. And they understand physicians' fiduciary responsibility to patients as well as responsibility to the population. Ultimately, this is all about changing culture and physicians can best do that.\n\n【241】TABLE 3 Uncommon Scenario: Physicians, Insurers, and Employers as Partners\n\n| **Physicians, insurers, and employers engaged in progressive partnerships will be more likely to adopt goals and behaviors related to the larger goals of improved health care outcomes and efficiency …** | **Physicians, insurers, and employers engaged in progressive partnerships will be more likely to adopt goals and behaviors related to the larger goals of improved health care outcomes and efficiency …** | **Physicians, insurers, and employers engaged in progressive partnerships will be more likely to adopt goals and behaviors related to the larger goals of improved health care outcomes and efficiency …** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Physicians will tend to push to** | **Insurers will tend to push to** | **Employers will tend to push to** |\n| Provide evidence-based careImprove practice productivityEarn an attractive compensation | Improve the health of the entire insured groupAssure quality of services paid forMinimize inappropriate claims payoutsAchieve an attractive profit | Observe improved efficiency, effectiveness, and safety of health care services for employees and dependentsStabilize health care cost increases |\n| **The partners align incentives to encourage coordinated strategies …** | **The partners align incentives to encourage coordinated strategies …** | **The partners align incentives to encourage coordinated strategies …** |\n| **Physicians are more likely to**Invest in electronic health recordsInvest in evidence-based decision-support systemsBe transparent with outcomes and cost informationInvest more in patient education and counselingOffer extended hours and nonvisit access | **Insurers are more likely to**Track physician performance initially measuring adherence to preferred processes and eventually measuring outcomesRecognize high-performing physicians with meaningful, timely rewardsDisseminate physician outcome and cost information to employers and patientsCoach patients who are evaluating treatment alternatives | **Employers are more likely to**Encourage and educate employees to make thoughtful health care decisionsOffer personal health assessments and identify appropriate interventionsIntegrate wellness into the company cultureEmphasize preventionDemand and reward quality from health care physicians |\n| **As a result, the health care system is strengthened and channel members are rewarded for strong performance …** | **As a result, the health care system is strengthened and channel members are rewarded for strong performance …** | **As a result, the health care system is strengthened and channel members are rewarded for strong performance …** |\n| **Physicians are more likely to achieve**Safer, more effective, patient-centered care delivered in a timely, efficient, and equitable manner | **Insurers are more likely to achieve**Better decision making by patientsContinuous improvement among physiciansImproved reputations | **Employers are more likely to achieve**Reduced incidence of lifestyle diseasesReduced regional variation in careImproved employee productivity and job satisfaction |\n\n【243】TABLE 4 Getting Started in Building Partnerships With Insurers and Employers\n\n| **All relationships start with communication.

He had been well until 3 months previously when he developed left testicular pain with fever and vomiting. Two to 3 days later the fever had subsided, but he experienced severe pelvic pain, described as deep, poorly localized, and worse with weight bearing and hip abduction. Treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and other analgesics provided little benefit. He denied having persistent fever, anorexia, or weight loss. There were no changes in bowel pattern and no hematochezia, hematuria, or worsening of the pain with micturition or bowel movements. Aside from the pelvic pain, findings on review of systems were normal.\n\n【1】The patient's medical history was unremarkable except for hyperlipidemia. Physical examination revealed only tenderness over the symphysis pubis. He had normal passive range of motion of his hips but had tenderness on abduction bilaterally. Slight edema of his left lower extremity was evident.\n\n【2】An extensive evaluation before referral showed an elevated sedimentation rate (ESR) of 104/mm in 1 h (reference ranges shown parenthetically) (<10 mm/1 h), elevated IgG of 2680 mg/dL (700–1500 mg/dL), and normal IgM and IgA. Presence of a small monoclonal spike was suspected within a broad polyclonal band. A metastatic bone scan showed no lytic or sclerotic lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his pelvis, performed to evaluate pelvic pain, showed only a slightly abnormal marrow signal. The possibility of multiple myeloma was raised, and he was referred for further work-up.\n\n【3】*   1.\n\n【4】    **_Which one of the following tests would be least helpful in confirming the diagnosis suspected in this patient?_**\n\n【5】    *   a.\n\n【6】        _Bone marrow examination_\n\n【7】    *   b.\n\n【8】        _Plasma cell labeling index (PCLI)_\n\n【9】    *   c.\n\n【10】        _Metastatic skeletal scan_\n\n【11】    *   d.\n\n【12】        _Serum and urinary protein electrophoresis_\n\n【13】    *   e.\n\n【14】        _Marrow cytogenetics_\n\n【15】The conspicuous feature of this patient's presentation is the poorly localized pelvic pain. Patients with multiple myeloma often present with bone pain. Fever and testicular pain are unusual presenting symptoms for multiple myeloma, although such patients are at a higher risk for infections. Multiple myeloma is typically accompanied by (1) an increase in plasma cells in the bone marrow, (2) lytic bone lesions on radiographs, and (3) serum and/or urinary monoclonal immunoglobulins (M component).\n\n【16】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【17】Multiple myeloma, macroglobulinemia and monoclonal gammopathies.\n\n【18】A minimum of 10% to 15% of plasma cells seen at bone marrow biopsy has traditionally been considered necessary for diagnosing multiple myeloma. However, in a recent large series of patients with confirmed multiple myeloma, 14% had less than 10% plasma cells in the marrow.\n\n【19】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【20】Morphology of multiple myeloma.\n\n【21】The plasma cell in multiple myeloma often shows features of immaturity. The PCLI is a measure of the proliferative activity of plasma cells and is expressed as the fraction in S phase, indicated by the capacity of cells to incorporate a DNA precursor like tritiated thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine. Because the PCLI can confirm the clonality of marrow plasma cells, it is useful not only diagnostically but also prognostically.\n\n【22】Plain radiographs, as used in metastatic skeletal scans, reveal bony abnormalities consisting of punched out lytic lesions, osteoporosis, or fractures in about 75% of patients. These abnormalities are usually multiple and are most commonly seen in the skull, ribs, sternum, spine, or proximal long bones. Radionuclide imaging of the bone is less useful in multiple myeloma since it tends to detect areas of new bone formation, which is typically absent in myeloma bone lesions. Computed tomography (CT) and MRI are often helpful in demonstrating vertebral lesions not seen on plain films. In about 0.5% to 3% of patients, osteosclerotic lesions predominate, and this is frequently associated with POEMS syndrome ( _p_ olyneuropathy, _o_ rganomegaly, _e_ ndocrinopathy, _M_ protein, and _s_ kin changes).\n\n【23】Serum protein electrophoresis may reveal an M protein. The M protein represents the monoclonal immunoglobulin overproduced by the clonal population of plasma cells. A serum M protein of more than 3.0 g/dL has been used as a diagnostic requirement for multiple myeloma, but a clear delineation of values is sometimes difficult. In about 1% of patients with multiple myeloma, the serum or urine M protein cannot be detected (“nonsecretors”). IgG is the most common type of M protein (50%-60%), followed by IgA (19%-22%) and IgD (1%-2%); only light chains are seen in 17% to 25% of patients. Urinary light chains are detected in about 80% of patients, including some in whom no serum M spike is seen, stressing the importance of performing both serum and urine protein electrophoresis. Various cytogenetic abnormalities have been described in multiple myeloma but are not required for the diagnosis.\n\n【24】Our patient had no evidence of lytic or sclerotic lesions on his metastatic bone scan. A bone marrow biopsy revealed 5% plasma cells, which appeared normal. Serum electrophoresis revealed a polyclonal IgG band but no monoclonal spike, and findings on urinary electrophoresis were normal. The PCLI was 0%.\n\n【25】*   2.\n\n【26】    **_Which one of the following tests would be least useful for further evaluation of this patient's pelvic pain?_**\n\n【27】    *   a.\n\n【28】        _Plain radiograph of the pelvis including hip joints_\n\n【29】    *   b.\n\n【30】        _CT of the pelvis_\n\n【31】    *   c.\n\n【32】        _MRI of the lumbosacral spine and pelvis_\n\n【33】    *   d.\n\n【34】        _Colonoscopy_\n\n【35】    *   e.\n\n【36】        _Pelvic ultrasonography_\n\n【37】The pattern of pain in our patient is highly suggestive of a musculoskeletal origin, and this dictates our diagnostic approach. Plain radiographs of the pelvis are relatively inexpensive, and they provide valuable information regarding fractures and destructive lesions involving bones and joints as well as other conditions involving the hip joint, like avascular necrosis of the femoral head and degenerative joint disease. Changes seen on a plain film also could raise suspicion of infections and bony tumors. Pelvis CT can help to evaluate the bony structures and visualize adjacent soft tissue. It also has the added advantage of visualizing the visceral organs. In the setting of bone infections, MRI is useful and often helps to identify bone marrow pathology. In the evaluation of bony abnormalities in this patient, MRI of the lumbosacral spine and pelvis might be useful, although radiculopathy seems unlikely. Colonoscopy, a valuable tool in the evaluation of bowel symptoms, is unlikely to be useful because our patient has no bowel symptoms. Ultrasonography provides valuable information on visceral organs and would be helpful in the evaluation of pain originating from these structures.\n\n【38】The plain films of the hip showed separation of the symphysis pubis and slight bony irregularity of the bony borders. Computed tomography confirmed the separation but showed no additional findings. A bone scan revealed slightly increased uptake over the symphysis. Osteomyelitis involving the pubic symphysis was suspected.\n\n【39】*   3.\n\n【40】    **_Which one of the following conditions has a clinical presentation that closely mimics the suspected diagnosis (and may be an alternative diagnosis) in this patient?_**\n\n【41】    *   a.\n\n【42】        _Pelvic fracture_\n\n【43】    *   b.\n\n【44】        _Osteitis pubis_\n\n【45】    *   c.\n\n【46】        _Bony malignancies_\n\n【47】    *   d.\n\n【48】        _Radiation necrosis_\n\n【49】    *   e.\n\n【50】        _Cystitis_\n\n【51】Our patient gave no history of trauma, and a fracture is unlikely in the absence of trauma. Stress fracture in the absence of trauma is more likely in the presence of severe osteoporosis. Osteitis pubis is a painful noninfectious, inflammatory condition involving the pubic bone, symphysis, and surrounding structures that closely mimics pubic osteomyelitis in clinical presentation.\n\n【52】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【53】Periostitis of symphysis and descending rami of pubes following suprapubic operations.\n\n【54】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【55】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【56】Osteitis pubis: a diagnosis for the family physician.\n\n【57】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【58】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【59】Osteitis pubis: a review.\n\n【60】It often follows pregnancy, direct trauma, athletic exertion, urologic manipulation, and urologic and gynecological surgery, all of which can predispose to pubic osteomyelitis. The white blood cell count (WBC) and ESR may be elevated, and radiological changes similar to osteomyelitis can be seen. Radiographic changes include symmetrical bone resorption at the medial ends of the pubic bones, widening of the pubic symphysis, and rarefaction or sclerosis along the pubic rami. Bone scans can show diffuse uptake in the symphysis even before plain films reveal abnormal findings. The cause of osteitis pubis is unclear, but some experts have suggested that it is analogous to sympathetic dystrophy. Bony tumors are more likely to present with radiologically visualized growths and are unlikely to be mistaken for osteomyelitis. Radiation necrosis can often mimic osteomyelitis, but our patient reported no history of previous radiation therapy. Cystitis can produce pelvic pain but does not cause radiological abnormalities.\n\n【61】*   4.\n\n【62】    **_Which one of the following procedures would be most informative for confirming the suspected diagnosis in this patient?_**\n\n【63】    *   a.\n\n【64】        _Plain radiographs_\n\n【65】    *   b.\n\n【66】        _Bone scan_\n\n【67】    *   c.\n\n【68】        _CT_\n\n【69】    *   d.\n\n【70】        _MRI_\n\n【71】    *   e.\n\n【72】        _Needle aspiration and culture_\n\n【73】Several imaging modalities are available for the evaluation of bone and joint infection.\n\n【74】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【75】Osteomyelitis: a review of currently used imaging techniques.\n\n【76】The results of these studies depend on the site and chronicity of infection, degree of inflammation, presence of foreign bodies, vascularity, contiguous vs hematogenous, etc, and the type of comorbidities present, such as neuropathic osteopathy in a patient with neuropathy. None of these modalities can confirm or rule out osteomyelitis with certainty, and findings should be interpreted in the clinical context. The initial study should include plain radiographs of the specific bone. Changes due to infection usually take 1 to 2 weeks to become obvious on a plain radiograph and include cortical destruction, periosteal elevation, and new bone formation. Radionuclide imaging exploits the increased osteoblastic activity at sites of infection and the increased vascularity induced by inflammation. The most commonly used radio-nuclide imaging is the technetium Tc 99m bone scan. Triple phase bone scans use delayed images to separate soft tissue inflammation, which shows early uptake, from bony involvement with persistent uptake. However, these scans are less specific and should be used in conjunction with another radionuclide study like indium-labeled WBC scintigraphy. Bone scans are more sensitive compared to plain films, and they can rule out osteomyelitis with an accuracy of more than 90%. Since radionuclide studies depend on adequate regional blood flow, they may be less helpful in the setting of compromised perfusion. Indium-labeled WBC scintigraphy is more specific for infection but is much less sensitive. Gallium citrate Ga 67 has also been used in the diagnosis of bone infections but is less specific than technetium-labeled scans. Computed tomography is especially useful in the evaluation of the spine, pelvis, and sternum. Early findings on CT include intramedullary gas or increased marrow density. Other changes like sclerosis, demineralization, periosteal reaction, and sequestra are often seen with chronic osteomyelitis. In the evaluation of musculoskeletal pathology, MRI has certain advantages. Marrow abnormalities on MRI appear earlier in the course of disease than lytic changes seen radiographically. Active osteomyelitis shows a low signal on T1-weighted images and a high signal on T2-weighted images, representing increased marrow water due to edema, exudate, and hyperemia. Compared with CT, MRI provides better resolution of abscesses and soft tissue processes and is the modality of choice for suspected spinal infection. The overall sensitivity of MRI has ranged from 92% to 100% in different studies, with specificity between 89% and 100%; however, the image quality can be substantially degraded by orthopedic hardware. The “gold standard” for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis remains microbiologic and histopathologic examinations of the bone. Blood cultures may be of value in acute cases and are positive in about one third of the cases of hematogenous osteomyelitis in children and in 25% of adults. Needle aspiration or needle biopsies of the involved bones and joints usually provide enough material for definitive microbiologic diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein and ESR are elevated in more than 90% of patients with acute osteomyelitis, and C-reactive protein in particular normalizes rapidly after successful treatment and can be used to monitor response.\n\n【77】A needle aspirate was obtained from the pubic symphysis under CT guidance, and cultures from the aspirate were positive for group A ×-hemolytic streptococci. Acid-fast stains were negative, and mycobacterial and anaerobic cultures remained negative on prolonged incubation.\n\n【78】*   5.\n\n【79】    **_Which one of the following is the next most appropriate step in the management of this patient?_**\n\n【80】    *   a.\n\n【81】        _Parenteral antibiotics_\n\n【82】    *   b.\n\n【83】        _Oral antibiotics_\n\n【84】    *   c.\n\n【85】        _Antibiotic-impregnated polymethylmethacrylate beads_\n\n【86】    *   d.\n\n【87】        _Surgery and débridement_\n\n【88】    *   e.\n\n【89】        _Observation_\n\n【90】Antibiotic therapy guided by in vitro susceptibility studies performed on culture remains the cornerstone of therapy and should be administered parenterally, at least initially. Oral antibiotics can be substituted later in the course of treatment. Empirical antibiotic therapy should be avoided unless a microbiologic diagnosis cannot be established. Local instillation of antibiotics is an attractive option in certain selected clinical situations, and various methods have been tried, including closed suction-irrigation and antibiotic-impregnated beads. Presence of sequestra and of foreign body or prosthesis often requires surgery and débridement for cure, as does failure of medical therapy. Patients with osteomyelitis should be carefully followed up, and clinical improvement remains the best measure of response. Osteitis pubis, as mentioned earlier, is often a self-limiting inflammatory condition of the pubic symphysis and can be managed expectantly. However, once an infectious cause is confirmed, observation alone is not a choice, and antimicrobial therapy must be instituted.\n\n【91】Although penicillin G has traditionally been considered the antimicrobial agent of choice for the treatment of serious infections due to ×-hemolytic streptococci, once-daily ceftriaxone is a convenient, practical, and attractive choice for outpatient administration. Thus, our patient was given once-daily intramuscular ceftriaxone for 6 weeks, during which he gradually improved. At 1-year follow-up, he was doing well and had no symptoms. His ESR and immunoglobulins had returned to normal.\n\n【92】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【93】Osteomyelitis of the symphysis pubis occurs infrequently, constituting less than 1% of hematogenous osteomyelitis\n\n【94】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【95】Hematogenous osteomyelitis: a changing disease.\n\n【96】and less than 10% of infections involving pelvic bones.

It has also been reported after other procedures, like inguinal hernia repair, cardiac catheterization, renal transplantation, and suprapubic catheterization, and after trauma in athletes. Radiation therapy to the pelvis has been associated with onset of pubic osteomyelitis years later. More recently, osteomyelitis of the pubic symphysis has been noted with increasing frequency in intravenous drug users. In some patients, such as our patient, no predisposing factor is identified, even after a thorough search.\n\n【103】Several hypotheses have been suggested to explain the pathogenesis of this unusual infection. In vesicourethral suspension procedures, the bladder neck and urethra are often sutured directly to the ligaments overlying the symphysis pubis, allowing direct spread of infection from the urinary stream. Hematogenous spread has also been incriminated in the cause of pubic osteomyelitis, and our patient most likely had a transient bacteremia leading to eventual osteomyelitis. Hematogenous osteomyelitis is seen more often in children and involving the metaphyseal ends of long bones; however, the pubic symphysis has been described as a metaphyseal equivalent. Metaphyseal ends are defined as portions of flat and irregular bones adjacent to cartilage. The metaphyseal type of vascular anatomy with large sinusoids and sluggish flow predisposes them to hematogenous seeding. The most commonly encountered organisms are _Pseudomonas_ (especially in intravenous drug users), staphylococci, and Enterobacteriaceae.

Patients frequently have a waddling gait attributed to adductor and rectus abdominis muscle spasm. A painful hip can be the sole presenting symptom in children. Findings on physical examination often reveal point tenderness over the pubic symphysis but can also be normal.\n\n【110】Laboratory investigations usually demonstrate an elevated ESR and WBC. Plain films of the pelvis may show the typical changes of irregular bony borders, rarefaction, superficial bony destruction, and symphyseal widening. Progressive changes in the appropriate clinical setting are particularly helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Presence of a sequestrum on an x-ray film is highly suggestive of osteomyelitis,\n\n【111】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【112】Osteomyelitis of the symphysis pubis: a separate disease from osteitis pubis: report of three cases and review of the literature.\n\n【113】and CT can help identify this. Radionuclide bone scans often show abnormalities, but care in the interpretation of such findings is necessary because bladder activity overlying the pubic symphysis can be misleading. Early postmicturition or oblique views can overcome this problem. For detecting associated soft tissue masses and sequestra, CT and MRI can be helpful. A microbiologic diagnosis is required for confirming the diagnosis, in distinguishing this condition from osteitis pubis (as discussed previously), and in guiding appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Needle aspiration of the joint or open biopsy is usually successful in obtaining material for culture. Blood cultures are occasionally positive and may eliminate the need for joint aspiration.\n\n【114】Many authors have believed that surgical débridement, particularly in the setting of chronic osteomyelitis, is crucial in the eradication of infection,\n\n【115】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【116】Osteomyelitis of the symphysis pubis: a separate disease from osteitis pubis: report of three cases and review of the literature.\n\n【117】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【118】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【119】Pyogenic infections of the pubic symphysis.\n\n【120】but studies have shown complete healing with antibiotics alone, as in our patient.

Initially, the radiographic appearance may actually worsen despite clinical improvement. However, if the patient's condition does not improve, surgical intervention for abscess drainage or débridement may be necessary. After initial medical or surgical therapy, osteomyelitis can relapse after several years, and hence an extended close follow-up is recommended.\n\n【121】The diagnosis of pubic osteomyelitis is often delayed because of its rarity and the nonspecific signs and symptoms.

First, they are more likely to undergo early menopause, due to chemotherapyinduced ovarian failure or oopherectomy. In addition, chemotherapy may have a direct adverse effect on bone minerai density (BMD), and osteoclastic activity may increase from the breast cancer itself. While estrogen therapy is considered standard for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, use of estrogen in women with a history of breast cancer is usually contraindicated. The approach to osteoporosis in women with breast cancer is also affected by the use of tamoxifen in many, as this drug appears to have opposite effects on BMD in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. We have reviewed therapeutic alternatives for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, focusing on patients with a history of breast cancer. Alendronate and raloxifene are currently approved in the United States for the prevention of osteoporosis; alendronate, raloxifene, and calcitonin are approved for treatment. Alendronate has the greatest positive effect on BMD and reduces the incidence of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. Raloxifene and calcitonin appear to reduce the incidence of vertebral fractures; their effects on the incidence of nonvertebral fractures are not yet proven. Although no published studies specifically address the use of these approved agents for osteoporosis in women with breast cancer, understanding their relative effects on BMD in postmenopausal women in general will facilitate therapy selection in this population. Postmenopausal women with a history of breast cancer should undergo bone mineral analysis. Normal results and absence of other risk factors ensure that calcium and vitamin D intake are adequate. If osteopenia or other risk factors are present, preventive therapy with alendronate or raloxifene should be considered. For osteoporosis, treatment with alendronate should be strongly considered. Raloxifene and calcitonin are alternatives when alendronate is contraindicated. Further studies are needed to evaluate the optimal timing of initial bone mineral analysis in premenopausal women after breast cancer diagnosis and to determine the value of preventive treatment in women scheduled to undergo chemotherapy.\n\n【1】AACE ( American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists ), BMD ( bone mineral density ), CI ( confidence interval ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), MORE ( Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation ), NSABP P-l ( National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-l Study ), WHO ( World Health Organization )\n\n【2】Although the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis is a health concern for many, particular consideration is required for women who are breast cancer survivors. The risk for osteoporosis in these women may be increased due to the effects of cancer therapy and the cancer process itself. Because estrogen therapy, a standard treatment for osteoporosis, is generally contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer, other treatment options are necessary.\n\n【3】Osteoporosis is a state of decreased bone mass leading to skeletal fragility, resulting in an increased risk for fracture with minimal or no trauma.

Osteoporosis is defined as a T score of –2.5 or less, indicating a BMD that is at least 2.5 SDs less than the mean for young adults.\n\n【10】Osteoporosis leads to increased risk of fracture, particularly of the spine, hip, and forearm, causing pain and debilitation.

Decreased bone mass is the most important risk factor for fracture in patients with osteoporosis. Bone mass gradually declines with age in both men and women. However, women experience an accelerated rate of bone loss at the time of menopause. Up to 15% of total bone mass may be lost around the time of natural menopause and up to 20% within 18 months after surgical menopause.\n\n【18】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【19】Prevention of osteoporosis in women treated for hereditary breast and ovarian carcinoma: a need that is overlooked.\n\n【20】Table 1 Risk Factors for Osteoporosis\n\n| Personal history of fracture |\n| --- |\n| Fracture in a first-degree relative |\n| Tobacco or alcohol abuse |\n| Thin body habitus |\n| White race |\n| Estrogen deficiency |\n| Low calcium intake |\n| Drugs (glucocorticoids, phenytoin, heparin, warfarin) |\n| Physical inactivity |\n\n【22】Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, with an estimated 182,800 new cases predicted to be diagnosed in 2000 in the United States.\n\n【23】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【24】Cancer statistics, 2000.\n\n【25】Progress in breast cancer detection and therapy has resulted in an increasing number of women who are long-term survivors of the disease.

Women who also received tamoxifen for no more than 1 year were included. Sixteen of the women remained premenopausal after treatment, while 11 ceased menses during treatment. Those who remained premenopausal had an average age of 39 years, while those who became postmenopausal had an average age of 47.5 years. Those who became postmenopausal had a mean BMD 14% lower than those who remained premenopausal and 7% lower than that expected for a 55–yearold woman. Bruning et al\n\n【38】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【39】Bone mineral density after adjuvant chemotherapy for premenopausal breast cancer.\n\n【40】conducted a case-control study of BMD in 44 pairs of Dutch women with breast cancer. Cases (axillary node involvement without distant metas– tases) had received adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil; controls (node negative) received no chemotherapy. In cases, the mean age at menopause was 41 years (compared with the normal age at menopause of 51–52 years for Dutch women), and 71% were postmenopausal at the time of the study. In controls, the mean age at menopause was 47 years, and 16% were postmenopausal at the time of the study. Premenopausal women had significantly higher BMD than postmenopausal women, regardless of treatment group. The outcomes of these 2 studies indicate that women treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer are likely to undergo a premature menopause accompanied by an acceleration of bone loss. As a result, they may have an increased risk for fracture at an earlier age than normal.\n\n【41】Table 2 Proposed Additional Risk Factors for Osteoporosis in Women With Breast Cancer\n\n| Premature ovarian failure |\n| --- |\n| Direct effect of chemotherapy drugs |\n| Direct effect of breast cancer |\n| Effect of antiestrogen hormonal agents |\n\n【43】In addition to the risk for early menopause induced by surgical or chemotherapeutic ovarian ablation, chemotherapeutic agents used in the treatment of breast cancer may have a direct adverse effect on BMD.

Eighty-two women with recurrent breast cancer and 352 women with a first diagnosis of breast cancer (regardless of stage) were enrolled in separate studies of the effects of clodronate on incidence of skeletal metastases. None of the women had skeletal metastases at the time of enrollment. The age-adjusted prevalence of vertebral fracture was similar in the group at first diagnosis and the control population; in women with recurrent breast cancer it was 6–fold higher ( _P_ <.0001). However, compared with the general population, the annual incidence of vertebral fracture in women followed up from first breast cancer diagnosis was nearly 5 times greater ( _P_ <.0001), and in women with recurrent disease it was more than 20 times greater _(P<.0001)._ When women who developed skeletal metastases during the study period were excluded from analysis, the odds ratios for the annual incidence of vertebral fracture in women followed up from first breast cancer diagnosis and those with recurrent disease compared with the control population were 2.8 (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.3–6.2) and 24.5 (95% CI, 10.755.9), respectively. The authors of this study proposed that the risk of vertebral fracture demonstrated was actually an underestimate, because half the women with breast cancer were receiving clodronate, which has positive effects on BMD and has been shown to decrease the incidence of vertebral fracture in women with breast cancer and women with osteoporosis.\n\n【53】PREVENTION AND TREATMENT\n------------------------\n\n【54】The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) recommends basic osteoporosis preventive measures for women with T scores between –1.5 and –2.5 and consideration of antiresorptive therapy if the T score is –2.5 or lower or if basic preventive measures are ineffective at preserving bone density.\n\n【55】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【56】*   AACE clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis\n\n【57】The National Osteoporosis Foundation advises treatment of women without risk factors who have T scores of –2.0 or lower or women with risk factors who have T scores of –1.5 or lower.\n\n【58】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【59】*   National Osteoporosis Foundation\n\n【60】Physician's Guide to Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis.

An additional 435 women were randomly assigned to one of these treatment groups or to open-label estrogen-progestin therapy (0.625/5 mg). The mean baseline lumbar spine BMD was 0.94 g/cm <sup>2 </sup> , and although no T scores were given, less than 10% of women enrolled had a baseline lumbar spine BMD of less than 0.8 g/cm <sup>2 </sup> . Follow up was for 2 years. Women taking 5 mg of alendronate (n=445) daily had a mean increase in BMD of the lumbar spine of 3.5% at 2 years ( _P<_ .00l), while women taking placebo (n=461) had a mean loss of 1.8%. Similarly, women in the 5–mg alendronate group had a mean increase in femoral neck BMD of 1.3% at 2 years ( _P<_ .00l) compared with a decrease of 1.6% ( _P<_ .00l) in the placebo group.

The initial dosage of alendronate was 5 mg/d, but this was changed to 10 mg/d at 24 months. The women were divided into 2 groups, based on presence or absence of 1 or more vertebral fractures at baseline. In the group preexisting vertebral fractures, 2027 women were enrolled, and follow-up was for 36 months. New vertebral fractures, identified radiographically, were observed in 8% of women assigned to alendronate and in 15% assigned to placebo (relative risk, 0.53; _P_ <.001). The incidence of clinically apparent vertebral fractures was 2.3% in the alendronate group and 5% in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.45; _P<.001),_ and the risk of any clinical fracture was 13.6% in the alendronate group and 18.2% in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.72; _P=.004)._ In the group without preexisting vertebral fractures, 4432 women were enrolled and followed up for 4 years. Although there was an overall reduction in clinical fractures of 14% in the alendronate vs the placebo group, this difference was not statistically significant. A significant reduction of 36% was found, however, in a subset analysis of women with T scores at the femoral neck of –2.5 or less. There was an overall reduction in radiographically detected vertebral fractures of 44% in the alendronate group.\n\n【140】Pols et al\n\n【141】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【142】Fosamax International Trial Study Group. Multinational, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of the effects of alendronate on bone density and fracture risk in postmenopausal women with low bone mass: results of the FOSIT study.\n\n【143】demonstrated a significant reduction in nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with T scores of –2 or less who were randomized to alendronate vs placebo for 12 months ( _P_ \\=.021). A meta-analysis of alendronate therapy, compiling data from 5 studies and 1347 patient-years, was performed by Karpf et a1.\n\n【144】<sup><a>37</a></sup>\n\n【145】Alendronate Osteoporosis Treatment Study Groups.\n\n【146】The estimated relative risk of nonvertebral fractures after 3 years in patients treated with alendronate was 0.71 compared with placebo. The estimated cumulative fracture incidence was 9% in alendronate-treated patients and 12.6% in patients receiving placebo.\n\n【147】The main adverse effects of alendronate are gastrointestinal. and include dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and esophageal irritation. Although there is concern over reports of esophageal ulcers and esophageal strictures associated with alendronate, serious or severe esophageal reactions have been reported in only 1.3% to 1.5% of pa tients.\n\n【148】<sup><a>38</a></sup>\n\n【149】United Kingdom experience with alendronate and oesophageal reactions.\n\n【150】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【151】<sup><a>39</a></sup>\n\n【152】Physicians' Desk Reference. 52nd ed. Medical Economics Co lnc , Montvalc, NJ 1998 : 1660\n\n【153】These adverse effects can largely be avoided if the patient drinks 8 oz of water with each dose and maintains an upright posture for at least 30 minutes. Inability to do so is a contraindication to the use of alendronate, as are preexisting esophageal stricture and achalasia. Gastroesophageal reflux is a relative contraindication. Hypocalcemia and hypersensitivity to bisphosphonates are the only other contraindications to the use of alendronate.\n\n【154】The portion of the drug that is not absorbed by bone (approximately 50%) is excreted renally. No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with creatinine clearance of at least 35 mL/min, but if creatinine clearance is less than this, the drug should be used with caution, if at all. The approximate cost of a 30–day supply of alendronate (5–mg or 10–mg dosage) is $69 (written communication, J. S. Novak, RPh, Mayo Clinic Outpatient Pharmacy, Jacksonville, Fla, March 1999).\n\n【155】**Other Bisphosphonates.** –Although an extensive search revealed no similar studies involving alendronate, several studies have evaluated the effectiveness of other bisphosphonates (available in Europe) in the prevention of osteoporosis in breast cancer patients. Delmas et al\n\n【156】<sup><a>40</a></sup>\n\n【157】Bisphosphonate risedronate prevents bone loss in women with artificial menopause due to chemotherapy of breast cancer: a double blind, placebo controlled study.\n\n【158】randomized 53 women who had been postmenopausal for at least 6 months secondary to adjuvant chemotherapy to receive oral risedronate or placebo for 2 years. After 3 years of follow-up (1 year after discontinuation of study drug), both groups had lost bone mass. However, there was significantly less decrease in BMD of the lumbar spine and the femoral neck in patients who received risedronate.\n\n【159】Saarto et al\n\n【160】<sup><a>41</a></sup>\n\n【161】Chemical castration induced by adjuvant cyclophosphamide, methotrexaie, and fluorouracil chemotherapy causes rapid bone loss that is reduced by clodronate: a randomized study in premeno-pausal breast cancer patients.\n\n【162】evaluated the effect of clodronate on BMD in premenopausal women treated with adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. The study randomized 148 women with newly diagnosed,nonmetastatic primary breast tumors with axillary node involvement to receive oral clodronate (1600 mg/d) or placebo for 3 years. All patients were treated with mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery with axillary node dissection, postoperative radiation therapy, and 6 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil. Oral clodronate was started with the first cycle of chemotherapy. Of the 113 women included in the first-year analysis, 38% were amenorrheic at the end of the first year, 36% had irregular menses, and 22% continued to have regular menses; data on 4% of the patients were not provided. The mean ages in each of these groups were 48, 43, and 37 years, respectively. All patients who received placebo lost bone mass at the lumbar spine and femoral neck (mean decreases in BMD, –5.9% and –2.0%, respectively) with the greatest loss in women who became amenorrheic (−9.5% at the lumbar spine and –4.6% at the femoral neck). There was significantly less bone loss in women treated with clodronate (–2.2% at the lumbar spine and _+0.9%_ at the femoral neck), and treated women who continued to have regular menses actually gained bone mass at both sites. The _P_ values for the differences between the changes in BMD of placebo and control groups at the lumbar spine and femoral neck were .0005 and .017, respectively.\n\n【163】Powles et al\n\n【164】<sup><a>42</a></sup>\n\n【165】Oral clodronate and reduction in loss of bone mineral density in women with operable primary breast cancer.\n\n【166】evaluated the effectiveness of clodronate on BMD as part of a larger study of its effect on the incidence of bone metastases in women with primary breast cancer. In this study, 311 women with operable primary breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive clodronate or placebo for 2 years. Clodronate had a significant positive effect on the mean change in BMD at both the hip and the lumbar spine (differences between placebo and control groups of 1.72% at the lumbar spine and 1.85% at the total hip; _P_ \\=.04 and .008, respectively).\n\n【167】The results of these 2 studies indicate that preventive treatment for osteoporosis in premenopausal women un dergoing therapy for breast cancer may be beneficial. Further study is required to identify which groups of women would benefit most from such an approach and to better define other effects of bisphosphonates in this population.\n\n【168】### Calcitonin\n\n【169】Although intranasal calcitonin has been shown to have a positive effect on BMD, it is not as effective in this regard as alendronate . It is approved for treatment of osteoporosis but not for prevention. In a dose-finding trial conducted by Overgaard et al,\n\n【170】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【171】Effect of salcalonin given intranasally on bone mass and fracture rates in established osteoporosis: a dose-response study.\n\n【172】81 women with osteopenia (no T scores reported) were randomized to receive either placebo or intranasal calcitonin, 200 IU/d, and followed up for 2 years. There was an increase in mean bone mineral content of the lumbar spine of 3% in the calcitonin group, compared with an increase of 1% in the placebo group ( _P_ \\=.008). There was also a significant reduction of the vertebral fracture rate in the treated group (3% vs 15% in the placebo group), but the total number of fractures was small (10 new fractures).\n\n【173】Thamsborg et al\n\n【174】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【175】Effect of nasal salmon calcitonin on bone remodeling and bone mass in postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n\n【176】evaluated calcitonin therapy in 62 postmenopausal women with previous Colles fractures and mean lumbar spine BMD at baseline of 0.83 g/cm <sup>2 </sup> (no T scores reported). No significant differences were found between treatment and placebo groups in percentage change in BMD of the lumbar spine or femoral neck after 2 years of follow-up.\n\n【177】However, Kapetanos et al\n\n【178】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【179】A double blind study of intranasal calcitonin for established postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n\n【180】found a dramatic difference in percentage change of lumbar spine, femoral neck, and trochanter BMD (6.9, 15.2, and 26.8 g/cm <sup>2 </sup> , respectively) between treatment and placebo groups in 46 women followed up for 1 year. Study participants in this trial were carefully selected (postmenopausal women with at least 1 previous vertebral fracture, lumbar spine BMD less than 0.85 g/cm <sup>2 </sup> , and biochemical indicators of rapid bone turnover), possibly accounting, at least in part, for the discrepancy between the results of this study and that conducted by Thamsborg et a1.\n\n【181】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【182】Effect of nasal salmon calcitonin on bone remodeling and bone mass in postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n\n【183】In a study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of calcitonin in preventing bone loss in healthy postmenopausal women, Reginster et al\n\n【184】<sup><a>43</a></sup>\n\n【185】A double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding trial of intermittent nasal salmon calcitonin for prevention of postmenopausal lumbar spine bone loss.\n\n【186】reported a difference in percentage change from baseline of lumbar spine BMD between placebo and calcitonin groups of 6.1 percentage points for a dose of 50 IU/d and of 8.31 percentage points for a dose of 200 IU/d. The study involved 251 women, and follow-up was for 2 years. The authors concluded that calcitonin, given intranasally in a dose of 50 IU/d, was effective in preventing bone loss in the lumbar spine of postmenopausal women. Another study of calcitonin (100 IU/d) conducted by Overgaard et al\n\n【187】<sup><a>44</a></sup>\n\n【188】Effect of salcatonin given intranasally on early postmenopausal bone loss.\n\n【189】in 52 early postmenopausal women, showed that although there was a significant reduction of bone loss at the lumbar spine, there was no effect on peripheral bone loss (determined by bone mineral content of the total skeleton and forearm).\n\n【190】In summary, calcitonin appears to be effective in treating postmenopausal osteoporosis, although less so than alendronate. The effect may be greater in women with high rates of bone turnover. The interim results of a large randomized controlled trial of calcitonin for the prevention of recurrent osteoporotic fractures indicate that treatment with calcitonin may lead to a significant reduction in the number of new vertebral fractures in women with osteoporosis.\n\n【191】<sup><a>45</a></sup>\n\n【192】Salmon-calcilonin nasal spray prevents vertebral fractures in established osteoporosis: further interim results of the PROOF study \\[abstract\\].\n\n【193】A significant reduction in hip fractures has not yet been shown with the use of calcitonin. Our literature search produced no studies that assessed the use of calcitonin in women with breast cancer. The approximate cost of a 30day supply of intranasal calcitonin is $65 (written communication, J. S. Novak, March 1999).\n\n【194】### Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators\n\n【195】**Raloxifene** .–Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator with a positive effect on BMD and lipid profile and no effect on endometrial thickness compared with placebo. It is approved in the United States for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Its positive effect on BMD is less than that of alemdronate or estrogen but greater than that of .\n\n【196】Delmas et al\n\n【197】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【198】Effects of raloxifene on bone mineral density, serum cholesterol concentrations, and uterine endometrium in postmenopausal women.\n\n【199】randomized 601 postmenopausal women aged 45 to 60 years to receive either raloxifene or placebo for 24 months. Three doses of raloxifene were used (30 mg, 60 mg, 150 mg): 150 women received placebo and 152 received raloxifene, 60 mg/d. Only these groups are considered here, as the FDA-approved dose of raloxifene is 60 mg. At baseline, the mean lumbar spine BMD was 0.94 g/cm <sup>2 </sup> (T scores between –2.5 and +2). At the end of 2 years, significant differences were noted between these 2 groups in the mean percentage change in BMD of the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip (differences of 2.4, 2.5, and 2.4 percentage points, respectively). In the 60–mg raloxifene group, there was an increase of 2.4% in BMD of the lumbar spine and total hip ( _P<_ .001). The effect at the hip was comparable to that of alemdronate or estrogen, but the effect at the spine was less than that of either of these other drugs. Of importance, raloxifene appeared to increase BMD without stimulating endometrial proliferation. Raloxifene also had a positive effect on serum cholesterol levels, demonstrating a significantly greater reduction of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels than placebo. There was no significant effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglyceride levels.\n\n【200】In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) study.\n\n【201】<sup><a>30</a></sup>\n\n【202】Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) Investigators. Reduction of vertebral fracture risk in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis treated with raloxifene: results from a 3-year randomized clinical trial \\[published correction appears in _JAMA._ 1999:282:2124.\n\n【203】7705 women aged 31 to 80 years who met WHO standards for osteoporosis and were at least 2 years postmenopausal were randomized to receive raloxifene (60 or 120 mg/d) or placebo. There was a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures in both raloxifene groups compared with placebo (relative risk, 0.7 \\[95% CI, 0.5–0.8\\] for the 60–mg group vs placebo). The difference was found in women with and without preexisting vertebral fractures. There was no difference between treatment and placebo groups in the incidence of nonvertebral fractures. Significant increases in BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck were noted for both the 60mg and the 120–mg groups compared with placebo (2.6% and 2.7%, respectively; _P_ <.001).\n\n【204】Our literature search identified no studies evaluating raloxifene's effect.on osteoporosis in women with breast cancer. In the MORE trial, there was a significant reduction of breast cancer incidence in women treated with raloxifene, and a multicenter study is under way to compare the relative efficacies of raloxifene and tamoxifen for prevention of breast cancer in high-risk women.\n\n【205】Important adverse effects of raloxifene include hot flashes, leg cramps, and a slight increase in the incidence of venous thrombosis (similar to that seen with estrogen). Data compiled from several trials that included 10,400 women indicate that the relative risk of deep venous thrombosis for women taking raloxifene compared with placebo is 3.\n\n【206】<sup><a>46</a></sup>\n\n【207】Effects of raloxifene in postmenopausal women \\[letter\\].\n\n【208】The approximate cost of a 30–day supply of raloxifene is $70 (written communication, J. S. Novak, March 1999).\n\n【209】**Tamoxifen.** –Tamoxifen is a standard part of therapy for women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. It has also been approved recently to decrease the incidence of breast cancer for certain women at high risk. Tamoxifen is an estrogen antagonist in breast tissue and has variable effects on bone. Although it is not approved for prevention or treatment of osteoporosis, consideration of its effect on BMD is important. In Premenopausal women, tamoxifen has been shown to decrease BMD compared with placebo, while in postmenopausal women, it has the opposite effect.\n\n【210】<sup><a>47</a></sup>\n\n【211】Effect of tamoxifen on bone mineral density measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in healthy premenopausal and postmenopausal women.\n\n【212】These factors must be taken into consideration in decisions about preventing and treating bone loss in women for whom tamoxifen is prescribed.\n\n【213】In a study conducted by Love et al,\n\n【214】<sup><a>48</a></sup>\n\n【215】Effects of tamoxifen on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women with breast cancer.\n\n【216】140 postmenopausal women with node-negative breast cancer were randomized to receive tamoxifen or placebo for 2 years. In the tamoxifen group, lumbar spine BMD increased by 0.61% per year ( _P_ \\=.04), while it decreased by 1% per year ( _P<_ .001) in the placebo group. Radial BMD decreased significantly in both groups. In a large retrospective study of 1716 postmenopausal Danish women with primary breast cancer randomized to receive radiation therapy with or without tamoxifen, Kristensen et al\n\n【217】<sup><a>49</a></sup>\n\n【218】Femoral fractures in postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.\n\n【219】found no statistically significant difference in femoral fractures between groups. In the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P–1 Study (NSABP P-l), Fisher et al\n\n【220】<sup><a>50</a></sup>\n\n【221】Tamoxifen for prevention of breast cancer: report of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project P-1 Study.\n\n【222】observed a nonstatistically significant reduction in hip, radius (Colles), and spine fractures in women treated with tamoxifen. Fracture was not a primary end point of this trial, however, and separate results for Premenopausal and postmenopausal women were not reported.\n\n【223】**Phytoestrogens** .–Phytoestrogens are plant compounds with mixed estrogen agonist and antagonist properties. They are found in many different foods, including soy, and are contained in numerous over-the–counter supplements. Beneficial effects on bone have been proposed for these substances but remain unproven at this time. Ipriflavone.\n\n【224】<sup><a>51</a></sup>\n\n【225】Effect of ipriflavone on bone mass in elderly osteoporotic women.\n\n【226】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【227】<sup><a>52</a></sup>\n\n【228】Effects of combined low dose of the isoflavone derivative ipriflavone and estrogen replacement on bone mineral density and metabolism in postmenopausal women.\n\n【229】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【230】<sup><a>53</a></sup>\n\n【231】Effect of ipriflavone-a synthetic derivative of natural isoflavones-on bone mass loss in the early years after menopause.\n\n【232】a synthetic derivative of naturally occurring soy isoflavones, is under investigation for a possible preventive or treatment role in osteoporosis, but conclusive data are not yet available. Thus, there is insufficient evidence on which to base recommendations for or against the use of these agents in prevention or treatment of osteoporosis. Additionally, the effect of these agents on the risk of breast cancer has not been adequately assessed, making it even more premature to recommend this in women who have already been diagnosed with this disease.\n\n【233】### Other Agents\n\n【234】Sodium fluoride has been shown to have a large positive effect on cancellous (lumbar spine) BMD but to lead to a decrease in cortical BMD,\n\n【235】<sup><a>54</a></sup>\n\n【236】Effect of fluoride treatment on the fracture rate in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.\n\n【237】perhaps by causing a redistribution of bone.

Sodium fluoride is not FDA approved for prevention or treatment of osteoporosis at this time, but studies are ongoing.\n\n【250】Parathyroid hormone is being studied for its effect on bone mass and fracture incidence, with some encouraging results in small studies.\n\n【251】<sup><a>58</a></sup>\n\n【252】Treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.\n\n【253】It does not have FDA approval for either the prevention or treatment of osteoporosis at this time.

The decision to use antiresorptive therapy for prevention should be individualized on the basis of age, overall health and functional status, assessment of risk factors, and T scores. For those on a basic prevention program, the AACE recommends bone mineral analysis every 1 to 2 years until bone mass is stable, after which follow-up measurements can be done every 2 to 3 years. For those on a therapeutic program with antiresorptive agents, their recommendation is for 3 consecutive annual measurements, followed by biannual testing if bone mass is stable.\n\n【261】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【262】*   AACE clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis\n\n【263】Calcium and vitamin D are fundamental components of osteoporosis prevention and treatment but cannot be considered a substitute for antiresorptive therapy in women with significant osteoporosis or in osteopenic women at high risk for further bone loss or fracture. The recommended daily intake of calcium is 1000 mg for young to middle-aged adults and 1500 mg for postmenopausal women older than 50 years who are not taking estrogen.\n\n【264】<sup><a>34</a></sup>\n\n【265】*   Optimal calcium intake\n\n【266】_NIH Consens Statement_ \\[online\\].\n\n【267】Available at: odp.od.nih.gov/consensus/cons/097/097\\_statemenl.htm\n\n【268】Dietary supplementation with 400 IU/d of vitamin D (the amount contained in most multivitamins) is generally recommended.\n\n【269】Regular physical activity is also beneficial and should be encouraged. In a prospective cohort study of 9704 nonblack women aged 65 years or older, higher levels of physical activity were positively correlated with fewer hip fractures, even after adjustments for falls, functional and overall health status, age, and diet. There was a relative risk reduction of 33% to 42% in hip and vertebral fractures in moderately to highly active women compared with inactive women.\n\n【270】<sup><a>61</a></sup>\n\n【271】Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Research Group. Physical activity and osteoporotic fracture risk in older women.\n\n【272】The FDA-approved antiresorptive agents for prevention of osteoporosis, other than estrogen, include alendronate and raloxifene. The efficacy of alendronate appears to be greater than that of raloxifene. However, raloxifene has a beneficial effect on total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and may therefore be a good choice for women with hyperlipidemia.\n\n【273】Whether raloxifene should be favored as the preventive agent of choice for osteoporosis in women with a history of or at high risk for breast cancer remains to be determined. The use of raloxifene in women previously treated for breast cancer with tamoxifen has not yet been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. The ongoing Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene is designed to compare the effectiveness of these 2 drugs in the prevention of breast cancer. The study seeks to enroll 22,000 postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer development. Since women who previously participated in NSABP P–1 will be included, the study will provide important information on the sequential use of tamoxifen and raloxifene. Studies to evaluate the effect of raloxifene on breast cancer recurrence in women with a .history of the disease (with and without previous tamoxifen treatment) who are treated with this agent for osteoporosis need to be conducted.\n\n【274】For treatment of established osteoporosis, FDA-approved choices in this population include alendronate, raloxifene, and calcitonin. Based on the data reviewed, alendronate appears to be the best choice, unless it is contraindicated or not tolerated. The efficacy of combination treatments remains to be established. The results of a phase 2 study by Johnell et al\n\n【275】<sup><a>62</a></sup>\n\n【276】Effects of raloxifene (RLX), alendronate (ALN) and RLX+ALN on bone mineral density (BMD) and biochemical markers of bone turnover in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis \\[abstract\\].\n\n【277】indicate that the combination of alendronate and raloxifene may increase BMD in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis more than either drug alone. Since limited data are available to date, however, combination therapy should be reserved for women with osteoporosis who have failed therapy with a single agent.\n\n【278】In conclusion, medications effective at preventing and treating osteoporosis without increasing the risk of breast cancer recurrence are available, and women with breast cancer should be made aware of these options. Further studies are needed to evaluate the optimal timing of initial bone mineral analysis in premenopausal women after breast cancer diagnosis and to determine the value of pre– ventive treatment in women scheduled to undergo chemotherapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

This new section will feature scholarly work in biomedical ethics and the health humanities. Its goal is to promote critical analysis of foundational questions that are central to the values of medicine and public health. We invite contributors to explore emerging issues and under-examined topics in health care, particularly topics that have broad social impact or the potential to transform the practice of medicine. Consistent with its name, _The Compass_ will seek to move medicine forward by clarifying professional commitments and considering creative problem-solving strategies. Contributors are encouraged to contact one of the section editors before submitting articles, which may take any number of forms including Original Articles, Concise Reviews for Clinicians, Subject Reviews, Special Articles, Commentaries, and Perspectives and Controversies. Articles will be peer reviewed, with emphasis placed on the unique contribution of the manuscript to broader debates in medicine and society.\n\n【5】It is particularly noteworthy that this series begins in a year that marks the 80th anniversary of the deaths of 3 Mayo pioneers who were central to the creation of team-based health care. Within a 4-month period during the spring and summer of 1939, as the world braced itself for the looming Second World War, Sr Mary Joseph Dempsey, OSF; Dr Charles Horace Mayo; and Dr William James Mayo all died. They were indefatigable champions of medical integrity and steadfast advocates for their patients. All faithfully collaborated to establish a broad and enduring covenant to serve others, a commitment to an empathic presence in the face of human suffering, and an abiding trust in the moral foundation of medical caregivers.\n\n【6】In this new section of the journal, we hope to re-establish a sense of direction in the face of the abiding ambiguity of life. The Latin ancestor of “compass” is derived from a conjunction of “com”, or “together” and “passus” or “a step or pace.”\n\n【7】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【8】Oxford English Dictionary Online.\n\n【9】Compass is the root of the word “compassion,” one interpretation of which implies “traveling together on a journey” and suggests the importance of the concept of “presence” to each other.\n\n【10】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【11】Presence.\n\n【12】The compass that is represented by the navigational instrument we think of today is related to the Italian _compasso_ , the familiar circular shape of the compass box.\n\n【13】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【14】Oxford English Dictionary Online.\n\n【15】Additional meanings refer to the instrument used to draw arcs or circles, to measure distance between points, as well as to indicate musical range.\n\n【16】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【17】Oxford English Dictionary Online.\n\n【18】In this context, the word “compass” may be used as a verb, connoting the creation of careful circular movement that traverses all sides of a terrain. Rumi's reference to the compass in his ode to love speaks of one foot grounded and another circling in the seemingly boundless space of inspiration.\n\n【19】Each of these interpretations of the word “compass” is a metaphor for the scholarly and creative discussions we hope this series will nurture. _The Compass_ will be a highly contemporary forum, focusing on the implications of emerging issues in medicine and the health sciences: questions of moral and clinical decision making including the central role of presence in dealing with medical uncertainties and the many vulnerabilities of illness (for both caregivers and patients). We will strive to examine the concept of value in applied ethical thought, using traditional forms of research and scholarship as well less common creative media. We aim to travel the boundaries of form and function to facilitate interconnection and reciprocity among the medical humanities. Finally, we endeavor to understand how these scholarly efforts are to be incorporated into the arc of professional development that affects not only the caregiver but also the care of the patient over the long term.\n\n【20】The legacy left by the Franciscan Sisters and the Mayo family is very much alive and is itself a compass for making our way in these challenging times. It is a legacy marked by curiosity, collegiality, and the cultivation of presence. It approaches medicine as a moral enterprise dedicated to the alleviation of human suffering and the promotion of human flourishing. It requires an interdisciplinary calculus informed by a sense of adventure and creativity, seasoned by humility, and guided in no small part by the wisdom of the past and the value of community and connection.\n\n【21】One can only speculate as to what may have been on the minds of the Mayo community those 80 years ago as they looked to an uncertain future without the reliable compass of a generation passed. Some today may bemoan the challenges to communication and presence in this digital age, but a look back in our history reveals anxiety in every epoch. It is our hope that _The Compass_ will give voice to the many humanistic attributes of medicine including not only ambiguity and failure but also hope, joy, and the striving for excellence within an increasingly technological world.\n\n【22】The English novelist E. M. Forster wrote in a diary entry in January 1908, when a successful kilometer-long airplane flight was reported, “The little houses I am used to will be swept away, the fields will stink of petrol, and the airships will shatter the stars.… Such a soul as mine will be crushed out.”\n\n【23】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【24】Howards End.\n\n【25】Edward Arnold Publishers Ltd , London, UK 1973 : x-xi\n\n【26】His fears are characterized by disorganization, a sense of isolation and desolation, wherein the stars by which the ancient mariners sought direction are rendered invisible, leaving the sojourner adrift without direction. As in Forster's time, today's new technologies, ways of mining data of all kinds, advances in digital communication, and the accelerating pace of artificial intelligence create both anxiety and opportunity focused on the agency and the future direction of humanity itself.\n\n【27】These new languages will require new literacies in our culture at large and in their applications in health care. In his book _Robot-Proof_ , the academic Joseph Aoun cites the importance of 4 cognitive capacities essential to interdisciplinary transformational learning needed to navigate the digital future: critical thinking; systems thinking; entrepreneurship, defined as the capacity to create value in original ways; and cultural agility.\n\n【28】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【29】Robot Proof: Higher Education in the Age of Artificial Intelligence.\n\n【30】MIT Press , Cambridge, MA 2017 : 4\n\n【31】It is not coincidental that the new School of Artificial Intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology plans to integrate faculty from computer sciences with those of other disciplines, most notably the humanities.\n\n【32】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【33】The Bulgarian-French philosopher and psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva encourages a more active role for the health humanities, as ”… a cross-disciplinary and cross-cultural space for a bidirectional critical interrogation of both biomedicine (simple reductions of life to biology) and the humanities (simple reduction of suffering and health injustice to cultural relativism), considering the humanities along with medicine as biocultural practices.”\n\n【34】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【35】Cultural crossings of care: an appeal to the medical humanities.\n\n【36】The language that brokers this interrogation is grounded in ethical dialogue. It is a prerequisite in clarifying the moral perspectives to help direct the work of both physician and patient and of both biomedicine and cultural meanings of illness in a co-construction of shared meaning that can generate real results.\n\n【37】On the occasion of his 70th birthday, Dr William J. Mayo made the following observation: “I look through a half-opened door into the future, full of interest, intriguing beyond my power to describe but with a full understanding that it is for each generation to solve its own problems and that no man has the wisdom to guide or control the next generation.”\n\n【38】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【39】The Doctors Mayo.\n\n【40】It is our hope that through _The Compass_ , our colleagues—wherever they may be—will have a forum to contribute their expertise in the service of solving those challenges that we have only just begun to appreciate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The cumulative incidence of PD was 2.42% lower in the RA cohort than in the non-RA cohort. The risk reduction of PD development in patients affected with RA was independent of treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs); subgroup analysis of patients treated with biologic DMARDs revealed further risk reduction (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.41-0.79).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Patients with RA have a reduced risk of developing PD.

Within weeks, partygoers would have access to a comprehensive report, including their genetic preference for vegetables, whether their tongue curled, and their risk of developing breast cancer. In Silicon Valley, at the height of the dotcom boom, 23andMe was at the vanguard of a wave of interest in personal genomics. Competitors deCODE and Navigenics also offered genome panels, whereas companies such as Ancestry.com offered to interpret people's DNA and trace their ethnic ancestry.\n\n【16】As the name suggests, DTC genetic testing companies offer genetic tests independent of a physician. Some tests include nonmedical “infotainment” such as ear lobe attachment or the propensity to flush when drinking alcohol. In the past, however, these tests were bundled with risk factors for complex diseases such as type 2 diabetes and osteoporosis or monogenic disease such as _BRCA1_ and _BRCA2_ for breast and ovarian cancers.\n\n【17】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【18】Personal utility in genomic testing: is there such a thing?\n\n【19】Although these genetic analyses had been technically possible for years, the cost of testing was financially prohibitive. In 2007, the cost of a DTC panel hovered around $1000.\n\n【20】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【21】Where are you going, where have you been: A recent history of the direct-to-consumer genetic testing market.\n\n【22】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【23】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【24】The current landscape for direct-to-consumer genetic testing: Legal, ethical, and policy issues.\n\n【25】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【26】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【27】Direct-to-consumer genetic testing: perceptions, problems, and policy responses.\n\n【28】Three years later it dropped to between $300 and $400.

Some products allowed users to conduct a “family search” of the database to determine whether other users may be relatives. “Our DNA is a fascinating aspect of who we are, and we feel strongly that anyone who wants their genetic data should be able to get access to it,” the authors of the 23andMe blog posted.\n\n【35】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【36】The power of We.\n\n【37】Some scientific sources agreed. The journal _Science_ named human genetic variation the “breakthrough of the year” and highlighted 23andMe in its coverage. “The best outcomes \\[of DTC genetics\\],” wrote the editorial board of _Nature Genetics_ , “would be to convert patients into active investigators and navigators of their own health, to make genetics the foundation of medical education\\[,\\] and to expand the scope of genetic counseling as a profession.”\n\n【38】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【39】Positively disruptive.\n\n【40】Fast forward 5 years to 2012, when most DTC companies offering medical information in the United States had gone out of business (although DNA-based ancestry testing remained commercially available). Only one of the early pioneers in this sector remained, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had temporarily barred it from selling medical information panels. Nevertheless, there was a movement toward a new form of consumer-initiated genetic testing, what we call DTC 2.0.\n\n【41】Fast forward again to 2017, when the FDA has authorized the first DTC test as an approved medical device. Energized by this regulatory development, other companies are actively working to obtain similar approvals. In this article, we review the history of DTC genetic testing products in the United States from an ethical and regulatory perspective. Although the status of these products remains in flux, we will attempt to characterize DTC 2.0 and its potential implications. Direct-to-consumer 2.0 represents a new model of disseminating, using, and interacting with genetic health data, a model that has the potential to be either transformative or disruptive, depending on how key ethical and regulatory challenges are addressed.\n\n【42】Rise and Fall of DTC 1.0\n------------------------\n\n【43】The initial rise of the DTC model of genetic testing was, at least partially, a reaction to traditional health care models of providing genetic testing. The medical model is characterized by a dependence on expert knowledge and the structural elements of the health care system. A medical professional, operating within a fiduciary patient-provider relationship, orders clinically indicated genetic testing and licensed, board-certified medical genetic providers interpret and deliver results. The health care system is the mediator of genetic information, responsible for its quality, creation, interpretation, delivery, protection, and implications. In particular, the medical model is committed to protecting the privacy of health information, including genetic information. Patients retain the ability to control which organizations have access to their data. Like all medical care, the model is designed to maximize patient benefit and promote informed clinical decision making while minimizing associated risks.\n\n【44】This medical model has its drawbacks. Private sector actors frequently complain that it innovates too slowly because of regulation and professional resistance to new practices. Some have argued that resistance to new medical decision-making technologies stems from the desire of medical actors to preserve professional autonomy.\n\n【45】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【46】Direct to consumer genetic testing: avoiding a culture war.\n\n【47】There is also a lack of skilled medical genetics practitioners; medical genetics is one of the smallest medical subspecialties and many areas of the country are not well served by medical geneticists or genetic counselors.\n\n【48】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【49】Deficiency of knowledge of genetics and genetic tests among general practitioners, gynecologists, and pediatricians: a global problem.\n\n【50】Finally, many see medical genetics as having failed to live up to the hype surrounding human genetics and genomics research. The completion of the Human Genome Project generated enormous public appetite for information on the democratizing promises that spurred unprecedented public investment in genetics. By contrast, medical genetics was focused on restricting genetic information to medical records and expert interpretation.\n\n【51】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【52】The current landscape for direct-to-consumer genetic testing: Legal, ethical, and policy issues.\n\n【53】These drawbacks, combined with the plummeting cost of sequencing and what Wolinsky observes as a cultural motivation toward a “do-it-yourself” American ethic, made the US fertile ground for consumers and suppliers of DTC genetic testing.\n\n【54】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【55】Direct-to-consumer genetic testing: ethical-legal perspectives and practical considerations.\n\n【56】In contrast to the medical model, the DTC model is premised on a libertarian foundation and disdain for the elitism of expert regulation and control . In the DTC model, consumers send a saliva sample by mail and the results are viewed directly via the Internet or a mobile app. Direct-to-consumer proponents regard access to personal genetic information as a “right” that each citizen should enjoy. They cite the convenience of DTC testing, its promotion of preventive and individualized medicine, and reduced costs to both individual consumers and the health care system.\n\n【57】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【58】Primary care physicians' awareness, experience and opinions of direct-to-consumer genetic testing.\n\n【59】Implicit in the promotion of DTC testing is a criticism of the medical profession as being overly cautious about genetic information, with a suggestion that medical professionals are interested largely in preserving their own authority and revenue streams.\n\n【60】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【61】Direct to consumer genetic testing: avoiding a culture war.\n\n【62】Table 1 Key Points of Comparison Between Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing and “Traditional” Medical Testing\n\n| Key aspect | Direct-to-consumer testing | Traditional medical testing |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Testing initiation | Patient initiates test | Health care worker initiates test |\n| Source of regulation | Companies are regulated as consumer products | Health care systems are regulated by industry-specific rules |\n| Information control | Patient controls and manages genetic information | Health care system controls and manages information |\n| Data interpretation source | Patient chooses interpreter of genetic information | Agents of the health care system interpret genetic information |\n| Quality control | Test quality is largely unregulated | Regulations and quality control systems in place to assess test quality |\n| End use | Interpretation can be for multiple purposes, eg, ancestry, paternity, and health | Interpretation facilitates medical management |\n| Pricing model | Intense competition may drive down product price | Product price is tied to the health care payment model |\n| Return of information | Information may come without clinical support or counseling services | Information is delivered by health care professionals |\n| Data interpretation regulation | Information interpreters are typically not accredited | Information interpreters are licensed or accredited |\n| Secondary use | For-profit selling of data for secondary use | Secondary use largely limited to health care research purposes |\n\n【64】Critics of the DTC model countered with their own concerns. Many of the tests on DTC panels were based on genome-wide association studies that found potential associations between single nucleotide point sequence variations and disease outcomes, many of which were not considered clinically robust by medical standards of the time. Furthermore, the information provided by DTC sources was often couched in terms of a percent increase in risk (eg, “40% more likely”) without providing additional details about the background risk that served as the basis for the estimate. Medical professionals viewed such language as misleading, especially if the background risk is low (eg, <1%). Without the interpretive help of a health care professional, critics of DTC products maintained that consumers were at risk of misinterpreting genetic test results and making health decisions on inaccurate or incomplete information. Of particular concern was the potential for decreasing health vigilance and the cessation of preventive health behaviors.\n\n【65】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【66】Direct-to-consumer genetic testing: perceptions, problems, and policy responses.\n\n【67】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【68】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【69】Direct-to-consumer genetic testing: good, bad or benign?\n\n【70】Why should customers exercise or follow a good diet if genetic testing says they are not at risk for cancer? The absence of data on these potential harms made these and other objections to DTC products difficult to counter.\n\n【71】In addition, in making their estimates of background genetic risk, DTC companies were relying on large data sets generated from studies of specific populations. Critics argued that this approach was not sufficiently sensitive to the potential influence of ethnic and racial differences across human populations. Customers who are told they are “negative” for a disease-associated sequence variation validated in 1 population might be given a false sense of security if their genetic ancestry is quite different. Critics also voiced concerns about the potential for unnecessary, expensive, or time-consuming downstream medical testing.\n\n【72】Direct-to-consumer testing emerged within an ambiguous regulatory setting . Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA), which regulates procedural aspects of laboratories that process medical samples, the FDA is tasked with ensuring the safety and efficacy of medical tests and interventions. In addition, the Fair Trade Commission may have regulatory oversight to oversee public claims about regulated products. Historically, the FDA has declined to exercise its right to regulate laboratory-developed tests, an exemption that allowed the rapid development and dissemination of physician-ordered carrier tests for diseases such as cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease. Although that decision resulted in considerable public health benefits, it also meant that there were no clear regulatory mechanisms in place to assess the analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility of DTC tests.\n\n【73】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【74】Taking responsibility: regulations and protections in direct-to-consumer genetic testing.\n\n【75】Figure Timeline for DTC 1.0 to 2.0. DTC = direct-to-consumer; DTC 1.0 = direct-to-consumer testing 1.0; DTC 2.0 = direct-to-consumer testing 2.0; FDA = Food and Drug Administration; GAO = US Government Accountability Office.\n\n【76】Although some DTC products included potentially sensitive health information, such as autosomal dominant disease risks, procedures in place to ensure informed consent were poor. These services were framed as a commercial transaction, not as a medical test, making it possible to order a saliva kit and submit a DNA sample without the need to provide the equivalent of “informed consent” to a medical genetic test. Although a user agreement form may have been included as an element of a DTC product, this form often related to future uses of genetic information, not to the testing process itself. Direct-to-consumer critics worried that consumers may not fully understand the health implications of the information they received.\n\n【77】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【78】Direct to consumer genetic testing: a systematic review of position statements, policies and recommendations.\n\n【79】Furthermore, buried in these user agreement forms were provisions that allowed DTC companies to retain and use customer data with impunity. This meant that companies could sell aggregate data to third parties or use consumer's data for research without their awareness. These concerns were partially born out when 23andMe filed a patent request in 2012, and several users protested that they had no knowledge that 23andMe intended to profit from their genetic information.\n\n【80】In 2006, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) launched an investigation into the practices of DTC genetic testing companies.\n\n【81】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【82】Direct-to-consumer genetic tests: misleading test results are further complicated by deceptive marketing and other questionable practices: Congressional testimony.\n\n【83】The GAO sent identical DNA samples to 4 companies and compared the results with the help of genetics experts. They also called representatives of each company, posing as a potential customer, to ask about company policies. In their report, published in 2010 and titled “Direct-to-consumer genetic tests: misleading test results are further complicated by deceptive marketing and other questionable practices,” the GAO wrote that “\\[our\\] fictitious consumers received test results that are misleading and of little or no practical use” and found “10 egregious examples of deceptive marketing.” The GAO report argued that advertising claims such as “let your DNA help you plan for the important things in life. Take charge of your health and wellness today” overstated the value of DTC test products and their potential to improve personal health.\n\n【84】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【85】23andMe and the FDA.\n\n【86】In response, the FDA sent letters to the 4 largest DTC testing companies on June 10, 2010, informing them that their products constituted medical devices that had not been submitted to the FDA for approval. On July 22 of that year, the House Committee on Commerce and Energy convened a hearing on DTC testing. In his opening statement, Representative Henry A. Waxman stated that government scrutiny was necessary to “ensure the public is protected against exaggerated claims, abusive marketing, and practices that threaten individual health and safety.” In November 2013, the FDA went a step further and sent “cease and desist” letters to several DTC genetic testing companies, ordering them to immediately discontinue marketing and sales of their health-related testing services until they received FDA authorization for these devices.\n\n【87】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【88】Regulation: the FDA is overcautious on consumer genomics.\n\n【89】Direct-to-Consumer Testing 2.0\n------------------------------\n\n【90】The FDA's shutdown of DTC genetic testing companies was seen as a victory for those who believed this type of testing posed a risk to consumers. More sympathetic commentators argued that the FDA was being overly cautious and stifling innovation.\n\n【91】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【92】Effect of direct-to-consumer genetic tests on health behaviour and anxiety: a survey of consumers and potential consumers.\n\n【93】To address the issue, analysts and researchers sought empirical evidence about the effect of DTC testing. A 2011 study conducted by the Scripps Research Institute surveyed individuals before and after accessing a DTC testing product and found “no significant differences in the level of anxiety, dietary fat intake, or exercise behavior between baseline and follow-up for the sample as a whole.” A subsequent study in 2013 found that only 24.6% of DTC customers reported any change in levels of anxiety after testing, and 85.3% of those claimed that their anxiety was reduced.\n\n【94】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【95】Direct-to-consumer testing: if consumers are not anxious, why are policymakers?\n\n【96】Although concerns about the analytical and clinical validity of DTC genetic tests remained, it appeared that objections to DTC testing based on concerns about consumer anxiety or negative changes in health behavior may have been exaggerated. Reflecting this perspective, Timothy Caulfield published an article in _Human Genetics_ titled “Direct-to-consumer testing: if consumers are not anxious, why are policymakers?”\n\n【97】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【98】Direct-to-consumer testing: if consumers are not anxious, why are policymakers?\n\n【99】Armed with these new data, and motivated by a continuing belief in the potential of personal genomics, industry actors began redefining DTC testing. In 2015, after conducting validation studies, 23andMe received device approval from the FDA for its carrier screen for hereditary Bloom syndrome, making it the first major company to embrace the DTC 2.0 model.\n\n【100】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【101】US Food and Drug Administration  \nFDA permits marketing of first direct-to-consumer genetic carrier test for Bloom syndrome.\n\n【102】As part of its premarket submission, 23andMe conducted not only extensive analytical validation of its test but also extensive user comprehension research. In its approval, the FDA confirmed that the company had submitted evidence establishing that members of the public were capable of correctly interpreting the test report at a 90% comprehension level (although these results were not published in the academic literature).\n\n【103】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【104】US Food and Drug Administration  \nEvaluation of automatic class III designation for the 23andMe Personal Genome Service carrier screening test for Bloom syndrome.\n\n【105】At the same time, the FDA announced that it would classify DTC genetic carrier screens as lower-risk devices, opening the way to testing for additional autosomal recessive conditions in the future. In doing so, the FDA signaled its willingness to consider at least some forms of DTC medical testing under the regulations. Encouraged, mainstream molecular diagnostic companies began to reenter the DTC space. In 2015, Illumina, one of the largest providers of genomic sequencing in the United States, announced its DTC testing spin-off, Helix. The premise of Helix is a “sequence-once-query-often” model that stores genomic information in a central database and allows business partners to develop DTC testing strategies that interrogate portions of these genomic data sets for its customers.\n\n【106】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【107】Illumina  \nIllumina, Warburg Pincus, and Sutter Hill ventures form Helix to accelerate consumer adoption of genomics.\n\n【108】Color Genomics, which focuses on the BRCA gene test, experimented with a test delivery model in which a physician working for Color Genomics would order genetic testing at the request of a consumer, with genetic counseling provided at no extra charge.\n\n【109】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【110】Early Twitter vets launch Color Genomics to make genetic screenings for breast cancer affordable.\n\n【111】Similarly, the carrier screening companies Good Start Genetics and Counsyl have their own consumer-facing websites and advertise directly to consumers but work closely with a network of affiliated clinical providers who order their tests. In 2015, Ancestry.com announced that it had begun talks with the FDA about offering a DTC test for disease risk. “We think it's totally appropriate that the FDA has stepped in to pretty aggressively regulate direct-to-consumer genetic tests,” said Tim Sullivan, Chief Executive Officer of Ancestry.com, “and we're just starting from that perspective, and trying to work very closely with them.”\n\n【112】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【113】Ancestry.com is talking to the FDA about using DNA to estimate people's risk of disease.\n\n【114】In April 2017, the FDA announced that after a successful premarket approval process, it had approved the marketing of the first DTC test for genetic health risk (GHR), 23andMe's Personal Genome Service, which tests for 10 diseases or conditions, including Alzheimer risk, Parkinson disease, and hereditary thrombophilia.\n\n【115】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【116】US Food and Drug Administration  \nFDA allows marketing of first direct-to-consumer tests that provide genetic risk information for certain conditions.\n\n【117】It also announced that tests for additional conditions would be exempt from premarket review, provided that those tests meet the requirements of the new GHR category. Notably, the FDA declared that the new GHR classification would not apply to diagnostic tests, which they defined as “tests \\[that\\] are often used as the sole basis for major treatment decisions.”\n\n【118】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【119】US Food and Drug Administration  \nReview Memorandum: 23andMe Personal Genome Service (PGS) test.\n\n【120】The FDA statement also singled out DTC tests for cancer, prenatal tests, and pharmacogenetic panels, adding that such tests would require separate regulatory review.\n\n【121】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【122】US Food and Drug Administration  \nReview Memorandum: 23andMe Personal Genome Service (PGS) test.\n\n【123】In issuing this guidance, the FDA signaled a regulatory approach that seeks to allow direct consumer access to some types of health-related genetic information while maintaining stricter regulatory oversight over what it considers to be diagnostic and other more clearly medical results.\n\n【124】These emerging models of DTC genetic testing attempt to strike a balance between the need to ensure consumer safety and the knowledge that personal genomic information is both highly desirable and potentially beneficial to some consumers. Although the exact form and features of DTC 2.0 are still evolving, some important contrasts with DTC 1.0 are clear. The FDA's standards for the quality of scientific evidence as the basis for offering tests and an emphasis on _outcomes_ of the tests as key considerations in determining their acceptability are perhaps most characteristic of DTC 2.0. The requirement to exhibit user comprehension signals that DTC 2.0 products will be expected to place greater emphasis on customer education and that genetic information will be considered in the broader context of health, environment, and behaviors. Direct-to-consumer testing 2.0 also calls for greater separation between testing for health information and “infotainment.” Although DTC 1.0 companies rejected the protectionist medical model, DTC 2.0 companies will have to embrace a hybrid approach in which modified protectionist strategies are used in partnership with licensed medical professionals .\n\n【125】Table 2 Key Points of Comparison Between DTC 1.0 and 2.0\n\n| DTC 1.0 | DTC 2.0 |\n| --- | --- |\n| No FDA involvement | FDA exercises regulatory discretion |\n| No medical integration | Increasing medical integration |\n| No analytical validation required | Analytical validation required |\n| No restrictions on panel content | Panel content regulated by risk level |\n| No comprehension validation required | User comprehension validation required |\n| All results integrated | Greater separation between health and entertainment |\n\n【127】DTC 1.0 = direct-to-consumer testing 1.0; DTC 2.0 = direct-to-consumer testing 2.0; FDA = Food and Drug Administration.\n\n【128】Supporters of this emerging paradigm point to the possibility of identifying presymptomatic diseases in the general population and individuals who might benefit from early medical intervention. In contrast, these early warning signs are useful only if they are founded on robust clinical evaluation platforms, necessitating clinical validation and oversight from both CLIA and the FDA. By virtue of exercising its regulatory privilege, the FDA has announced that the freedom of the individual to access any genetic tests he or she desires has its limits—at least until the test in question reaches minimal quality standards. The FDA's actions suggest that it is considering DTC tests under a broader definition of “medical device” that helps to clarify the pertinent regulatory consideration involved. In addition, all the major DTC 2.0 actors have taken for granted the necessity to conduct DTC tests in a laboratory that is certified under CLIA so as to ensure safe and accurate laboratory practices. Although the FDA considered 23andMe's premarket application under a de novo status, arguing that the device had no regulatory precedent, the regulatory expectations for other DTC products are clearer after this initial approval. The entire DTC test pipeline—from purchase to online receipt of results—is arguably 1 “device” under the emerging regulatory framework.\n\n【129】The acknowledgment that the product being packaged and sold is medical information, and thus subject to FDA regulation, is perhaps the biggest shift in DTC 2.0 thinking. Diagnostic health information carries its own weight of responsibility, not to mention regulatory restrictions under the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act. Nonetheless, it is not yet clear what ethical or legal responsibilities DTC companies may have to ensure that medical results are not only communicated to customers but are understood and acted on appropriately. It seems clear that the emerging regulatory system will need to develop a hybrid strategy that includes some aspects of the responsibility of medical information providers to ensure the quality of their information, their responsibility to facilitate user comprehension and interpretation of test results, the freedom of consumers to order testing on their own initiative, and the expectation that data will be managed appropriately.\n\n【130】One might speculate on several promising strategies to align the interests of the DTC market and the practice of medicine: improving pretest education to facilitate the kind of informed consent we would expect in a medical setting; separating consent to receive testing by purchasing a product from agreeing to the storage, use, or sale of samples for research; and providing clearer pathways into the medical system in the event of high-risk results by partnering with licensed medical providers to ensure information integrity. It is likely that FDA approval will facilitate the acceptance of DTC 2.0 tests by health insurance payers but a collaborative approach by all stakeholders would facilitate the process considerably. Finally, it will be essential to provide a supportive environment for consumers that acknowledges both the entertaining and potentially worrisome nature of genetic information and provides for counseling and follow-up.\n\n【131】An area of evolving compromise is the relationship between providers, consumers, patients, and medical health information generators. In their representations in the past, DTC testing companies have framed themselves as service providers with no relationship with their consumers beyond a commercial one. Several DTC companies encourage their customers to engage with online social media platforms and respond to follow-up surveys and health reports. This is an entirely voluntary relationship, with no obligations to either side. Even when customer samples are placed in a proprietary database and used for commercial purposes, there is no reciprocal obligation to customers to report on, or share in, the benefits of those programs. It seems clear, however, that one of the most cogent critiques of earlier DTC models was this attempt to flatten this relationship to a purely commercial purchase.\n\n【132】There is, however, precedent for offering information _relevant to health behaviors_ in a DTC digital platform. Numerous websites offer screening for obesity using self-reported body mass index statistics, and several websites or software services will allow individuals to construct a pedigree that may indicate a family history of inherited disease. Neither service constitutes diagnostic medical information, and the only existing framework for the discovery, return, and follow-up of diagnostic medical genetic information is the medical model. Thus, it remains to be seen how DTC 2.0 may evolve into a new model of health care interaction.\n\n【133】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【134】As evidenced by the timeline shown in the Figure , the realm of genetic testing and consumer health is evolving at a lightning pace. The combination of intense commercial competition, high consumer interest, and large-scale research on the effect of genetics on human health has combined to form an intense and rapidly shifting landscape. The evolution from DTC 1.0 to DTC 2.0 is characterized by an end to the clear division between medical and DTC models and the emergence of a hybrid approach that seeks to allocate forms of genetic information to one category or the other. The approach is in its early stages, and it remains unclear how successful the DTC 2.0 model will be in the marketplace or in public health settings. Nevertheless, it is clear that genetic information is increasingly moving out of medical institutions and into the private commercial sector. If they succeed, DTC 2.0 companies may usher in new collaborations between patients, consumers, medical providers, and regulators that maximize the benefits of genetic information through the empowerment of patients and providers.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Both guidelines focus on reducing cardiovascular risk, but they follow different approaches in terms of methods of risk estimation, definitions of at-risk groups, and treatment goals to achieve this common underlying objective. Both recommend achieving risk-based percentage reductions of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels with statin therapy. The ESC/EAS guidelines additionally recommend target LDL-C levels and are more liberal in supporting the use of both statin and nonstatin therapies across broader patient groups. The AHA/ACC guidelines may be considered more conservative, reserving the addition of nonstatins to maximally tolerated statins for only select patient groups based on specific LDL-C thresholds. One of the main reasons for these differences is incorporation of cost value considerations by the AHA/ACC guidelines, whereas the ESC/EAS guidelines consider an ideal setting with unlimited resources while making recommendations. In this review, we discuss similarities and differences between the 2 lipid guidelines to help clinicians become more cognizant of these recommendations and provide the best individualized patient care.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ABI ( ankle-brachial index ), AHA/ACC ( American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety ), apoB ( apolipoprotein B ), ARIC ( Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities ), ASCVD ( atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ), CAC ( coronary artery calcium ), CARDIA ( Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ), CHS ( Cardiovascular Health Study ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), CRP ( C-reactive protein ), CT ( computed tomography ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), DM ( diabetes mellitus ), eGFR ( estimated glomerular filtration rate ), ESC/EAS ( European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society ), FH ( familial hypercholesterolemia ), FOURIER ( Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk ), FRS ( Framingham Risk Score ), HDL-C ( high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), hsCRP ( high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ), IMPROVE-IT ( Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial ), LDL-C ( low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), LP(a) ( lipoprotein(a) ), LVH ( left ventricular hypertrophy ), NAFLD ( nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ), OSA ( obstructive sleep apnea ), PCE ( pooled cohorts equations ), PCSK9i ( proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor ), PUFA ( polyunsaturated fatty acid ), RCT ( randomized controlled trial ), REDUCE-IT ( Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial ), SBP ( systolic blood pressure ), SCORE ( Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation ), TC ( total cholesterol ), TG ( triglyceride )\n\n【4】**Article Highlights**\n\n【5】*   •\n\n【6】    The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety (AHA/ACC) guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) guidelines for lipid management, published less than a year apart, are conceptually similar but do have multiple areas of differences.\n\n【7】*   •\n\n【8】    The ESC/EAS guidelines assume an ideal setting with unlimited resources and provide more liberal recommendations for the use of newer therapies such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9is).

We also review the evidence base used in the recommendations for risk assessment, therapeutic goals, and interventions by both guideline committees.\n\n【35】Risk Assessment\n---------------\n\n【36】The assessment of ASCVD risk is an important central concept in both guideline documents because the recommended intensity of lipid-modifying treatment is based on the patient’s absolute risk. However, there are differences on how risk is estimated and defined in the respective guidelines, as described in Table 1 .\n\n【37】Table 1 Characteristics, Similarities, and Dissimilarities Between the Risk Assessment Tools Recommended by the ESC/EAS Guidelines (SCORE) and the AHA/ACC Guidelines (Pooled Cohort Equations)\n\n| Characteristic | SCORE | Pooled cohort equations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Outcome | 10-year risk of ASCVD mortality | 10-y risk of hard ASCVD events |\n| Year of introduction and rationale | 2003 by the SCORE project group in liaison with the Third Joint Task Force | 2013 by the Risk Assessment Work Group in conjunction with the Cholesterol Treatment Panel |\n| Year of introduction and rationale | Has since been recalibrated to include country-specific risks | To overcome limitations of the FRS because Framingham was derived mainly from the white population and is not representative of general US population, and to include first hard ASCVD event in risk estimation rather than coronary heart disease alone |\n| Year of introduction and rationale | To overcome limitations of the FRS because Framingham may not be applicable to the European population |  |\n| Population cohorts used for derivation | Based on 12 European cohorts including 205,178 individuals | Derived from ARIC, CARDIA, CHS, and Framingham original and offspring studies (total population ∼25,000) |\n| Year of baseline examination in derivation cohorts | 1967-1991 | ARIC (1987) |\n| Year of baseline examination in derivation cohorts |  | CARDIA (1985) |\n| Year of baseline examination in derivation cohorts |  | CHS (189-1999) |\n| Year of baseline examination in derivation cohorts |  | Framingham original study (1948) |\n| Year of baseline examination in derivation cohorts |  | Framingham offspring cohort (1971-1974) |\n| Variables included in the risk assessment tool | Age, sex, TC or TC/HDL-C ratio, SBP, smoking status | Age, sex, TC, HDL-C, diabetes, smoking, SBP, hypertensive treatment, race |\n| Strengths | Calibrated country-specific versions available for most European countries | Provides race-specific (whites and African Americans) and sex-specific risk estimations |\n| Strengths |  | Includes stroke risks |\n| Strengths |  | Includes nonfatal ASCVD outcomes |\n| Limitations | Derived from old cohorts | Derived from old cohorts |\n| Limitations | Patients with diabetes not included | May overestimate risks in certain cohorts and underestimate risks in others |\n| Limitations | Captures only risk of mortality but not of other CVD events that result in significant morbidity | Many ethnic populations are not represented |\n| Limitations | Overestimation of risk in older patients and underestimation of risk in younger patients |  |\n| Predicted events (fatal vs nonfatal) | Risk classification based on predicted risk of fatal events only | Predicts fatal and nonfatal events (including coronary death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and fatal or nonfatal stroke) |\n| Predicted events (fatal vs nonfatal) | The risk of total (fatal and nonfatal) events is ∼3 times higher than the fatal event, but this is not considered for making recommendations |  |\n| Thresholds | Very high risk ≥10% | High risk ≥20% |\n| Thresholds | High risk ≥5% to <10% | Intermediate risk ≥7.5% to <20% |\n| Thresholds | Moderate risk ≥1% to <5% | Borderline risk 5% to <7.5% |\n| Thresholds | Low risk <1% | Low risk<5% |\n\n【39】AHA/ACC = American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety; ARIC = Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities; ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CARDIA = Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults; CHS = Cardiovascular Health Study; CVD = cardiovascular disease; ESC/EAS = European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society; FRS = Framingham Risk Score; HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; PCE = pooled cohort equation; SBP = systolic blood pressure; SCORE = Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation; TC = total cholesterol.\n\n【40】### Risk Assessment Tools\n\n【41】For primary prevention, both guidelines recommend the estimation of 10-year ASCVD risk. Both guidelines endorse risk assessment tools derived from cohorts from specific geographic locations (the European population for Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation \\[SCORE\\], with country-specific recalibration, and the US-based cohorts for the PCE). However, risk classification by SCORE is based only on the risk of fatal events, whereas the PCE predicts risk of both fatal and nonfatal ASCVD events. The ESC/EAS argues that nonfatal events were not uniformly defined in the derivation cohorts (which are older) due to the use of nonuniform, noncontemporary definitions or diagnostic modalities, and, hence, only fatal events should optimally be used for risk estimation. In addition, recalibration for use in different countries, states, or ethnic groups is much more challenging with poorly defined nonfatal events than with mortality. This may explain why no attempt to date has been made to recalibrate PCEs. SCORE charts are provided for low- and high-risk European countries, and, in addition, the electronic version, HeartScore, provides recalibrated scores for many individual European countries. Some authors have called it a paradox of prevention guidelines that SCORE focuses on mortality only and not on the first ASCVD event (inclusive of nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke events), which should be the first goal of primary prevention.\n\n【42】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【43】Limitations of the SCORE-guided European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention.\n\n【44】Note that the process of updating SCORE has started. For the 2019 ESC/EAS lipid guidelines, the effect of age has been allowed to vary to reduce the overestimation of risk in older persons, the age range has been extended to 70 years, and the cholesterol band of 309 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) has been removed from SCORE because such patients will require treatment of their hyperlipidemia in all circumstances.\n\n【45】Both the PCE and SCORE risk estimation tools have well-described limitations. An ideal risk prediction tool would (1) be derived from a contemporary cohort of the population to which the risk prediction algorithm is to be applied, (2) predict risk of both fatal and nonfatal events using uniform definitions and contemporary diagnostic modalities, (3) be applicable to diverse ethnic populations, (4) reflect risk based on true natural history not altered by current lipid-lowering therapy, (5) be able to predict longer-term risk, and (6) include newer biomarkers where they improve the C statistic. Creating such an ideal risk prediction tool is a challenge in many countries, and given the inherent limitations of all risk prediction models, it is necessary to take a more holistic approach in individual risk evaluation. In a recent study by Mortensen and Nordestgaard,\n\n【46】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【47】the AHA/ACC risk prediction tool was better compared with SCORE in terms of effectiveness, measured using the number needed to treat as a surrogate. Using an observational cohort, they found that the AHA/ACC guidelines assigned statin therapy correctly to a larger number of patients to prevent 1 ASCVD event compared with the ESC/EAS guidelines. However, this study does not take into account that direct comparison of PCE and SCORE is limited because SCORE predicts only fatal events and the PCE predicts both fatal and nonfatal events.\n\n【48】To overcome some of these issues related to risk prediction tools, both guidelines recommend that 10-year ASCVD risk estimation is just the start of a risk-based assessment and discussion. Several risk enhancers or modifiers must then be taken into account for further risk refinement or reclassification.\n\n【49】### Risk Enhancers\n\n【50】Given the limitations of 10-year risk assessment, which can both overestimate and underestimate ASCVD risk,\n\n【51】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【52】Headed in the right direction but at risk for miscalculation: a critical appraisal of the 2013 ACC/AHA risk assessment guidelines.\n\n【53】both the guidelines provide risk-enhancing factors that, if present, would modify one’s risk upward and favor the initiation or intensification of statin therapy. These factors are described in Table 2 . The use of these risk-enhancing factors is mainly beneficial in patients at borderline/intermediate risk by the PCE (AHA/ACC) or low/moderate risk (ESC/EAS) because they provide additional support for the use of statin therapy in patients who are not at high risk for ASCVD events.\n\n【54】Table 2 Risk Stratification, Treatment Goals/Targets, and Therapeutic Interventions\n\n【55】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【56】ABI = ankle-brachial index; AHA/ACC = American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety; apoB = apolipoprotein B; ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CAC = coronary artery calcium; CKD = chronic kidney disease; CRP = C-reactive protein; CT = computed tomography; CVD = cardiovascular disease; DM = diabetes mellitus; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; ESC/EAS = European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society; FH = familial hypercholesterolemia; HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; hs-CRP = high-sensitivity C-reactive protein; LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; Lp(a) = lipoprotein (a); LVH = left ventricular hypertrophy; NAFLD = nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, OSA = obstructive sleep apnea; PCE = pooled cohort equation; PCSK9i = proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor; PUFA = polyunsaturated fatty acid, REDUCE-IT = Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial; SCORE= Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation; TG = triglyceride.\n\n【57】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【58】SI conversion factors: To convert TG values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0113; to convert hs-CRP values to nmol/L, multiply by 9.524; to convert Lp(a) values to μmol/L, multiply by 0.0357; to convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259.\n\n| Variable | ESC/EAS 2019 approach | AHA/ACC 2018 approach |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Recommended age for screening for lipid disorders | Men >40 y | ≥2 y with a family history of early CVD (class IIa/B-NR) |\n|  | Women >50 y or postmenopausal | 9-11 y, and again at 17-21 y even without any risk factors or family history (class IIb/B-NR) |\n|  | Children with suspected FH | Children and adolescents (no age defined) with obesity or other metabolic risk factors (class IIa/C-LD) |\n|  |  | ≥20 y (class I/B-NR) |\n| Age ranges for which treatment recommendations are provided for primary prevention | 40-75 y | 20-75 y (baseline LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL) |\n|  | \\>75 y: recommendations for primary prevention much weaker (class IIb) | 30-75 y (for heterozygous FH) |\n|  |  | 40-75 y |\n|  |  | \\>75 y: recommendations for primary prevention much weaker (class IIb) |\n| Risk assessment | SCORE calculator | ASCVD risk calculator (PCE) |\n| Risk stratification cohorts | 1\\.

The extent of reclassification by CAC score is sufficient to provide confidence that borderline- or intermediate-risk individuals with CAC scores greater than 0 will have event rates that likely exceed statin benefit thresholds (ie, ≥7.5% in 10 years), favoring statin therapy, whereas those with CAC scores equal to 0 would be estimated to have event rates less than 7.5%, where deferral of statin therapy is reasonable if desired by the patient. This information can help guide shared decision making .\n\n【80】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【81】Ten-year association of coronary artery calcium with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).\n\n【82】The CAC score has been reported to be the most robust marker for ASCVD risk reclassification, superior to other markers, such as family history, ankle-brachial index, or high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level.\n\n【83】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【84】New aspects of the risk assessment guidelines: practical highlights, scientific evidence and future goals.

The CAC score directly reflects the burden of atherosclerosis disease.\n\n【95】The ESC/EAS guidelines also recommend CAC level as a risk modifier in individuals at low or moderate risk (class IIa) for primary prevention; however, there is no clear guidance regarding the deferral of statin therapy for a CAC score of 0. Whereas the AHA/ACC guidelines do not provide recommendations for incorporating carotid plaque in risk stratification, the ESC/EAS guidelines recommend arterial (carotid or femoral) plaque burden on ultrasonography as a risk modifier in individuals at low or moderate risk. The ankle-brachial index is also recommended as a risk enhancer by both guidelines.\n\n【96】In the AHA/ACC guidelines, therapy recommendations based on subclinical ASCVD detected by imaging are limited to CAC scores in primary prevention, whereas the ESC/EAS guidelines consider certain patients with subclinical ASCVD (eg, with asymptomatic moderate coronary stenosis >50%) to be very high risk, equivalent to patients with clinical ASCVD . Neither the AHA/ACC nor ESC/EAS guidelines provided specific guidance regarding management after the detection of CAC by nongated chest CT or for nonobstructive coronary artery disease by CT angiography, although presumably these patients would be treated similarly as those with CAC scores greater than 0. Whether these markers of subclinical ASCVD detected incidentally on imaging tests can be helpful to upgrade or downgrade risk to guide decisions for statin therapy, in the way that Agatston CAC score does, remains unclear. With widespread use of imaging studies such as CT of the chest for diagnostic and screening purposes, it seems desirable to include these results for further risk refinement, especially in the intermediate- or moderate-risk cohorts. Similarly, whether some other, less-validated markers of ASCVD, such as vascular calcification noted on CT of the abdomen/pelvis or lower extremities, or valvular calcification, or aortic plaques detected on echocardiography, can be useful for risk refinement remains uncertain as well.\n\n【97】### Risk Groups\n\n【98】Both the AHA/ACC and ESC/EAS guidelines recommend stratification of individuals into risk cohorts, some of which are further subdivided based on the presence or absence of risk enhancers or modifiers. A common underlying theme between both guidelines is that the recommended intensity of therapeutic intervention depends on the absolute risk of the patient. However, there are some key differences between the cohorts included in these risk groups. These risk groups are described in the Figure and Table 2 .\n\n【99】Figure Different approaches recommended by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety (AHA/ACC) guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) guidelines to achieve a common goal. <sup>a </sup> Patients aged 40 to 75 years with diabetes are recommended for at least moderate-intensity statin therapy, or high-intensity statin therapy if multiple atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors are present. <sup>b </sup> Patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia are recommended for high-intensity statin therapy. <sup>c </sup> Patients aged 40 to 75 years with borderline (5% to <7.5%) or intermediate (7.5% to <20%) 10-year ASCVD risk. <sup>d </sup> Consider risk-enhancing factors or coronary artery calcium score if measured. <sup>e </sup> Therapy applies to select patients . <sup>f </sup> Patients with documented ASCVD, certain patients with diabetes, severe chronic kidney disease, 10-year risk greater than 10% by Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE), or familial hyperlipidemia with ASCVD/major risk factor. LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (given in mg/dL; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259); PCE = pooled cohort equation; PCSK9i = proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor; Δ↓ = decrease from baseline.\n\n【100】One notable difference between the 2 sets of guidelines is how the very high-risk group, considered to benefit from the most aggressive lipid-lowering therapy, is defined. The ESC/EAS guidelines define this group more broadly and include patients with not only clinical ASCVD but also selected patients with subclinical obstructive ASCVD and some patients for primary prevention, including those with severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), certain patients with diabetes, and patients with an estimated risk by SCORE of 10% or greater. On the other hand, only patients with clinical ASCVD (classic secondary prevention) are included in this group by the AHA/ACC guidelines.\n\n【101】Therapeutic Goals\n-----------------\n\n【102】The primary aim of both guidelines is to lower ASCVD risk through lowering of the atherogenic lipid burden; however, each takes a slightly different approach to achieve this common goal. Both the guidelines recognize LDL-C level as the primary therapeutic target and acknowledge that for lowering cardiovascular risk, “lower is better” for LDL-C level, with proven therapies based on the results of IMPROVE-IT (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial),\n\n【103】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【104】Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes.\n\n【105】FOURIER (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk),\n\n【106】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【107】Evolocumab and clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease.\n\n【108】ODYSSEY OUTOMES,\n\n【109】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【110】Alirocumab and cardiovascular outcomes after acute coronary syndrome.\n\n【111】and Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ group meta-analysis.\n\n【112】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【113】Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ (CTT) Collaboration. Efficacy and safety of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol: a meta-analysis of data from 170 000 participants in 26 randomised trials.\n\n【114】Although the ESC/EAS guidelines center their recommendations around this principle, the AHA/ACC guidelines also take into consideration some other factors, such as the cost value of different therapies. Both guidelines recommend the specific percentage (≥50%) reduction of LDL-C level from baseline for high-risk patients. However, the ESC/EAS guidelines recommend achievement of both specific percentage reduction in LDL-C level from baseline and achievement of target absolute LDL-C levels based on risk groups. Unlike the ESC/EAS, the AHA/ACC guidelines do not provide absolute LDL-C treatment targets but rather suggest LDL-C thresholds above which the addition of nonstatin therapy to maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended for patients with clinical ASCVD or severe primary hypercholesterolemia.\n\n【115】Choosing a goal of either a percentage reduction of LDL-C level from baseline or reducing LDL-C level below a certain target remains a subject of debate, but they do seem complementary in some regards. A meta-analysis from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ group\n\n【116】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【117】Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ (CTT) Collaboration. Efficacy and safety of more intensive lowering of LDL cholesterol: a meta-analysis of data from 170 000 participants in 26 randomised trials.\n\n【118】found that for every 39-mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) reduction in LDL-C level there was a relative risk reduction of 21%, thereby implying that a goal of percentage reduction in LDL-C level may be more useful than choosing a particular target for LDL-C level, especially for patients who have an untreated baseline LDL-C level close to the target. On the other hand, this has been questioned by other studies that have found that the interindividual variation in the percentage LDL-C response to a given dose of statin is largely dependent on the pretreatment level, which may not always be known in every patient, and, therefore, calculating an accurate percentage reduction may not be possible; therefore, in this context an absolute LDL-C target would be more appropriate.\n\n【119】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【120】The previous 2013 AHA/ACC guidelines did not provide any recommendations either in favor or against treatment targets. Those older guidelines were entirely based on randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence, partly in response to a report from the Institute of Medicine.\n\n【121】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【122】2013 ACC/AHA guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults.\n\n【123】The rationale to abandon targets was based on the argument that these RCTs were not designed to evaluate the effect of dose-adjusted statin treatment to achieve a prespecified LDL-C target, and the treat-to-target approach might result in “underuse” of evidence-based statin therapy and “overuse” of nonstatin drugs that are not found to reduce ASCVD events in RCTs. However, since 2013, multiple new drugs, specifically, ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors (PCSK9is), and, most recently, icosapent ethyl, have been reported to provide robust risk reduction in several new RCTs. Hence, the argument that statins are the only RCT-proven drugs is no longer true, and, hence, the thresholds provided to add nonstatin therapies in 2018 AHA/ACC guidelines are essential.\n\n【124】On the other hand, although the ESC/EAS guidelines use the treat-to-target approach, these guidelines also recommend achieving a mandatory percentage reduction in LDL-C level, which obviates any concerns related to undertreatment with statins in patients who have pretreatment LDL-C levels close to the target. At the same time, the treat-to-target approach does seem complementary in situations in which pretreatment LDL-C level may not be known, and targets can be used to assess therapeutic goal.\n\n【125】### ESC/EAS Targets vs AHA/ACC Thresholds\n\n【126】Although LDL-C thresholds described in the AHA/ACC guidelines may seem like indirect targets, there are several key differences from the absolute targets defined in the ESC/EAS guidelines. First, recommended thresholds in the AHA/ACC guidelines are applicable only to the secondary prevention cohort and to certain patients with primary severe hypercholesterolemia. Second, there are no class I recommendations for these thresholds. These thresholds are graded as either class IIa or IIb. On the other hand, the ESC/EAS guidelines provide a target absolute LDL-C level for each of their 4 risk groups, with add-on nonstatin therapy recommended if needed to achieve target, and they are graded as class I.\n\n【127】Inevitably, the target-based approach of the ESC/EAS guidelines is likely to result in a more intensive use of nonstatin therapies for the primary prevention cohort because the ESC/EAS guidelines include a broad group of other patients, such as those with severe CKD, certain patients with diabetes, or SCORE of at least 10% in the very high-risk group. The recommended target in this group is an LDL-C level less than 55 mg/dL. Although aggressive use of nonstatin therapy is justified in patients with ASCVD, evidence of the efficacy of ezetimibe and PCSK9i therapy in high-risk primary prevention patients is limited.\n\n【128】Considering an average LDL-C reduction of approximately 50% achieved by high-intensity statins, some patients with a baseline LDL-C level greater than 110 mg/dL may require the addition of a second-line therapy to achieve an LDL-C target less than 55 mg/dL. Similarly, considering an average LDL-C reduction of approximately 65% with high-intensity statins + ezetimibe, certain patients with a baseline LDL-C level greater than 160 mg/dL may not achieve the target even with this combination and may require the addition of PCSK9i therapy (class IIb recommendation for the primary prevention cohort by the ESC/EAS guidelines). Only the SPIRE\n\n【129】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【130】Cardiovascular efficacy and safety of bococizumab in high-risk patients.\n\n【131】trial included patients with high-risk primary prevention cohorts; however, this trial was prematurely terminated due to development of neutralizing antibodies, and further development of this drug was stopped.\n\n【132】### Other Biomarker Targets\n\n【133】Other than LDL-C targets, the ESC/EAS also provides targets for certain other biomarkers, such as apolipoprotein B (apoB) and non–HDL-C . Evaluation of apoB and non–HDL-C levels is recommended in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes mellitus, obesity, or very low LDL-C levels. Also, apoB level is recommended as an alternative to LDL-C level as the primary therapeutic target and is preferred over non–HDL-C level in patients with these conditions (class I). Although no targets are provided, the ESC/EAS guidelines recommend measurement of lipoprotein(a) (Lp\\[a\\]) at least once in each adult person’s lifetime to identify those at very high lifetime risk (class IIa) because very high Lp(a) levels (>180 mg/dL \\[to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 0.0357\\]) may be helpful in further risk stratification of patients who are in the high-risk cohort, with a family history of ASCVD, or those at the border of risk categories based on their estimated risk. However, unlike the AHA/ACC guidelines, the ESC/EAS guidelines do not provide any recommendations for a moderate degree of elevation in Lp(a) levels. In the ESC/EAS guidelines, thresholds are provided based on triglyceride (TG) levels for additional therapies, such as icosapent ethyl (a highly purified form of eicosapentaenoic acid at 4 g daily) in high-risk or very high-risk patients with TG levels of 135 to 499 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0113) despite statin treatment.\n\n【134】On the other hand, the AHA/ACC guidelines provide a relative indication for measuring apoB levels in patients with TG levels of at least 200 mg/dL. A family history of ASCVD or a personal history of ASCVD not explained by major risk factors are provided as relative indications for measuring the Lp(a) level. In contrast to the ESC/EAS guidelines, the AHA/ACC guidelines consider apoB and Lp(a) levels only as risk enhancers and not as primary targets for diagnosis or intervention in any patient groups. The AHA/ACC guidelines consider nonfasting non–HDL-C as a reasonable initial screening test, as a risk enhancer (non–HDL-C level ≥100 mg/dL \\[to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259\\]), and also provide non–HDL-C–based thresholds to add PCSK9i therapy in patients receiving maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy. Thresholds based on TG levels greater than 1000 mg/dL are provided to add fibrates, after optimizing therapeutic lifestyle changes and statin therapy.\n\n【135】Therapeutic Interventions\n-------------------------\n\n【136】Both the guidelines share several similarities. For example, both strongly recommend lifestyle modifications, clinician-patient risk discussion, and shared decision making. However, differences begin to emerge when considering drug therapy recommendations.\n\n【137】### Statins\n\n【138】Both the guidelines recommend statin therapy as the first-line drug therapy. Use of low-intensity statin therapy is not recommended as an initial therapy for any groups (including patients ≥75 years old) that do not have any issues with statin intolerance. The evidence base for use of statin therapy is the most robust compared with any other drug interventions.\n\n【139】### Ezetimibe\n\n【140】Both guidelines recommend ezetimibe as the second-line therapy in patients who either are statin intolerant or do not achieve desired LDL-C lowering while taking maximally tolerated statin therapy. This recommendation is based mainly on the results of IMPROVE-IT.\n\n【141】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【142】Ezetimibe added to statin therapy after acute coronary syndromes.\n\n【143】A post hoc analysis from IMPROVE-IT found that patients at higher risk derived the most benefit from the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin, whereas in patients at relatively lower risk (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction secondary prevention score of 0-1), there was no significant difference in outcomes with the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin.\n\n【144】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【145】Atherothrombotic risk stratification and ezetimibe for secondary prevention.\n\n【146】Although the ESC/EAS guidelines mention this study, their grade of recommendation for adding ezetimibe as an add-on therapy is stronger (class I) compared with the AHA/ACC guidelines, which provide weaker recommendations, with most recommendations for adding ezetimibe being class IIa or IIb, depending on whether one is at very high risk classification or not. The only class I recommendation for adding ezetimibe is before considering the addition of PCSK9i therapy. Although the AHA/ACC guidelines acknowledge that most patients in the FOURIER\n\n【147】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【148】Evolocumab and clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease.\n\n【149】or ODYSSEY OUTCOMES\n\n【150】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【151】Alirocumab and cardiovascular outcomes after acute coronary syndrome.\n\n【152】trials were not taking ezetimibe before PCSK9i therapy, this recommendation is based on the lower cost of ezetimibe and the long-term data showing safety, efficacy, and tolerability.\n\n【153】### PCSK9 Inhibitors\n\n【154】The AHA/ACA guidelines do not provide any class I recommendations for the use of PCSK9i therapy. It is graded as class IIa (for patients with ASCVD at very high risk) or IIb (for patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) . For patients other than those with familial hypercholesterolemia, the AHA/ACC guidelines do not provide any recommendations for the use of PCSK9i therapy for primary prevention, whereas the ESC/EAS guidelines recommend PCSK9i therapy as an add-on for primary prevention (for those at very high risk) if LDL-C goals are not met (class IIb). The ESC/EAS guidelines also provide a class I recommendation for patients in the secondary prevention cohort or those with familial hypercholesterolemia.\n\n【155】Thus, the ESC/EAS guidelines are more liberal in recommending the use of PCSK9i therapy, whereas the AHA/ACC guidelines may be considered more conservative. Including certain patients with subclinical ASCVD (noted on imaging studies) in the secondary prevention cohort by the ESC/EAS is inevitably going to lead to increasing use of PCSK9i therapy for patients who were not originally included in either the FOURIER\n\n【156】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【157】Evolocumab and clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease.\n\n【158】or ODYSSEY OUTCOMES\n\n【159】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【160】Alirocumab and cardiovascular outcomes after acute coronary syndrome.\n\n【161】trials. These trials included only patients with clinical ASCVD.\n\n【162】The other key difference between the 2 guidelines for recommending PCSK9i therapy is cost considerations. The AHA/ACC guidelines provide value statements in the context of PCSK9i therapy recommendations. These value statements provide a concise overview of the cost of achieving quality-adjusted life-years by the newer therapies, such as PCSK9i (based on 2018 US prices). Low value for cost is also one of the reasons for the weaker grade of recommendations for PCSK9i therapy.\n\n【163】The ESC/EAS guidelines acknowledge that PCSK9i therapy is not cost-effective at current prices. However, the ESC/EAS guidelines do not make recommendations for PCSK9i use based on cost considerations because resources and disease risk vary from one country to another, and what may be cost-effective in one country may not be valid in another. Hence, these guidelines base their recommendations assuming ideal settings where resources are unlimited. The ESC/EAS guidelines suggest incorporation of these recommendations, taking account of local circumstances.\n\n【164】### Bile Acid Sequestrants\n\n【165】These drugs have a weaker grade of recommendations (class IIb) by both the guidelines. Although the AHA/ACC guidelines recommend them only for primary prevention cohorts that need additional LDL-C lowering and do not have hypertriglyceridemia; the ESC/EAS guidelines do not specify primary or secondary cohort for their use .\n\n【166】### Icosapent Ethyl\n\n【167】Based on the results of the recently published REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial),\n\n【168】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【169】Cardiovascular risk reduction with icosapent ethyl for hypertriglyceridemia.\n\n【170】icosapent ethyl is recommended by the ESC/EAS guidelines for patients (high- or very high-risk cohorts) with hypertriglyceridemia (TG level of 135-499 mg/dL) despite statin therapy (class IIa). The AHA/ACC guidelines do not provide any recommendations for icosapent ethyl because REDUCE-IT was published after the guidelines were published.\n\n【171】Special Patient Groups\n----------------------\n\n【172】Recommendations for special patient groups are described in Table 3 , and a few of these groups are summarized herein.\n\n【173】Table 3 Special Patient Groups\n\n【174】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【175】AHA/ACC = American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety; ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CAC = coronary artery calcium; DM = diabetes mellitus; ESC/EAS = European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society; FH = familial hypercholesterolemia; LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\n\n| Group | ESC/EAS 2019 approach | AHA/ACC 2018 approach |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Women | Avoid lipid-lowering drugs when pregnancy is planned or during pregnancy and breastfeeding | Stop statin therapy 1-2 mo before contemplating pregnancy (class I/C-LD) |\n| Women | For severe FH patients, bile acid sequestrants or LDL-C apheresis may be considered |  |\n| Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction | Initiation of lipid-lowering therapy not recommended in patients with heart failure without other indications for their use (class III/A) | Consider moderate-intensity statins in patients with heart failure (ischemic etiology) if reasonable life expectancy (3-5 y) (class IIb/B-R) |\n| Age 20-39 y | No recommendations provided | Initiate statins (no guidance provided regarding intensity of statin therapy) in patients with DMbLong duration (≥10 years of DM type 1 or ≥20 years of DM type 2), albuminuria, eGFR less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2, ankle-brachial index less than 0.9, retinopathy, neuropathy.(class IIB/C-LD) |\n| Age ≥75 y | Secondary prevention: same recommendations as for younger patients | Secondary prevention: |\n| Age ≥75 y | Primary prevention: statins for patients at high or very high risk (class IIb/B) | Moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy reasonablecAfter evaluation for risk reduction, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions.(class IIa/B-NR) |\n| Age ≥75 y |  | Primary prevention: |\n| Age ≥75 y |  | Consider starting statins if: |\n| Age ≥75 y |  | DM (class IIb/C-LD) |\n| Age ≥75 y |  | LDL-C 70-189 mg/dLdPatients aged 76 to 80 years with LDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg/dL: may consider measurement of CAC score to avoid statins in patients with CAC score of 0 (class IIb/B-R).(class IIb/B-R) |\n| Age ≥75 y |  | Consider stopping statins if: |\n| Age ≥75 y |  | Functional decline, multimorbidity, frailty, or reduced life expectancy (class IIb/B-R) |\n| Age ≥75 y |  | CAC testing can be considered if risk uncertainty for ages 76-80 y (class IIb) |\n| Patients with acute coronary syndrome | Start high-dose statins regardless of LDL-C levels | No separate recommendations provided |\n| Chronic kidney disease stage 3-5 | Statin or statin/ezetimibe for patients not undergoing dialysis (class I/A) | Moderate-intensity statin ± ezetimibe (class IIa/B-R) |\n| Chronic kidney disease stage 3-5 | Patients taking statins/ezetimibe initiating dialysis: consider continuing statins especially in ASCVD patients (class IIa/C) | Patients taking LDL-C–lowering therapy initiating dialysis: continue statin (class IIb) |\n| Chronic kidney disease stage 3-5 | Dialysis patients without ASCVD: statins not recommended (class III/A) |  |\n\n【177】a AHA/ACC = American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety; ASCVD = atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; CAC = coronary artery calcium; DM = diabetes mellitus; ESC/EAS = European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society; FH = familial hypercholesterolemia; LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.\n\n【178】b Long duration (≥10 years of DM type 1 or ≥20 years of DM type 2), albuminuria, eGFR less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> , ankle-brachial index less than 0.9, retinopathy, neuropathy.\n\n【179】c After evaluation for risk reduction, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions.\n\n【180】d Patients aged 76 to 80 years with LDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg/dL: may consider measurement of CAC score to avoid statins in patients with CAC score of 0 (class IIb/B-R).\n\n【181】### Recommendations for Therapeutic Interventions at Extremes of Age\n\n【182】Both guideline documents provide primary and secondary prevention recommendations mainly for adults aged 40 to 75 years and secondary prevention recommendations for patients older than 75 years. Recommendations for primary prevention (either to initiate or continue statin therapy) in older patients (>75 years) are much weaker (class IIb). Evidence of benefit of statins for primary prevention in older adults (>75 years) with statins is mostly indirect and conflicting.\n\n【183】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【184】Effect of statin treatment vs usual care on primary cardiovascular prevention among older adults: the ALLHAT-LLT Randomized Clinical Trial.\n\n【185】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【186】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【187】Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration  \nEfficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials.\n\n【188】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【189】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【190】Ezetimibe Lipid-Lowering Trial on Prevention of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in 75 or Older (EWTOPIA 75): a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【191】Ongoing primary prevention clinical trials will provide more insights in this age group.\n\n【192】The AHA/ACC guidelines do recommend statin therapy for younger adults who have a baseline LDL-C level of at least 190 mg/dL and those with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, but for other groups of adults younger than 40 years, no specific pharmacotherapy recommendations are provided by either guidelines. The AHA/ACC guidelines recommend consideration of lifetime (30-year) risk for adults aged 20 to 59 years to help encourage sustained lifestyle improvements\n\n【193】### Diabetes\n\n【194】In the AHA/ACC guidelines for primary prevention, patients who have diabetes are recommended for statin therapy without the need to calculate 10-year risk. Patients with diabetes are then further subdivided based on presence or absence of diabetes-specific risk-enhancing factors to guide intensity of statin therapy. In contrast, patients with diabetes are categorized into the top 3 of the 4 risk groups (very high, high, and moderate risk) by the ESC/EAS guidelines based on additional factors, such as the presence of end organ damage, other risk factors, or total duration of diabetes.\n\n【195】### Chronic Kidney Disease\n\n【196】The ESC/EAS guidelines include patients with CKD in the high- and very high-risk groups based on an estimated glomerular filtration rate cutoff value of 30 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ; below this cutoff point denotes very high risk, and 30 to 59 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> denotes high risk. On the other hand, the AHA/ACC guidelines consider presence of CKD only as a risk-enhancing factor. Both the guidelines provide a class III recommendation (ie, not recommended) for the initiation of statin therapy in patients who are undergoing dialysis treatment. However, for patients who are already receiving statin therapy who require initiation of dialysis therapy, recommendations for continuation of statin therapy are stronger in the ESC/EAS guidelines (class IIa) compared with in the AHA/ACC guidelines (class IIb).\n\n【197】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【198】Although the AHA/ACC guidelines and the ESC/EAS guidelines for lipid management agree regarding broad principles, they do have differences in various aspects of lipid management, although most of the available evidence reviewed by the guideline committees was identical. Although the ESC/EAS guidelines recommend more liberal use of newer therapies, the AHA/ACC guidelines follow a conservative approach. Dissimilarities between the guidelines may be due to limited evidence for some populations and arriving at different conclusions when evaluating the same evidence base. By comparing these 2 major society guidelines, we hope that this paper will help clinicians become more cognizant of the context of the US and European recommendations to help clinicians chose the best individualized care for their patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The study benefits from full capture of all referrals in Belgium to a center for evaluation of fitness to drive and car adaptations. From 2013 through 2014, more than 10,000 drivers were referred, of whom 6584 were studied in detail. The largest group of participants had neurologic conditions, which, unfortunately, do not seem to be represented in proportion to the population prevalence, probably because of referral biases to the center. For example, there were 1573 patients with stroke, 608 with multiple sclerosis, 292 with spinal cord injury, but only 79 with epilepsy. Yet, epilepsy is a major focus of driving restrictions in many countries.\n\n【4】The first study observation is perhaps not surprising, which is that the referring physician was much more likely to make a favorable driving recommendation than was a neutral party performing a comprehensive fitness-to-drive evaluation. For some categories of medical disorders, the discrepancy in recommending restrictions was 10-fold. This may take place because the referring physician may be more inclined to view herself or himself as a patient advocate. In addition, professional driving evaluators may be more aware of crash risks deriving from medical impairments. The second study observation was that neurologic impairments, although composing the largest referral category, generated considerably fewer adverse fitness-to-drive decisions or history of motor vehicle crashes in the past 5 years than did other categories, including psychiatric, cardiopulmonary, and substance abuse disorders.\n\n【5】The validity of driving evaluations depends, in part, on the nature of the medical disability. Intermittent disabilities, such as those producing seizures or episodes of hypersomnia, will not likely be present at the time of evaluation. This is in contrast to most neuromuscular disorders, strokes, or visual impairments. For intermittent disorders, fitness must largely be judged on history, and such histories are notoriously unreliable and subject to biases. With respect to epilepsy, there may be a tendency to equate risk of recurrent seizure with risk of a crash, but the relationship is not so simple. Many crashes in people with epilepsy are not due to seizures, and most seizures do not cause crashes. Nevertheless, when evaluating fitness for driving in people with epilepsy, the practicality of licensing requires a simple measure.

All the patients declined surgery or were poor surgical candidates. The TNs were benign on fine-needle aspiration, enlarging or causing compressive symptoms, and 3 cm or larger in largest diameter. We evaluated TN volume, compressive symptoms, cosmetic concerns, and thyroid function.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Median TN volume reduction induced by RFA was 44.6% (interquartile range \\[IQR\\], 42.1%-59.3%), from 24.2 mL (IQR, 17.7-42.5 mL) to 14.4 mL (IQR, 7.1-19.2 mL) ( _P_ <.001). Median follow-up was 8.6 months (IQR, 3.9-13.9 months). Maximum results were achieved by 6 months. Radiofrequency ablation did not affect thyroid function. In 1 patient with subclinical hyperthyroidism due to toxic adenoma, thyroid function normalized 4 months after ablation of the toxic nodule. Compressive symptoms resolved in 8 of 12 patients (67%) and improved in the other 4 (33%). Cosmetic concerns improved in all 8 patients. The procedure had no sustained complications.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In this population, RFA of benign large TNs performed similarly to the reports from Europe and Asia. It induces a substantial volume reduction of predominantly solid TNs, improves compressive symptoms and cosmetic concerns, and does not affect normal thyroid function. Radiofrequency ablation has an acceptable safety profile and should be considered as a low-risk alternative to conventional treatment of symptomatic benign TNs.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CFD ( color flow Doppler ), IQR ( interquartile range ), RFA ( radiofrequency ablation ), SYS ( symptom score ), TN ( thyroid nodule )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

In most cases, these two rates are comparable. However, in some cancer types for which cancer screening is performed, relative survival is often greater than disease-specific survival. This divergence has been attributed to mechanisms such as the “healthy user effect” and overdiagnosis of indolent tumors detected by screening. Using relative survival rate as a marker of these mechanisms, we examined the association of breast cancer screening with relative survival rates for women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. In population-based data from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registry, we examined relative survival rates in women diagnosed with stage I breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ who were in highly screened vs less-highly screened groups, based on time period, age group, and insurance status. In this analysis, relative survival rates for early-stage breast cancer were higher than disease-specific survival, even exceeding 100% in populations experiencing higher rates of screening (ie, women diagnosed during the era of widespread uptake of mammography, age older than 40 years, and women with health insurance coverage). The favorable outcomes observed in screen-detected breast cancers are at least in part attributable to the healthy user effect and overdiagnosis of indolent tumors. Therefore, survival rates may not accurately reflect the effectiveness of cancer screening. These findings have implications for counseling of patients and future clinical studies of active monitoring approaches in breast cancer.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】DCIS ( ductal carcinoma in situ ), SEER ( Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

After 7.0 years (mortality) and 6.2 years (disease incidence) mean follow-up, there were 10,306 (2.7%) deaths, 24,388 (5.3%) CVD events, and 39,121 (8.7%) cancer events. Associations between TV time and all-cause and CVD mortality were curvilinear ( _P_ <sub>non-linear </sub> ≤.003), with lowest risk observed <2 hours per day. Theoretically, 8.64% (95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 6.60-10.73) of CVD mortality is attributable to TV time. Limiting TV time to 2 hours per day might have prevented, or at least delayed, 7.97% (95% CI, 5.54-10.70) of CVD deaths. Substituting TV time with sleeping, walking, or moderate or vigorous physical activity was associated with reduced risk for all outcomes when baseline levels of substitute activities were low.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】TV time is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. Future guidelines could suggest limiting TV time to less than 2 hours per day to reduce most of the associated adverse health events.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), NCD ( noncommunicable disease ), PAF ( population attributable fraction ), PIF ( potential impact fraction ), TV time ( television viewing time )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Its remarkable ability to acquire antibiotic resistance has contributed to its emergence as an important pathogen in a variety of settings. In the preantibiotic era, _S aureus_ infections were associated with very high mortality. When penicillin was first introduced in the early 1940s, much of its success was in the treatment of _S aureus_ bloodstream infections. However, as early as 1942 the first strains of penicillin-resistant _S aureus_ were detected in hospitals . These subsequently spread into the community; by 1960, most _S aureus_ strains both in hospitals and in the community were resistant to penicillin. Shortly after the introduction in 1959 of methicillin, a semisynthetic penicillin, resistance to it emerged; the first hospital outbreak of MRSA was reported in 1963.\n\n【17】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【18】Evolution of natural resistance to the newer penicillins.\n\n【19】Initially spreading widely in Europe, India, and Australia, MRSA strains were detected in the United States in the late 1960s.\n\n【20】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【21】Methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ at Boston City Hospital: bacteriologic and epidemiologic observations.\n\n【22】By the 1980s, MRSA had become firmly established in US hospitals, and rates of MRSA infection have since continued to increase. In large US hospitals, MRSA rates (the proportion of all _S aureus_ isolates that are MRSA) increased from 4% in the 1980s to 50% in the late 1990s. According to National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance data, the increase in MRSA rates in intensive care units was even greater, reaching 60% in 2003.\n\n【23】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【24】National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance (NNIS) System Report, data summary from January 1992 through June 2004, issued October 2004.\n\n【25】TABLE 1 Timeline of _Staphylococcus aureus_ Infection and Resistance\n\n| Year | Event |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1940 | Penicillin introduced |\n| 1942 | Penicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ appears |\n| 1959 | Methicillin introduced; most _S aureus_ strains in both hospital and community settings are penicillin resistant |\n| 1961 | Methicillin-resistant _S aureus_ appears |\n| 1963 | First hospital outbreak of methicillin-resistant _S aureus_ (MRSA) |\n| 1968 | First MRSA strain in US hospitals |\n| 1970s | Clonal spread of MRSA globally, very high MRSA rates in Europe |\n| 1982 | 4% MRSA rate in the United States |\n| 1980s, early 1990s | Dramatic decreases in MRSA rates due to search-and-destroy programs in Northern Europe |\n|  | By 1999, <1% MRSA rate in the Netherlands; that rate has been sustained to date despite increasing MRSA rates in other parts of the world |\n| 1996 | Vancomycin-resistant _S aureus_ (VRSA) reported in Japan |\n| 1997 | Approximately 25% MRSA rate in US hospitals; vancomycin use increases; vancomycin-intermediate _S aureus_ (VISA) appears; serious community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections reported; pediatric deaths reported |\n| 2002 | First clinical infection with VRSA in the United States |\n| 2003 | MRSA rates continue to increase; approximately 60% MRSA rate in intensive care units; outbreaks of CA-MRSA (predominantly USA 300 clone) reported in numerous community settings and also implicated in hospital outbreaks |\n| 2006 | \\>50% of staphylococcal skin infections seen in emergency departments caused by CA-MRSA |\n|  | HA-MRSA rate continues to increase |\n|  | Distinction between HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA on epidemiological basis becomes increasingly difficult |\n| 2007 | “The Year of MRSA?” |\n|  | Report of active, population-based surveillance for invasive MRSA done in 2004-2005 estimates 95,000 invasive MRSA infections and 19,000 deaths from MRSA per year |\n|  | Continued reports in the medical literature and the lay press about severe CA-MRSA infections |\n|  | Several states pass or are considering legislation regarding control of MRSA and public reporting of MRSA rates |\n|  | Strategies to control MRSA, including public reporting of MRSA infections, are hotly debated; “staph” and MRSA become household words |\n\n【27】Nosocomial MRSA is remarkable for its clonal pattern of spread. Currently, 5 major MRSA clones account for approximately 70% of MRSA isolates in hospitals in the United States, South America, and Europe. The major cause of this clonal spread is infection control lapses by health care professionals. The traditional risk factors for MRSA acquisition include previous hospitalization, antibiotic use, residence in long-term care facilities, and long-term hemodialysis. Increasing use of vancomycin to treat MRSA led to the emergence of _S aureus_ with intermediate resistance to vancomycin (VISA) and then vancomycin-resistant _S aureus_ (VRSA) in the 1990s.\n\n【28】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【29】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n【30】Update: _Staphylococcus aureus_ with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin—United States, 1997.\n\n【31】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【32】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【33】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n【34】_Staphylococcus aureus_ resistant to vancomycin—United States, 2002.\n\n【35】Fortunately, VISA and VRSA infections have been sporadic, and intense infection control measures have ensured that they did not circulate widely in health care settings.\n\n【36】In the early 1980s, several instances of community-onset MRSA were reported in the upper Midwest. Because many of these early cases involved intravenous drug users or people with serious underlying disease, it was thought that the infections were acquired during contact with health care personnel. However, in the 1990s serious MRSA infections were reported in patients with no prior contact with the health care system, heralding the onset of community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) outbreaks.

To summarize, HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA strains carry different types of the gene complex known as staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (SCC mec), which contains the mecA gene that confers methicillin resistance. Health care-acquired MRSAstrains carry SCC mec types I, II, and III and tend to be multidrug resistant. They typically cause bloodstream and postoperative wound infections along with nosocomial pneumonia in hospitalized patients.\n\n【71】In contrast, CA-MRSA strains carry SCC mec type IV and V and usually cause skin and soft tissue infections in community-dwelling children and adults. The most common clinical presentations are furuncles, superficial abscesses, and boils that are often mistakenly attributed to spider bites. Like HA-MRSA, CA-MRSA also spreads clonally, and the USA 300 clone is the predominant strain circulating in the United States.\n\n【72】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【73】Emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ USA 300 clone as the predominant cause of skin and soft-tissue infections.\n\n【74】Although resistant to methicillin and other β-lactam antibiotics (eg, penicillin, cephalosporins, carbapenems), CA-MRSA often remains sensitive to many other classes of antibiotics, including trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracyclines. Resistance to macrolides, clindamycin, and fluoroquinolones varies by region. In addition to skin infections, cases of severe necrotizing pneumonia (including postinfluenza pneumonia) and necrotizing fasciitis caused by CA-MRSA have been described.\n\n【75】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【76】*   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n\n【77】Severe methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ community-acquired pneumonia associated with influenza—Louisiana and Georgia, December 2006—January 2007.\n\n【78】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【79】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【80】Necrotizing fasciitis caused by community-associated methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ in Los Angeles.\n\n【81】Many cases of necrotizing pneumonia and some soft tissue infections have been characterized by rapid progression to septic shock and death.

A 2001-2002 population-based study in the United States showed that the prevalence of nasal colonization with _S aureus_ and with MRSA was 31.6% and 0.84%, respectively,\n\n【111】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【112】A US population-based survey of _Staphylococcus aureus_ colonization.\n\n【113】meaning that there are approximately 2.3 million MRSA-colonized people in the United States. Women, people older than 65 years, those with diabetes mellitus, or those who have been in long-term care in the preceding year are more likely to be colonized with MRSA. Two nasal _S aureus_ carriage patterns can be distinguished: persistent and intermittent. The density of _S aureus_ in the nose is highest in persistent carriers, as is its colonization of other body sites, including the hands, axillae, and perineal regions.\n\n【114】Although the relationship between colonization and infection is not completely understood, both are associated with intrinsic host factors, as well as the strain of _S aureus_ . Nasal colonization with _S aureus_ is a risk factor for subsequent infection. Both higher rates of _S aureus_ nasal carriage and subsequent higher rates of infection have been associated with many underlying diseases or conditions, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, long-term dialysis, intravenous drug abuse, repeated injections for allergies, liver cirrhosis, liver transplant, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and hospitalization. Also correlated with higher _S aureus_ infection rates are activities leading to skin lesions such as contact sports. The common factor between these conditions seems to be the repeated violation of the skin or mucosa as anatomical barriers.\n\n【115】Impact of MRSA\n--------------\n\n【116】Patients colonized with MRSA are more likely to develop infections than patients colonized with methicillin-sensitive _S aureus_ (MSSA).\n\n【117】<sup><a>33</a></sup>\n\n【118】Risk of methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ infection after previous infection or colonization.\n\n【119】Methicillin-resistant _S aureus_ infections lengthen hospital stays (by an average of 10 days) and are associated with a 2.5-fold higher mortality rate and increased health care costs.\n\n【120】<sup><a>34</a></sup>\n\n【121】Comparison of mortality risk associated with bacteremia due to methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible _Staphylococcus aureus_ .\n\n【122】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【123】<sup><a>35</a></sup>\n\n【124】Nosocomial methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteremia: is it any worse than nosocomial methicillin-sensitive _Staphylococcus aureus_ bacteremia?\n\n【125】A diagnosis of _S aureus_ infection accounts for an estimated 292,000 hospitalizations per year in the United States.\n\n【126】<sup><a>36</a></sup>\n\n【127】Methicillin-resistant- _Staphylococcus aureus_ hospitalizations, United States.\n\n【128】In 2005, approximately 94,000 persons were diagnosed as having invasive (ie, serious) MRSA infections, an estimated 19,000 of whom died.

It can survive on surfaces for days to weeks; hence, contaminated patient care equipment can play a role in transmission.\n\n【137】<sup><a>38</a></sup>\n\n【138】Risk of acquiring antibiotic-resistant bacteria from prior room occupants.\n\n【139】The factors that promote transmission of MRSA in community settings have been called the _5 Cs_ and are summarized in Table 2 . Although the strategies to control HA-MRSA and true CA-MRSA share many features, they differ in some respects. Rates of infection with both these organisms can be reduced by good antibiotic stewardship, which will prevent the selection of MRSA from among a population of _S aureus_ . Good hand hygiene practices will limit person-to-person transmission and decrease the pool of persons who are colonized. In health care settings, active surveillance cultures to identify patients with MRSA, contact precautions (use of gown and gloves while caring for these patients), and good environmental cleaning have been proposed as additional strategies to limit MRSA transmission\n\n【140】<sup><a>39</a></sup>\n\n【141】Guideline for isolation precautions: preventing transmission of infectious agents in healthcare settings 2007.\n\n【142】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【143】<sup><a>40</a></sup>\n\n【144】Management of multidrug-resistant organisms in healthcare settings, 2006.\n\n【145】In selected patients, decolonization could help reduce infection. However, widespread use of decolonization is not recommended because it is expensive, its benefit is usually short lived (most patients become recolonized during the next few months), and it carries the risk of promoting resistance to agents, such as mupirocin, that are used in decolonizing regimens.\n\n【146】TABLE 2 Factors Associated With Community-Acquired Methicillin-Resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ Transmission (The _5 Cs_ )\n\n| **_C_** rowded living conditionsFrequent skin-to-skin **_C_** ontact**_C_** ompromised skinSharing **_C_** ontaminated personal items such as towels and razorsLack of **_C_** leanliness |\n| --- |\n\n【148】In July 2004, Mayo Clinic Rochester expanded its MRSA control program. In addition to isolating patients known to be carriers of MRSA and electronically flagging their records so that isolation procedures could be reinstituted on readmission, staff members began to screen high-risk patients for MRSA and preemptively isolated them until negative culture results were obtained. In the 36 months after institution of this program, rates of MRSA rates decreased by 25% (ie, from 42% to 29% of _S aureus_ isolates) (unpublished data). Several Scandinavian countries have reduced MRSA infection rates to less than 2% through intensive infection control programs and have successfully maintained these low rates over the past several years.\n\n【149】<sup><a>41</a></sup>\n\n【150】Successful control of widespread methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ colonization and infection in a large teaching hospital in the Netherlands.\n\n【151】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【152】<sup><a>42</a></sup>\n\n【153】Successful search-and-destroy policy for methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ in The Netherlands \\[letter\\].\n\n【154】Physicians can help control the spread of CA-MRSA in communities by encouraging hand hygiene, maintaining a high degree of suspicion for MRSA as an etiologic agent when treating skin and soft tissue infections, knowing local rates of CA-MRSA (public health departments might be able to provide these data), emphasizing the importance of hygiene to patients with MRSA, and discouraging the sharing of personal items such as towels and razors. Draining lesions should be kept covered, and return to team sports should be limited until the lesion has healed or can be adequately covered. Flu shots (especially in children) could be helpful in reducing the risk of postinfluenza bacterial pneumonia with MRSA.\n\n【155】Treatment Options\n-----------------\n\n【156】Selection of initial antibiotic regimens should be guided by the local prevalence of MRSA, the presence of health care-associated risk factors, and the severity and type of clinical presentation. For severe infections, intravenous vancomycin should be included in initial empiric therapy. Microbiological data and antibiotic susceptibility testing should be used to guide subsequent therapy. First approved in 1958, vancomycin became standard therapy for MRSA in the 1960s. Its advantages include its good safety profile, the long experience with its use, and its relatively infrequent dosing regimen. Disadvantages include the need for intravenous administration and monitoring of levels in critically ill patients and in those with changing renal function. In addition, the molecule is large, limiting its penetration into tissues. Recently, there have been reports of vancomycin failure due to either relative vancomycin resistance or MRSA infections in sites that have poor vancomycin penetration.\n\n【157】<sup><a>43</a></sup>\n\n【158】Microbiological features of vancomycin in the 21st century: minimum inhibitory concentration creep, bactericidal/static activity, and applied breakpoints to predict clinical outcomes or detect resistant strains.\n\n【159】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【160】<sup><a>44</a></sup>\n\n【161】Increased vancomycin MICs for _Staphylococcus aureus_ clinical isolates from a university hospital during a 5-year period.\n\n【162】Overall, vancomycin remains standard treatment for MRSA; however, some alternatives have recently received Food and Drug Administration approval and could be good options in selected patients, including linezolid (a synthetic oxazolidinone), tigecycline (a derivative of minocycline), and daptomycin (a cyclic lipopeptide). Daptomycin should be avoided in the treatment of MRSA-associated pneumonia because it is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant. Additional agents that appear promising include dalbavancin, a semisynthetic lipoglycopeptide that can be dosed once a week, and ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin.\n\n【163】For soft tissue CA-MRSA infections, surgical drainage is crucial, with antibiotics serving as adjunctive therapy. Severe infections should be managed with intravenous antibiotics as aforementioned. Oral antibiotics can be used for less severe infections in the outpatient setting. For initial empiric therapy, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is a good choice. Other alternatives include minocycline, clindamycin, or a macrolide antibiotic, depending on local susceptibility patterns.\n\n【164】In summary, MRSA is a growing public health problem. Initially, it was feared that HA-MRSA, long a cause of health care-associated infections, would escape into community settings. Instead, in the past few years, CA-MRSA strains that are genetically different from HA-MRSA have appeared, are now circulating widely in many communities, and are causing a wide variety of infections, ranging from minor skin infections to rapidly progressive, life-threatening ones. Ironically, these more virulent CA-MRSA strains have been imported from the community into health care settings and have been responsible for outbreaks of infections in hospitals. Infection control measures have been successful in limiting the spread of MRSA in many parts of the world, and most hospitals in the United States are increasing MRSA control activities to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n\n【165】Currently, the health care industry is under increasing scrutiny by both the public and governmental agencies. Medicare and other groups have threatened not to reimburse for hospital-acquired infections. Legislation is being considered or has already been passed in some states mandating the reporting of health care-acquired infection rates and separate reporting of MRSA rates. The spread of MRSA and other drug-resistant organisms can be limited by infection control measures. It is time that we, as health care professionals, incorporate proven infection control measures such as hand hygiene and the use of appropriate personal protective equipment (gowns and gloves) into our daily patient care routines. The next influenza pandemic might or might not happen in our lifetime.

The widespread implementation of electronic health records has changed the way in which physicians work and made it more difficult for physicians to disconnect from work.\n\n【40】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【41】Allocation of Physician Time in Ambulatory Practice: A Time and Motion Study in 4 Specialties.\n\n【42】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【43】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【44】Tethered to the EHR: primary care physician workload assessment using EHR event log data and time-motion observations.\n\n【45】Increased time spent interacting with the electronic health records rather than colleagues has also created a sense of isolation among many physicians that has insidiously eroded the sense of community, connection, and support from colleagues traditionally characteristic of the profession.\n\n【46】Pressure to contain cost and increase access has led many organizations to focus on productivity (eg, volume of clinical services provided) and financially driven performance metrics that can become incongruent with the altruistic values and human-human interactions that attracted many physicians to medicine. The high prevalence of occupational distress among physicians and the complex contributing factors warrant a comprehensive solution.\n\n【47】A Population Health Approach to Promote Well-Being for Physicians\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【48】A population health approach addresses the factors that influence health, assesses patterns of their occurrence, and applies results to develop and implement strategies to improve the health and well-being of the population. A comprehensive population mental-health approach includes universal prevention strategies for the entire population, selective prevention strategies delivered to individuals at higher than average risk of illness, indicated prevention strategies targeting individuals with mild symptoms of mental illness that do not meet diagnostic criteria, and treatment for individuals who do meet diagnostic criteria for mental illness.\n\n【49】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【50】Institute of Medicine report on prevention of mental disorders.

Although the literature has primarily evaluated physician well-being using metrics of distress,\n\n【61】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【62】What Do We Mean by Physician Wellness? A Systematic Review of Its Definition and Measurement.\n\n【63】a comprehensive approach for physician health combines strategies to promote well-being measurable in positive terms along with strategies to prevent distress, illness, and death. One occupational indicator of well-being measured in positive terms is professional fulfillment, which is associated with both avoidance of burnout and higher quality of life in physicians.\n\n【64】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【65】A brief instrument to assess both burnout and professional fulfillment in physicians: reliability and validity, including correlation with self-reported medical errors, in a sample of resident and practicing physicians.\n\n【66】Organizational efforts to promote professional fulfillment must address culture and climate variables such as supportive leadership, psychological safety, appreciation, professionalism, and mission alignment. One best-practice strategy to improve these factors is providing leaders with feedback derived from evaluations by those they lead, using standardized assessment of leadership behaviors that promote professional fulfillment.\n\n【67】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【68】Impact of organizational leadership on physician burnout and satisfaction.\n\n【69】Regular feedback coupled with training and leadership coaching where indicated will help leaders shape the culture of their organizations.

Universal strategies target all physicians in the group (eg, scribes for all primary care doctors), not just those with — or at high risk for — burnout. Organizational-level strategies target factors such as work-flow efficiency, improved teamwork, workplace communication, or community building. Specific organizational-level strategy examples in primary care include pre-visit lab tests, standardized annual renewal of long-term medications, and an expanded role for medical assistants to help with order entry and drafting the clinical encounter note.\n\n【77】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【78】In search of joy in practice: a report of 23 high-functioning primary care practices.\n\n【79】Selective prevention strategies target physicians at increased risk for burnout. An example of a selective burnout prevention strategy is providing longitudinal support to physicians who have been named in a malpractice case. Physicians are preferentially “selected” for this resourse allocation, whether or not they are experiencing significant burnout, because being named in a malpractice case is a risk factor for burnout.\n\n【80】Indicated interventions are typically more resource intensive and are reserved for the subset of physicians experiencing significant job-related distress (burnout). An example of an indicated intervention for burnout is individual professional coaching.\n\n【81】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【82】Effect of a professional coaching intervention on the well-being and distress of physicians: a pilot randomized clinical trial.\n\n【83】### Timely Treatment for Mental Illness\n\n【84】A population health approach must also facilitate timely intervention for individuals with clinically defined mental illness — which typically involves generalized rather than occupational-specific distress. Facilitating timely treatment includes efforts to mitigate stigma and other barriers to physicians seeking treatment, such as factors related to the licensing and credentialing process. High correlation between occupational burnout and symptoms of depression and anxiety\n\n【85】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【86】A brief instrument to assess both burnout and professional fulfillment in physicians: reliability and validity, including correlation with self-reported medical errors, in a sample of resident and practicing physicians.\n\n【87】suggest utility of screening for these conditions among physicians experiencing burnout. Screening results should facilitate access to mental health providers who are adept at addressing the unique needs of physicians, including the role of medical practice stressors that may precipitate or perpetuate mental illness. Flexibility in appointment scheduling and availability of video conferencing sessions may attenuate barriers that otherwise prevent physicians from accessing care.\n\n【88】Example of an Early-Adopter Population Health Approach\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【89】The state of California is creating precisely such a comprehensive, statewide population health approach to physician well-being for its 110,000 physicians. The Well Physician–California program, designed by the Stanford University WellMD Center and funded by the California Medical Association, includes the full spectrum of strategies in the population health framework .\n\n【90】Table Well-Physician California: A Population Health Approach to Promote Physician Well-Being\n\n| Intervention level | Initial planned strategies |\n| --- | --- |\n| Foster change in professional norms and culture | Advocacy for necessary regulatory and policy changes |\n|  | Improve the efficiency of the practice environment (eg, attenuate “prior authorization” burden). |\n|  | Reduce barriers to seeking help (eliminate medical board licensing policies that penalize physicians who seek care for mental health issues) |\n|  | Systematic engagement of organizations |\n|  | Assess level of burnout and professional well-being and provide state-level benchmarks |\n|  | Guide senior leaders in interpretation of assessment results and a framework for action |\n|  | Engage physicians in the organization to identify opportunities to build values alignment and improve the practice environment |\n|  | Convene graduate and undergraduate medical education leaders |\n|  | Share best practices and identify gaps |\n|  | Create consensus training well-being standards across the state |\n|  | Develop flexible but consistent curriculum (shared framework) |\n| Promotion of professional fulfillment: organization level strategies | Sponsored participation for immersion Chief Wellness Officer training through existing Stanford Program |\n|  | Leadership Academy for first-line leaders to cultivate leadership skills that promote professional fulfillment |\n|  | Disseminate best practices to promote psychological safety, appreciation, vulnerability, professionalism, mission alignment, and compassion for patients, colleagues and self |\n| Universal prevention of burnout: organization and individual level strategies | Online interactive tools to self-calibrate |\n|  | Individualized feedback linked to resources for wellness promotion |\n|  | Maintenance of Certificaiton and Continuing Medical Education certified well-being training modules |\n|  | Develop communities of physicians through a state-wide commensality group program |\n| Selective prevention for physicians at elevated risk for burnout | Provide timely resources and support for physicians named in malpractice suits or dealing with difficult clinical outcomes (eg, peer support program) |\n|  | Provide timely resources for physicians in transition (eg, facilitated mentorship at the health care organization or county medical society level, for newly licensed physicians in the state or physicians joining the organization) |\n| Indicated intervention for physicians with burnout | Professional coaching for physicians with mild to moderate burnout |\n|  | Free 1 week retreat available 4 times per year to begin process of recovery for physicians experiencing severe burnout |\n| Timely mental health treatment | Online self-assessment linked to modules with information regarding mental health issues |\n|  | Vetted network of health care providers across the state with expertise in physician mental health, able to deliver rapid access |\n\n【92】These strategies will be delivered through a combination of online resources, local communities of physicians, centrally coordinated peer-support and coaching resources, free week-long recovery programs for physicians with severe burnout who are considering leaving the profession, and a robust and vetted referral network of mental health care professionals across the state trained to deliver timely treatment to physicians when needed. All licensed physicians in the state will receive invitations to complete self-assessment along with delivery of personalized recommendations regarding resources in the program they may find most helpful. The program also includes a robust process to support and engage the organizations in which physicians work through longitudinal assessment, customized reports with benchmarking, and partnership, as well as training for both executive and first-line leaders in those organizations to help them strengthen organizational culture and improve the practice environment. Undergraduate and post-graduate medical education leaders across the state will be convened to create standardized physician well-being curriculum objectives. The program also includes state- and federal-level advocacy to promote necessary regulatory and policy changes to address issues in the health care delivery system that contribute to clinician distress.\n\n【93】The endeavor includes rigorous quantitative and qualitative data analysis to guide development, evaluation, and iterative improvement of program components at each level of the population health framework.\n\n【94】Ideal Future State\n------------------\n\n【95】We envision a future state for the profession of medicine characterized by highly engaged, professionally fulfilled, and dedicated physicians practicing in a thoughtfully designed environment. A population health approach to achieve this future state is characterized by an integrated set of universal strategies to promote well-being for all physicians, selective prevention for groups of physicians at higher than average risk, indicated intervention for individual physicians experiencing job-related distress, and unfettered access to treatment for physicians with anxiety, depression, or suicidal ideation. For optimum efficacy, this approach must engage organizations and incite change in the culture of medicine by promulgating a professional environment of self-care, community, peer-support, and help-seeking when distress occurs.\n\n【96】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【97】Healing the Professional Culture of Medicine.\n\n【98】Large-scale implementation of this approach is already underway in California.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

These technologies include tools and methods for sequence analysis (nucleotide and protein sequences), rendering of secondary and tertiary structures for these molecules, and protein fold prediction that can lead to rational drug design.

Unfortunately, they chose to state a contention rather than take the approach of most researchers—attempt to gather information or evidence first, analyze the data, and then make conclusions based on data rather than assumptions and personal opinions.\n\n【1】The results we reported in the article on silent pain sufferers\n\n【2】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【3】Silent pain sufferers.\n\n【4】are part of a much larger epidemiological study designed to evaluate the community prevalence of chronic pain, the types of chronic pain identified by community residents, and the medical and alternative types of treatment that those residents report using. As a primary care physician and the senior “medical researcher” and author on the project, I accepted this research grant from AstraZeneca because I am interested in knowing what the people in my community are actually using to treat their chronic pain, how satisfied they are with my and my colleagues' care, and, indeed, whether they are using that care. The data reported in our article suggest that we (physicians) are not serving a segment of the chronic pain population. Perhaps this could be labeled as a search for a new market for our medical services—one we as physicians do not seem to be serving well. Or, as stated in our article, perhaps these people have learned to cope with their pain problems and do not need our services.\n\n【5】The comments by Holtby and Wakewich regarding “market-driven research” are apparently phrased to be insulting or degrading to the study and its authors. I hope that the health care market—which I define as the needs of all people in a community regardless of whether they actually use health care services—drives most of medical research. To my knowledge, AstraZeneca has only 2 medications that are used for pain: one for anesthesia induction and the other for acute migraine headaches. Neither is indicated for management of chronic pain. I found no phase 1, 2, or 3 clinical trials for chronic pain medications registered to AstraZeneca in the National Institutes of Health or Food and Drug Administration clinical trial indexes. The need to find a “market” for a drug that does not appear to be in production or testing is unlikely to have been a motivation for funding. Perhaps instead, AstraZeneca, like many other pharmaceutical companies, is willing to fund research to identify new directions for their drug development programs. To identify needs and fill gaps instead of simply developing another “me too” drug is an approach that many health care professionals would find refreshing.\n\n【6】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【7】“Me-too” products—friend or foe? \\[letter\\].\n\n【8】Dr Watkins is a young and very talented epidemiologist.

In young healthy people, these vessels are compliant and stretch and then recoil in a way that smooths the flow of blood to the periphery. With aging and diseases like hypertension, these vessels stiffen. Such stiffening changes the way energy is transmitted up and down the vascular tree with each heart beat. This change causes an increased “pulsatile load” on the heart that can contribute to atherogenesis, ventricular stiffening, and end-organ damage, especially in the brain and kidney.\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】Effects of central arterial aging on the structure and function of the peripheral vasculature: implications for end-organ damage.\n\n【3】Thus, vascular stiffness per se is now considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disease that (while frequently linked) is also independent of hypertension, diabetes, and altered blood lipids.

More than 1100 individuals were recruited and subjected to detailed cardiovascular and renal physiologic phenotyping. Key measurements included blood pressure, pulse pressure (a surrogate marker for vascular stiffness), and pulse wave velocity, a more direct measurement of vascular stiffness. Urinary caffeine and related metabolites were measured, which eliminated the uncertainty associated with survey research techniques that are frequently used to estimate dietary intake.\n\n【17】After exclusion of individuals for missing data and technical issues, a total of 863 participants were included in the final analysis and divided into quartiles of caffeine excretion. The main findings were that mean brachial pulse pressure decreased with increasing caffeine excretion and that mean pulse wave velocity was lower in participants with the highest quartile of caffeine consumption compared with the lowest quartile. The potential explanations for these inverse relationships include mechanisms such as a direct vasodilator action of caffeine and/or perhaps the antioxidants contained in coffee that may, among other things, have an inhibitory effect on vascular smooth muscle proliferation.\n\n【18】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【19】Caffeic acid inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation induced by angiotensin II in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.\n\n【20】This study is important because it is another piece of evidence that caffeine and coffee consumption have, if anything, positive health effects as opposed to the widespread and unsubstantiated concerns about negative health effects from these products. It is also important for two larger reasons. First, the data were collected as a part of a bigger effort to gain insight into “genes and hypertension.” In this context, the cohort studied was “medium-sized” and permitted the sort of detailed phenotyping reported in the article. What the cohort lacks in size compared with very large genetic association studies it perhaps makes up for by its detailed and high-resolution phenotyping performed in the participants. Along these lines, a key question going forward in the era of big data will be how to handle poorly controlled and curated phenotypic data from sources like electronic health records.\n\n【21】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【22】Use of Electronic Health Record Data in Clinical Investigations; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availabilty.\n\n【23】In the enthusiasm for paradigms like “big data,” it is perhaps easy to get caught up in the breathless enthusiasm and forget that no matter the amount of data, the old adage “garbage in, garbage out” likely holds.\n\n【24】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【25】Use of Electronic Health Record Data in Clinical Investigations; Draft Guidance for Industry; Availabilty.\n\n【26】Second, the use of urinary metabolites as opposed to questionnaires was impressive.

The superior durability of LIMA in terms of long-term patency and coronary flow supply compared with other conduits routinely used in CABG, such as the radial artery or the saphenous vein (SV), has historically been attributed to its specific structural attributes and mechanical properties. Differences in endothelial cell function, extracellular matrix composition (eg, a relatively higher elastin content), or cellular arrangement in the tunica media appear to equip the LIMA to be better adapted in enduring the mechanical forces triggered by flow shear stress and wall strain of the coronary flow dynamics and pulsatility. In this issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Shadrin and colleagues\n\n【7】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【8】assemble a comprehensive review on biologic and functional differences in graft conduits for CABG. They are to be congratulated for providing a visionary and balanced revision of the current knowledge, providing physiologic and biologic insights on graft function as well as novel insights on genomic and proteomic profiles of graft conduits; such “omic” profiling enables the development of novel therapeutic strategies. These authors postulate that in addition to superior passive mechanical characteristics, the LIMA displays active biologic function. They describe this as an “autocrine” function that is related to secretion of bioactive molecules such as nitric oxide and the production of endothelial cell–derived microparticles. In particular, they highlight the potential role of specialized exosomes carrying a crucial cargo of combined vasodilatory, antioxidant, and other biologically active molecules, including microRNAs with antiproliferative and antiatherosclerotic properties. These biologic functions are the foundation for high long-term LIMA patency rates and may further have an impact on downstream vessel properties, instigating the regression of coronary atherosclerosis. As an example, in case of composite SV-LIMA grafts, such autocrine activity may possibly prevent postgrafting degeneration of the vein conduit because of improved flow dynamics.\n\n【9】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【10】Although these intriguing hypotheses are mainly based on clinical observations in patients undergoing CABG surgery,\n\n【11】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【12】Arterial grafts protect the native coronary vessels from atherosclerotic disease progression.\n\n【13】of considerable interest are the specific molecular signals that are released by LIMA conduits to the downstream vasculature.\n\n【14】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【15】Prostacyclin production by different human grafts employed in coronary operations.\n\n【16】As the authors themselves point out, the analysis of the exosomal output is essential for a better characterization of the LIMA endocrine function, potentially allowing its molecular editing, ensuring long-term performance and patency. As suggested recently,\n\n【17】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【18】Saphenous vein grafts in contemporary coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\n\n【19】this goal could ideally be achieved by employing a systematic approach realized with modern molecular methods (omics) combined with disease modeling approaches.\n\n【20】A first approach to assess the exosomal graft output and role of LIMA as a drug-eluting graft—the LIMA may be considered a drug-eluting graft—may be by deciphering the molecular profile of the microparticles released under flow conditions that mimic the coronary circulation. Because the LIMA obtained from patients is often not amenable to be used routinely as research material, arteries from animals (eg, pigs) could be employed to measure the release of endothelial cell–derived nanoparticles and microRNAs using, for example, real-time polymerase chain reaction or sequencing methods. The employment of bioreactors simulating the coronary circulation\n\n【21】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【22】Full mimicking of coronary hemodynamics for ex-vivo stimulation of human saphenous veins.\n\n【23】could then be useful to assess the role of variable flow/pressure patterns on the release of these signals, either under ideal working conditions or simulating variable levels of competitive flow experienced by the graft under real implanting conditions, as already assessed in large-animal models.\n\n【24】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【25】Competitive flow arising from varying degrees of coronary artery stenosis affects the blood flow and the production of nitric oxide and endothelin in the internal mammary artery graft.\n\n【26】In addition to investigating the variation in the “endocrine” function of the LIMA in response to changes in the flow/pressure pattern or to competitive flow, this approach could also be used to investigate the molecular and structural changes of the LIMA itself. Indeed, mechanical signaling may play a major role in the pathologic differentiation of vascular grafts (ie, the SV), where the wall strain imposed by the sudden shift from venous to coronary circulation plays an important role in activation and recruitment of adventitial cells prone to differentiate into smooth muscle cells underlying neointima accumulation.\n\n【27】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【28】Coronary artery mechanics induces human saphenous vein remodelling via recruitment of adventitial myofibroblast-like cells mediated by thrombospondin-1.\n\n【29】In such an experimental setting, new mechanically regulated molecular targets may be uncovered in addition to conventional tissue analysis by using next-generation omics techniques. Of interest is single-cell/single-nuclei RNA sequencing that delineates the transcriptome of individual cell types characterized on the basis of phenotype-specific markers.\n\n【30】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【31】Single cell RNA sequencing approaches to cardiac development and congenital heart disease.\n\n【32】These analyses could finally be complemented by adoption of targeted/untargeted proteomics to assess the variation of the extracellular matrix composition during flow/pressure-dependent remodeling.\n\n【33】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【34】A proteomic atlas of the neointima identifies novel druggable targets for preventive therapy.\n\n【35】Other than its drug-eluting graft role as a potential endocrine regulator of downstream vasculature homeostasis, the LIMA may also function as a flow/pressure “shock absorber,” especially when LIMA conduits are employed in composite grafts upstream of the SV graft, preventing neointima accumulation in the venous segment. In this regard, the review in this issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ appropriately discusses the possibility that molecular signals such as nitric oxide or beneficial miRNAs transferring from the LIMA to the SV segment could improve the poor flow dynamics of the SV on the basis of their biochemical or molecular effects. Whereas this is in line with the conclusions of the original article cited in support of this hypothesis,\n\n【36】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【37】Outcomes of left internal mammary artery with saphenous vein composite graft to bypass the left anterior descending artery: a propensity-matched study.\n\n【38】one may also speculate that the compliance of LIMA conduits placed upstream of the SV grafts could in part absorb the high level of wall strain generated by the coronary circulation. This hypothesis is in agreement with the reported characteristics of the wall strain stress in LIMA vs SV grafts based on computational flow dynamics\n\n【39】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【40】and could be explored, again, with systematic approaches achieved with bioreactors and high-throughput molecular profiling.\n\n【41】In summary, the article by Shadrin and colleagues highlights the existence of biologic roles of the LIMA as an effector of CABG remodeling. In addition to stimulating the investigation of the nature and timing of these signals, this article unveils new perspectives for ex vivo CABG conditioning, notably the SV graft, whose durability is far shorter than that of LIMA, to reduce short- and long-term SV graft degeneration.\n\n【42】Potential Competing Interests\n-----------------------------\n\n【43】Dr Jozef Bartunek, associate editor of the journal, had no role in the editorial review of or decision to publish this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Two years later his father, a pipefitter, drove 1,000 miles north to Carnarvon where he found employment at a whaling station. His mother moved the family to Perth 5 years later because she wanted their 4 children to obtain a university education. Although Marshall was a good student, he did not excel, but he had a boundless curiosity and many interests. He attended Newman College (University of Melbourne), where it was felt that his mathematical ability was insufficient to study his initial preference of electrical engineering. Subsequently, he chose medical school and attended the University of Western Australia in Perth.\n\n【1】During medical school, he met and married Adrienne, a psychology student. His internship and residency in internal medicine were completed at Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre (Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital) in Perth. He began his training as a specialist in 1978 and the following year moved to the Royal Perth Hospital to study cardiology. In 1981, he rotated to the gastroenterology division where he met J. Robin Warren, a pathologist. Marshall was looking for a research topic and learned that Warren had a list of patients whose gastric biopsies showed “curved” bacteria. Warren needed a clinician to follow the patients to see what diagnoses they had and their subsequent progress. Marshall had treated a patient with severe abdominal pain but no apparent diagnosis; the only abnormal finding in the patient at endoscopy was erythema of the stomach and curved bacteria in the stomach biopsy. He referred her to a psychiatrist who gave an antidepressant.\n\n【2】In their first meeting, Warren showed slides of the curved bacteria and the histologic features of the gastric mucosa. Marshall was aware of the finding of _Campylobacter jejuni_ as a cause of food-borne gastroenteritis. He noted that the _Campylobacter_ organisms appeared very similar to the curved bacilli that Warren had reported in his gastric biopsies. In reviewing the literature, Marshall found that these curved spiral bacteria had been reported but had been ignored, thought to be an artifact. His gastroenterology rotation ended and in 1982 he became a hematology registrar providing care for bone marrow transplant patients. During the last 6 months of the rotation year he was assigned to Port Hedland Hospital, 1,200 miles north of Perth.\n\n【3】He took his records and notes and continued to study the approximately 100 patients that he and Warren had collected. While at the Port Hedland Hospital, he presented his work to the local College of Physicians Meeting at which it received a mixed response, because at the time emotional stress and spicy food were thought to be the major causes of gastritis and ulcers. His wife, Adrienne, was most helpful in editing his early papers because of her writing skills. She continued to play a major role in his published papers, presentations, and books.\n\n【4】Marshall learned that his contract at the Royal Perth Hospital would not be renewed at the completion of his training as no consultant positions were available. Fortunately, he was approached by the Fremantle Hospital, the smallest teaching hospital in Perth. He accepted a position and developed an enthusiastic group of co-workers, as well as support from the hospital. Further research revealed that the majority of patients with peptic ulcer at the hospital had the curved bacteria in their gastric biopsies, which became known as _Campylobacter pylori_ in 1982. In early 1983, he contacted Dr Martin Skirrow, a gastroenterologist at the Worcester Infirmary in England, who subsequently invited him to present his work at the European Campylobacter Meeting in Brussels. Marshall visited Skirrow in England, where he saw that peptic ulcer patients there had the spiral organism in their biopsies, just as he had seen in Australia. Cliodna McNulty, a registrar at Worcester, successfully isolated the spiral organism.\n\n【5】During the succeeding months, a number of other investigators in Australia and Europe also recognized the presence of bacteria in gastric biopsies of peptic ulcer patients. Marshall and Warren reported in _The Lancet_ in 1984 the presence of the curved bacteria in 77% of 22 patients with gastric ulcer and in 100% of 13 patients with duodenal ulcer. No spiral bacteria were grown from the first 34 cases, presumably because the cultures were discarded too soon; on Easter weekend 1982, a more prolonged culture grew the organism. In 1989 the organism was renamed _Helicobacter pylori_ after ribosomal sequencing showed it was distinct from _Camplyobacter._\n\n【6】Marshall was unsuccessful in developing an animal model, so he decided to experiment upon himself. In 1984, following a baseline endoscopy which showed a normal gastric mucosa, he drank a culture of the organism. Three days later he developed nausea and achlorhydria. Vomiting occurred and on day 8 a repeat endoscopy and biopsy showed marked gastritis and a positive _H. pylori_ culture. At day 14, a third endoscopy was performed and he then began treatment with antibiotics and bismuth. He recovered promptly and thus had fulfilled Koch’s postulates for the role of _H. pylori_ in gastritis.\n\n【7】Late in 1984, Marshall obtained funding from the Australian Medical Research Council to conduct a prospective double-blind trial to determine if antibiotics could cure duodenal ulcer. He moved from Fremantle to the Royal Perth Hospital because more patients would be available for the trial. He then began to work closely with Warren again; they had met only periodically while Marshall was at the Fremantle Hospital.\n\n【8】Marshall was contacted by Procter & Gamble, Co. (P&G) who patented much of his work with treatment using bismuth and antibiotics to treat the gastric bacteria. P&G set up a laboratory at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, where Marshall and his family moved in order to continue his research. In 1994, the National Institutes of Health had a consensus meeting in Washington, DC, that ended with a statement to the effect that the key to treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers was the detection and eradication of _H. pylori_ . In 1994, he took a leave of absence and worked to get the breath test approved by the Food and Drug Administration. He and his family returned to Perth in 1996, when he was awarded a McFarlane Burnet Fellowship, which funded a laboratory at the University of Western Australia. He continues to live in Perth and practices at the University, where he sees patients in the gastroenterology department of the Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital.\n\n【9】He was the recipient of the Lasker Award in 1995 and the Benjamin Franklin medal in 1999. He shared the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology in 2005 with J. Robin Warren. He was honored by a stamp issued by the Solomon Islands in 2014, in a sheet that also depicted penicillin co-discoverer Alexander Fleming.

These risks can be decreased, eliminated, or modified with vaccinations, prophylactic medications, and education. Optimally, pretravel advice must be individualized to a person's medical history, itinerary, and risk behavior. In addition to risk assessment-based immunizations, issues such as traveler's diarrhea, malaria prophylaxis, sexually transmitted diseases, and management of underlying medical problems must form a part of pretravel management. Adventure or prolonged travel or persons with underlying medical diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, transplantation, immunodeficiencies, and dialysis warrant additional preventive measures. This review primarily updates pretravel management of adults.\n\n【1】AIDS ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ), DVT ( deep venous thrombosis ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), TD ( traveler's diarrhea )\n\n【2】As tourism grows, an increasing number of people are traveling to higher-risk destinations; thus, clinicians must become familiar with recommendations for travel health safety. Each year, 30 to 40 million Americans travel outside the United States.\n\n【3】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【4】Outbound travel from the US.

Medical problems are experienced by 20% to 70% of all travelers: 1% to 5% require medical care, 0.01% to 0.1% require emergency air evacuation, and 1 in 100,000 die.\n\n【12】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【13】Health advice and immunizations for travelers.\n\n【14】Although cardiovascular diseases are the most common cause of mortality among travelers, the mortality rate is similar to that for non-travelers.

Risk stratification involves reviewing the itinerary, behavior patterns (such as eating habits), underlying medical history, and vaccine or medication contraindications. Details of the itinerary, lodging, budget, duration, and time to departure are extremely helpful in preparing the traveler for the trip. Prolonged travel, backpacking, low-budget travel, foreign-born individuals returning to visit friends and family, and imminent travel are associated with a higher incidence of travel-related complications. Medical problems or issues such as diabetes, transplantation, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and end-stage renal failure may substantially affect the immunogenicity of vaccines and implications for health while traveling. Live vaccines are contraindicated in immunocompromised or pregnant persons; thus, travel to a particular risk area is not possible. For example, patients who cannot receive the yellow fever vaccine should not travel to the Amazon. Allergies to vaccine components such as thimerosal or aluminum or to medications such as sulfonamides may preclude use of certain vaccines or medications. Contact allergy to thimerosal is not a contraindication to thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n\n【25】GENERAL ADVICE\n--------------\n\n【26】Elderly persons or those with chronic medical diseases may benefit from a pretravel physical examination. Travelers should carry a letter stating medical diagnosis, list of medications with doses, and needles or syringes. Some medications, such as methylphenidate hydrochloride, are prohibited in certain countries. Carrying a letter from a physician may prevent problems at airports. Travelers should carry enough essential medications to last the duration of the trip, and the supply should be divided between carry-on and check-in baggage. Medications should be in original bottles with appropriate labels. Because dental problems can occur, patients with ongoing dental illnesses should have a dental examination before they travel to avoid invasive procedures in other countries. Most health insurance companies do not cover medical expenses that occur outside the United States. Travelers should consider additional travel health and air evacuation insurance, irrespective of their age, medical history, or type of travel.\n\n【27】Studies have shown that 25% to 50% of travelers engage in sexual relations with new partners abroad, including other tourists, locals, or commercial sex workers.\n\n【28】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【29】Risk behaviour and HIV prevalence in international travellers.\n\n【30】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【31】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【32】Differences in sexual risk behaviour between young men and women travelling abroad from the UK.\n\n【33】Discussing alcohol consumption and safe sex with patients may help in preventing sexually transmitted diseases while traveling; this is especially relevant in light of increasing worldwide HIV prevalence. Patients should be advised to bring condoms from the United States because of poor availability or quality of condoms in some developing countries.\n\n【34】Because accidents are the most common preventable cause of mortality during travel,\n\n【35】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【36】Personal safety advice for travelers abroad.\n\n【37】patients must be reminded to avoid high-risk situations, such as driving in a foreign country, riding 2-wheelers (motorcycles, scooters), or riding in overcrowded buses, particularly in adverse weather conditions or under the influence of alcohol. Travelers should follow basic traffic laws. Seat belt use should be encouraged, but the availability of functional seat belts may be severely limited in some developing countries.\n\n【38】Illnesses related to air travel include motion sickness, barotrauma, hypoxemia in select patients, and possibly deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Motion sickness is common with flying. Patients can be advised to take either meclizine or dimenhydrinate for prophylaxis. Although airplanes are pressurized, expansion of air can occur and cause barotrauma in air-or gas-containing organs, particularly the ears, sinuses, and gastrointestinal tract. Swallowing or chewing during take-off and descent may decrease ear barotrauma. Ear barotrauma is more likely to occur in a traveler with a cold or an eustachian tube dysfunction. Occasionally, a serous otitis or tympanic membrane perforation can occur but usually resolves spontaneously. Because of air expansion, air travel is a relative contraindication for patients who have recently undergone abdominal surgery (previous 2 weeks). Patients with severe anemia (hemoglobin level <7 g/dL), sickle cell trait or disease, underlying chronic pulmonary obstructive disease and chronic hypoxia, or recent cerebrovascular accident may experience exacerbation of symptoms. Such patients may need to have oxygen on board, which must be arranged ahead of time with the airlines. Also, most airlines require a physician to verify the patient's ability to fly safely and to provide a certification called the Medical Fitness for Air Travel form.\n\n【39】The available data suggest that an association, although small, exists between air travel and DVT.\n\n【40】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【41】The risk of venous thromboembolism from air travel \\[editorial\\].\n\n【42】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【43】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【44】Thrombosis and air travel.\n\n【45】All patients, particularly those with risk factors such as a history of DVT, recent surgery or trauma, malignancy, obesity, pregnancy, or genetic prothrombotic predisposition and women taking oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, should be advised to exercise their legs during the flight. The role of aspirin in the prevention of DVT is controversial. Compression stockings may be reasonable for patients at risk for DVT, and prophylactic anticoagulation should be considered for very high-risk patients.\n\n【46】Jet lag and fatigue occur commonly in international travelers. Jet lag, typically worse when flying eastward, results from desynchronization of the sleep-wake cycle and other internal circadian rhythms, such as hormonal or temperature rhythms. For short and/or a series of short international flights (<72 hours), the patient should be advised to take brief naps at the corresponding home afternoon time or at late nighttime. Napping for less than 40 minutes avoids reverting to the home sleep cycle. For longer eastward trips, activities should be adjusted to correspond with time on the plane and on arrival. A mild bedtime sedative for 3 to 4 days after arrival at the destination or after return to the United States may help adjust the sleep cycle. Potential adverse effects, such as daytime drowsiness, that may interfere with planned activities or driving should be discussed. Patients could try the medication once before leaving home to ensure no adverse effects. Use of melatonin for jet lag is controversial and has not been clearly shown to be effective.\n\n【47】IMMUNIZATIONS\n-------------\n\n【48】An important part of advice to travelers is vaccination against common and travel-related vaccine-preventable diseases. A review of immunization against diseases such as diphtheria, measles, and polio is advised because some of these diseases are prevalent in many developing countries. Although specific travel-related vaccinations may not be cost-effective,\n\n【49】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【50】Is travel prophylaxis worth while? economic appraisal of prophylactic measures against malaria, hepatitis A, and typhoid in travellers.\n\n【51】they are beneficial and may be required or recommended depending on travel history. Vaccine recommendations are best individualized to each traveler's itinerary, activities, time before departure (for completion of schedules or to mount an adequate immune response), previous immunizations, and medical history.\n\n【52】Travel vaccine schedules, boosters, common contraindications, and adverse effects are listed in Table 1 .\n\n【53】Table 1 Common Vaccines for International Travelers\n\n【54】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【55】AIDS = acquired immunodeficiency syndrome;

Incidence of cholera is highest in Africa, accounting for 72% of global cholera. At present, an epidemic of _V cholerae_ biotype _eltor_ , is ongoing in South Africa. Peru, Ecuador, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and countries in the Middle East and Asia have ongoing seventh pandemic cases. Because the risk of cholera to an average traveler is low (0.01%-0.001% per month of stay in a developing country),\n\n【66】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【67】Cholera vaccines.\n\n【68】a cholera vaccine is rarely indicated. However, vaccination is advised for persons working with refugee populations, those living in endemic-epidemic areas, and military personnel. Currently, cholera vaccine is not required for entry into any country. The parenteral vaccine has been discontinued in the United States because of its frequent adverse effects and brief and unreliable immunogenicity. Newer oral cholera vaccines (an inactivated whole cell-B subunit vaccine and a live attenuated CVD 103-HgR _V cholerae_ 01 serogroup vaccine) provide better immunity (85%-90% and 60%-100%, respectively) with fewer adverse effects.\n\n【69】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【70】Cholera vaccines.\n\n【71】Both of these vaccines are licensed in countries other than the United States. Therefore, the current best advice for travelers going to cholera-endemic areas is to adhere to strict food and water precautions and to learn self-management of severe watery diarrhea.\n\n【72】### Hepatitis A and Immunoglobulin\n\n【73】Hepatitis A is a predominantly food-borne viral hepatitis that occurs worldwide. Risk is low in Australia, Japan, Korea, North America, and Europe including southern Europe. Hepatitis A is the most frequently occurring vaccine-preventable disease among travelers. Ingestion of fecally contaminated water or food, such as raw seafood, is the source of infection. The risk increases with indiscriminate eating habits, person-to-person contact, and prolonged travel duration. The risk of acquisition of hepatitis A among nonimmune travelers is 3 to 20 cases per 1000 nonimmune persons who stay in a developing country for at least a month.\n\n【74】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【75】Epidemiology and prevention of hepatitis A in travelers.\n\n【76】Approximately 10% of 1- to 14-year-old and 20% of 15- to 40-year-old patients with hepatitis A require hospitalization. Mortality increases with age, being greater than 2% in persons older than 40 years. The inactivated hepatitis A vaccines (Vaqta \\[Merck\\] and Havrix \\[SmithKline Beecham\\]), available in the United States since the mid-1990s, are extremely efficacious and safe. Both vaccines provide protective antibody levels in 94% to 100% of patients within 4 weeks of vaccination,\n\n【77】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【78】Prevention of hepatitis A through active or passive immunization: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).\n\n【79】and both can be used interchangeably. Immunity among children younger than 2 years is limited because of poor immunogenicity. Maternal antibody interferes with immunity in children younger than 12 months. Immune response may be limited in immunocompromised hosts. US immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of hepatitis A who visit their home countries should be vaccinated according to hepatitis A serostatus because most are likely to be immune. Coadministration of passive immunity (85%-90% protection)\n\n【80】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【81】Prevention of hepatitis A through active or passive immunization: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).\n\n【82】with γ-globulin should be reserved for high-risk patients traveling imminently (<2 weeks), such as elderly persons, children younger than 2 years, those with underlying medical problems, or immunocompromised persons. Concurrent administration of most vaccines is not contraindicated with γ-globulin except the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine and varicella vaccine. Because of the long incubation period of hepatitis A virus and the rapid onset of protection with the vaccine, the vaccine alone may be adequate in most healthy persons for whom travel is imminent.\n\n【83】### Hepatitis B Vaccine\n\n【84】Areas with a high prevalence of hepatitis B include Asia, Africa, parts of South America, the Middle East, southern and western Pacific islands, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. Risk of hepatitis B for travelers is mainly associated with medical or dental care abroad, potential blood transfusion for an accident or illness, and sexual or needle exposures. Expatriation and frequent or prolonged international travel to developing countries are indications for initiating inactivated recombinant hepatitis B vaccination (Recombivax HB \\[Merck\\]; Engerix-B \\[SmithKline Beecham\\]). Health care workers, volunteers, or missionaries in developing countries require the hepatitis B vaccine series. For patients leaving imminently, an accelerated schedule can be used to achieve protective immunity. Currently, only Engerix-B has received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an accelerated schedule of 0, 1, and 2 months with a 12-month booster.\n\n【85】### Combined Hepatitis A and B Vaccine\n\n【86】A new combined hepatitis A (Havrix \\[720 EL U/mL\\]) and hepatitis B (Engerix-B \\[20 μg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen\\]) vaccine called Twinrix (SmithKline Beecham) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for use in adults older than 18 years. Twinrix is given on a 0-, 1-, and 6-month schedule. Studies have shown that Twinrix is as efficacious as the monovalent vaccines of Havrix (99% of the vaccinees are seropositive at 2 months) and for hepatitis B (84% of the vaccinees are seropositive at 2 months).\n\n【87】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【88】Immunization against hepatitis A and hepatitis B infections.\n\n【89】This vaccine is convenient for long-term travelers and for those who need rapid protection.\n\n【90】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【91】The first combined vaccine against hepatitis A and B: an overview.\n\n【92】An accelerated schedule of 0, 7, and 21 days with a 12-month booster is as efficacious as a standard schedule.\n\n【93】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【94】Immunization against hepatitis A and hepatitis B infections.\n\n【95】Indications for this vaccine are similar to those for hepatitis B vaccine in travelers.\n\n【96】### Japanese B Encephalitis Vaccine\n\n【97】Japanese B encephalitis is a mosquito-borne viral encephalitis that occurs in rural parts of Asia, especially near pig farms. It is prevalent in China, the Indian subcontinent, Japan, eastern Russia, and other Southeast Asian countries. It has seasonal variation (more in summer, rainy months). Japanese B encephalitis has a 30% case fatality rate in patients with overt infections, with high neuropsychiatric sequelae. Risk of acquisition is mainly associated with extensive (=4 weeks) rural travel, backpacking, or rain forest travel in endemic countries. The full course of the inactivated Japanese B encephalitis vaccine (Biken) results in seroconversion in 100% of recipients, and neutralizing antibodies remain for at least 3 years. Common adverse effects like myalgias, headache, or fever occur in 20% of vaccine recipients, and hypersensitivity reactions (generalized urticaria, angioedema, respiratory distress, and anaphylaxis) occur in 0.6% of recipients.\n\n【98】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【99】Inactivated Japanese encephalitis virus vaccine: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).\n\n【100】Hypersensitivity reactions can be immediate or delayed up to 10 days and are more likely in persons with a history of urticaria or other allergies. Patients with Japanese B encephalitis must defer international travel and remain in areas with ready access to medical care for 10 days after receiving a dose of the vaccine.\n\n【101】### Meningococcal Vaccine\n\n【102】Certain areas of the world, especially central Africa, have seasonal epidemics caused by _Neisseria meningitidis_ , mostly serogroups A or C, during the dry seasons (December through June). _N meningitidis_ is also an important cause of disease among travelers taking the Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, and vaccination is required for entry into Saudi Arabia. The currently available vaccine in the United States (Menomune \\[Aventis\\]) is effective only against serogroups A, C, Y, and W-135 and does not cover serogroup B. Since October 1999, meningococcal vaccine has been recommended for college students living in US dormitories. Requirements are similar for students traveling abroad to study in other countries, such as the United Kingdom.\n\n【103】### Poliomyelitis Vaccine\n\n【104】Although poliomyelitis is reaching near eradication worldwide, pockets with ongoing wild strain transmission still exist, such as in African countries and in Asia. Poliomyelitis was declared eradicated from the Western Hemisphere until a recent outbreak of vaccine-strain polio in Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Currently, all travelers to Haiti, the Dominican Republic, eastern Europe, Africa, and Asia are advised to receive a 1-time adult parenteral inactivated trivalent polio vaccine booster if the primary series has been completed.\n\n【105】### Rabies\n\n【106】Unlike the United States where the principal vectors for rabies are wild animals or bats, in many parts of the world, particularly India, Nepal, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Peru, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Vietnam, rabies is transmitted by dogs, cats, and other animals. A rabies preexposure vaccination with the inactivated viral rabies vaccine (HDCV \\[Imovax\\]) is recommended for expatriates, especially children, adventure travelers, and animal handlers. Preexposure prophylaxis precludes the need for rabies immunoglobulin if a bite occurs. Scarcity and safety of the rabies immunoglobulin worldwide highlights preexposure prophylaxis for select populations. If bitten, persons with preexposure vaccination still require 2 additional rabies vaccine doses (on the day of the bite and on day 3, instead of a full 5-dose course). All animals that bite, especially unprovoked, outside of the United States should be considered rabid unless proved otherwise, particularly in highly endemic countries. Patients should be advised to wash the wound immediately and seek medical care as soon as possible.\n\n【107】### Typhoid Fever\n\n【108】Typhoid vaccine is recommended for travel to regions highly endemic for _Salmonella typhi_ , such as the Indian subcontinent, parts of South America, and Africa. Travel to Mexico, Haiti, North Africa, and Iran is considered intermediate risk. Protective efficacy of the typhoid vaccines ranges from 46% to 96%.\n\n【109】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【110】Immunizations for international travel.\n\n【111】The oral typhoid vaccine is not currently available in the United States. The older parenteral vaccine (Wyeth-Ayerst) had pronounced local and systemic adverse effects and has not been available in the United States since December 1999. The available typhoid vaccine (injectable Typhim Vi \\[Pasteur Merieux Connaught\\]) is better tolerated and has a protective efficacy of 64% to 72%. A new combined vaccine against typhoid fever and hepatitis A is being studied, and thus far it has been found to be safe and efficacious.\n\n【112】### Yellow Fever\n\n【113】Yellow fever is a mosquito-borne viral illness characterized by fever, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatitis, and encephalitis. The yellow fever vaccine must be administered at least 10 days before travel to endemic areas, such as equatorial parts of South America and Africa. It is a required vaccine for entry into some countries with ongoing epidemics. In other uninfected countries, a person must show proof of vaccination if traveling directly from an endemic or infected country in order to prevent introduction of the disease into the local vector. Since the yellow fever vaccine is a live-attenuated viral vaccine, it is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients, pregnant or lactating women, and infants younger than 6 months. Among immunocompromised persons, the risk of the actual disease vs the disease from the vaccine must be assessed. Persons with HIV or AIDS who have minimal immunosuppression (CD4 count >200 cells μL) can receive the vaccine. However, the immune response may be lower among these people compared with immunocompe-tent persons. Recently, vaccine strain disease was reported among elderly (>75 years) persons receiving the yellow fever vaccine.\n\n【114】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【115】Travel–related vaccines.\n\n【116】### Routine Vaccines\n\n【117】Routine childhood vaccinations should be reviewed for all persons and boosters administered as necessary. In addition, pneumococcal and influenza vaccine recommendations should be reviewed. An influenza vaccine is advised for persons at high risk of influenza complications, such as those taking a cruise, traveling to the Southern Hemisphere during April through September, or traveling to tropical countries any time because influenza is nonseasonal in such areas, and for persons older than 50 years with or without underlying medical problems. Persons with no previous history of primary varicella should be tested and vaccinated if nonimmune.\n\n【118】MALARIA PREVENTION\n------------------\n\n【119】Annually, 300 to 500 million cases of malaria occur in more than 100 countries, and the numbers are increasing because of climate and other factors. Malaria among travelers is also increasing. _Plasmodium falciparum_ contributes to most malaria-related deaths. Approximately 30,000 travelers from industrialized countries contract malaria annually.\n\n【120】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【121】Health advice and immunizations for travelers.\n\n【122】In the United States, about 1000 cases are reported annually to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; however, some may be unreported.\n\n【123】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【124】Transfusion–transmitted malaria—Missouri and Pennsylvania, 1996–1998.\n\n【125】The risk of acquiring malaria depends on the duration of stay, geographic areas visited, risk behavior (extensive exposure to outdoors and rural areas and inadequate personal protective measures), and the type of prophylaxis taken. Among American travelers, the risk of _P falciparum_ malaria is highest among those traveling to Africa. Imported _P falciparum_ malaria has an overall mortality rate of 4% and is considerably higher in patients with severe disease. The mortality rate also increases with age (30% in persons >70 years). Fatal imported malaria is associated with nonadherence with or inappropriate chemoprophylaxis, delay in seeking medical attention, or delayed diagnosis or treatment.\n\n【126】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【127】Imported malaria: prospective analysis of problems in diagnosis and management.\n\n【128】Thus, travelers must seek appropriate pretravel advice for this preventable condition.\n\n【129】The choice of malaria chemoprophylaxis depends on area of travel, activities planned, and the individual's factors. Chloroquine-resistant _P falciparum_ malaria now dominates most endemic regions except Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, and parts of the Middle East. _P falciparum_ malaria resistant to chloroquine and mefloquine has emerged along the borders of Thailand, Cambodia, and Myanmar (Burma). Resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimeth-amine is common among _P falciparum_ in the Amazon basin, Southeast Asia, and in parts of Africa. Over the past decade, chloroquine-resistant _P vivax_ malaria has been identified in Myanmar, Guyana, Papua New Guinea, and other areas of Southeast Asia.\n\n【130】Chemoprophylaxis is recommended for all urban and rural travelers to sub-Saharan Africa (except most areas of South Africa), the Indian subcontinent, areas of Oceania (Far Southeast Asia including Papua New Guinea, Irian Jaya, and Vanuata), and Haiti, as well as for rural and nonresort exposures in Southeast Asia, Central and South America, and parts of Mexico, North Africa, and the Dominican Republic. Antimalarial prophylactic drug options based on drug-resistance patterns are listed in Table 2 .\n\n【131】Table 2 Malaria Prophylaxis\n\n| Prophylaxis | Chloroquine-susceptible areas\\*See text for areas of distribution. | Chloroquine-resistant areas\\*See text for areas of distribution. | Chloroquine- and mefloquine-resistant areas\\*See text for areas of distribution. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| First choice First alternative | Chloroquine Mefloquine | Mefloquine Doxycycline | Doxycycline Atovaquone plus proguanil |\n| Other alternatives | Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, doxycycline | Atovaquone plus proguanil | … |\n\n【133】\\* See text for areas of distribution.\n\n【134】Chloroquine-susceptible _P falciparum_ malaria is now limited to Central America. Chloroquine is well tolerated, has minimal adverse effects (gastrointestinal upset being most common), and is safe for infants and pregnant women. Retinal toxicity is rare, even with long-term (years) weekly administration of chloroquine.\n\n【135】Mefloquine is the most widely used antimalarial prophylactic agent and is more than 90% efficacious.\n\n【136】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【137】Mefloquine compared with doxycycline for the prophylaxis of malaria in Indonesian soldiers: a randomized, double–blind, placebo–controlled trial.\n\n【138】It is given weekly as 250-mg salt, starting 1 to 2 weeks before travel, weekly while in the endemic area, and for 4 weeks after return. Mefloquine is recommended for chloroquine-resistant malaria (both _P falciparum_ and _P vivax_ ). Adverse effects of mefloquine are mostly dose related. At prophylactic doses, most adverse effects are mild and self-limited, including nausea, diarrhea, strange dreams, dizziness, insomnia, and headache. Nightmares, anxiety, and depression can occur, but drug discontinuation is necessary in less than 1% of prophylactic mefloquine users. Severe neuro-psychiatric reactions (psychosis, seizures) are reported to occur infrequently (approximately 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 13,000 persons) with prophylactic doses.\n\n【139】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【140】Health advice and immunizations for travelers.\n\n【141】Contraindications to its use include history of seizures, arrhythmias, psychiatric illness, and a previous reaction to mefloquine. Mefloquine is safe for pregnant women in the second and third trimester and for children who weigh more than 5 kg.\n\n【142】Doxycycline (100 mg/d) is the alternative to mefloquine and is an equally efficacious prophylactic agent against mefloquine-resistant _P falciparum_ . Major drawbacks of doxycycline are daily administration (leading to rapid loss of antimalarial prophylaxis with missed doses), nausea, vomiting, occasional esophageal ulceration, photosensitivity, yeast superinfections, and inability to use in pregnant women and in children younger than 8 years. Advantages of doxycycline include quick onset of antimalarial activity, allowing administration for imminent entry into an endemic area, and some antibacterial effect against traveler's diarrhea (TD).\n\n【143】In 2000, the FDA approved atovaquone plus proguanil (250 mg/100 mg) (Malarone) for malaria prophylaxis and treatment in children and adults. Overall efficacy of Malarone for prophylaxis of _P falciparum_ malaria is 95% to 100% compared with placebo in semi-immune populations.\n\n【144】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【145】Efficacy and safety of atovaquone/proguanil as suppressive prophylaxis for _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria.\n\n【146】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【147】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【148】A randomized, double–blind, placebo–controlled field trial to determine the efficacy and safety of Malarone (atovaquone/proguanil) for the prophylaxis of malaria in Zambia.\n\n【149】In nonimmune persons, the protection is 96% (68%-99%) for _P falciparum_ malaria and 81% (45%-94%) for _P vivax_ malaria. It is well tolerated, with mild gastrointestinal side effects being the most common adverse events. The main drawbacks are daily administration and cost, currently about $5 a day. For prophylaxis, Malarone is taken daily: initiated 2 days before the traveler enters an endemic area, taken daily while there, and taken for 7 days after return. It has some causal activity, ie, it is effective against the liver phase of the plasmodium life cycle. The prophylactic use of Malarone is best limited to travelers to chloroquine-resistant malaria areas who have contraindications to mefloquine and doxycycline or to travelers going to endemic areas for brief (2–7 days) trips. Malarone is also used for self-treatment of suspected malaria if a person develops malaria while in a foreign country and prophylaxis was inadequate, as long as the prophylaxis taken was not Malarone. It is the drug of choice for self-treatment in areas where sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance is common.\n\n【150】In some countries, another alternative to mefloquine or doxycycline is a combination of chloroquine with proguanil. However, it is not recommended because it is not as efficacious as the previously mentioned drugs. Proguanil is not available in the United States.\n\n【151】New antimalarials being studied for prophylaxis include tafenoquine, primaquine, etaquine, and azithromycin.\n\n【152】Use of personal protection measures, such as insect repellents, mosquito bed nets, and long-sleeved clothing and pants, should be reinforced to persons traveling to tropical countries not only for malaria protection but also for other insect-borne diseases.\n\n【153】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【154】Mosquitoes and mosquito repellents: a clinician's guide.\n\n【155】Formulations with 30% to 35% of DEET ( _N_ , _N_ \\-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) are recommended for adequate protection and minimal toxic adverse effects. Of importance, patients should be reminded that sunscreen is applied first and then the insect repellent because insect repellents can decrease the efficacy of the sunscreen by 20% to 30%.\n\n【156】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【157】Insect repellents and the efficacy of sunscreens \\[letter\\].\n\n【158】Plant-based insect repellents are not as effective as those containing DEET. Persons traveling into highly endemic areas or forests or those planning extensive outdoor exposure may be advised to use a clothing insecticide called permethrin. Permethrin impregnation of clothes is effective for 2 weeks despite laundry. Combined use of skin insect repellent and permethrin can decrease insect bites substantially.\n\n【159】TRAVELER'S DIARRHEA\n-------------------\n\n【160】Traveler's diarrhea is common during international travel, especially travel to developing countries. It accounts for 64% of all illnesses affecting tourists, and the most common cause is bacterial. Enterotoxigenic _Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella_ , and _Shigella_ account for most cases _._ Enterotoxigenic _E coli_ occurs in 17% to 70% of TD in South America. Rotavirus, _Campylobacter_ , and _Salmonella_ occur more often in the winter. Parasitic etiology is not common in short-term travelers. _Cyclospora_ is commonly noted in Nepal. A pathogen is not identified in 40% of TD cases. In a study of 17,000 travelers, the incidence of TD was 26% to 50% in Central and South American countries, 40% in Africa, 50% in Nepal, and 10% in Europe.\n\n【161】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【162】Traveller's diarrhea among Austrian tourists in warm climate countries, I: epidemiology.\n\n【163】The highest incidence of diarrhea occurs among children 2 years of age and younger and among adults 20 to 30 years of age. Although TD does not result in mortality, approximately one third of travelers are confined to bed, 40% have to change their itinerary, and less than 1% are hospitalized.\n\n【164】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【165】Traveler's diarrhea: epidemiology and clinical aspects.\n\n【166】Host factors predisposing to TD include immunosuppression, hypochlorhydria, inflammatory bowel disease such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease, and young age.\n\n【167】Prevention of TD includes education regarding risk factors and food and water hygiene. Risk factors include drinking tap water, iced drinks, or fresh juices; eating food in small restaurants or from vendors; eating locally made ice cream or flavored ices; and eating fruit not personally peeled by the traveler.\n\n【168】Patients with immunosuppression such as transplant recipients, those taking corticosteroids, and those with chronic medical problems such as inflammatory bowel disease may require prophylactic antibiotics to prevent TD. Prophylactic medications for TD include bismuth subsalicylate, antibiotics, or probiotic agents. Bismuth subsalicylate is effective in preventing 65% of cases of TD.\n\n【169】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【170】Travelers’ diarrhea: epidemiology, prevention, and self–treatment.\n\n【171】However, the disadvantages of bismuth subsalicylate include the number of doses needed, problems among patients taking aspirin or an anticoagulant, and black discoloration of the tongue and stool. Additionally, bismuth subsalicylate can decrease bioavailability of doxycycline by 30% to 50%, an important fact to remember in patients taking doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis. Use of antibiotics for TD prophylaxis is reserved for a select population, as described previously. Prophylactic ciprofloxacin has been shown to prevent 90% of cases of TD.\n\n【172】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【173】Travelers’ diarrhea: epidemiology, prevention, and self–treatment.\n\n【174】Other antibiotics used for prophylaxis include trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline. However, both have limited efficacy because of increasing resistance of diarrheal pathogens worldwide.\n\n【175】Self-treatment of TD consists of fluid replacement, with or without use of an antibiotic, and an antimotility agent if needed. Fluid replacement is important, especially if the person has frequent episodes of diarrhea, is in hot climates, or has a fever. For mild diarrhea, drinking any fluids may be sufficient. However, for watery TD, fluids containing electrolytes and glucose are required. This can be accomplished by drinking water reconstituted with widely available oral rehydration salts approved by the World Health Organization. Proper use of loperamide should be explained to minimize the risk of complications developing with its use. Loperamide is effective for symptomatic relief of TD. For travelers with moderate diarrhea (4 to 5 stools a day, inability to participate in the planned activity), self-treatment using an antibiotic with loperamide is advised. However, those with severe diarrhea, ie, diarrhea associated with fever (temperature >38.3°C) or bloody stools, should be advised to take an antibiotic for 3 to 5 days without loperamide. Bloody diarrhea may represent shigella toxin-producing _E coli_ 0157 or shigellosis. In such situations, antimotility agents can be potentially harmful and are best avoided. Travelers with severe, persistent, or bloody diarrhea should seek care at a local medical facility for appropriate evaluation.\n\n【176】Fluoroquinolones are the most commonly used empirical self-treatment of TD. Antibiotics reduce the duration of diarrhea from 3 to 5 days to fewer than 1 to 2 days.\n\n【177】<sup><a>30</a></sup>\n\n【178】Practice guidelines for the management of infectious diarrhea.\n\n【179】Studies have shown that ciprofloxacin with loperamide is more effective than a 3-day course of ciprofloxacin alone and much more effective than a single dose of ciprofloxacin.\n\n【180】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【181】Travelers’ diarrhea: epidemiology, prevention, and self–treatment.\n\n【182】A single 750-mg dose of ciprofloxacin can be used for mild to moderate diarrhea. However, if TD continues, a 3- to 5-day course should be completed. Other fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, norfloxacin, or ofloxacin, can be used. Worldwide fluoroquinolone resistance among _Campylobacter, Salmonella_ , and _Shigella_ may result in the failure of empirical treatment. The best alternative to the fluoroquinolones for self-treatment of TD is azithromycin. In 2 clinical trials, azithromycin had 82% cure rates for multidrug-resistant _Shigella_ compared with 89% with ciprofloxacin.\n\n【183】<sup><a>31</a></sup>\n\n【184】Treatment of shigellosis, V: comparison of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin: a double–blind, randomized, controlled trial.\n\n【185】For TD from other pathogens, azithromycin had a cure rate of 86% compared with 100% with ciprofloxacin. Azithromycin was more effective against _Campylobacter_ TD than ciprofloxacin (62% vs 48%).\n\n【186】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【187】Use of azithromycin for the treatment of _Campylobacter_ enteritis in travelers to Thailand, an area where ciprofloxacin resistance is prevalent.\n\n【188】Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline, or oral cephalosporins have limited activity due to increasing antimicrobial resistance.\n\n【189】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【190】Although it has associated risks, travel to any part of the world can be safe with adequate pretravel preparation. The key to appropriate pretravel advice is to obtain details of the itinerary, review the medical history, and be aware of current recommendations. Special risk groups, such as pregnant women, immunocompromised hosts, small children, and elderly persons with medical problems, may require additional preparation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Most of the current debate in Congress and the public press has been concerned with ways to increase health insurance coverage among uninsured individuals and has had little to do with restructuring the US health care delivery system. Fortunately, during the past 5 years, a number of new policy initiatives have attempted to improve the quality of care and the dollar value of health services purchased. One of the more promising of these efforts has focused on improving physician-patient decisions on the choice of treatment when several alternative interventions have been shown to be safe; this type of analysis is known as _comparative effectiveness research_ . This approach was endorsed in an Institute of Medicine report that supports better decision making in health care.\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】Institute of Medicine.\n\n【3】in: Eden J Wheatley B McNeil B Sox H Knowing What Works in Health Care: A Roadmap for the Nation. National Academies Press , Washington, DC 2008\n\n【4】Comparative effectiveness research received financial support with the passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which allocated more than $1 billion to conduct studies in this area. Since President Obama signed this act, several federal funding agencies, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, have published prioritized lists of clinical areas for comparative effectiveness research and requested proposals to conduct studies.\n\n【5】In this issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Simpson et al\n\n【6】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【7】Cardiovascular and economic outcomes after initiation of lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin vs simvastatin in an employed population.\n\n【8】report the results of their study that compared the cost of initiating lipid-lowering therapy between the 2 most common statin medications: atorvastatin and simvastatin. Their article discusses the type of clinical questions that comparative effectiveness studies are attempting to address. One prior head-to-head randomized clinical trial that compared the usual dose of simvastatin to high-dose atorvastatin found that atorvastatin statistically reduced nonfatal acute myocardial infarction even though there was no significant difference in the other major cardiovascular outcomes: death due to coronary heart disease or cardiac arrest with resuscitation.\n\n【9】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【10】High-dose atorvastatin vs usual-dose simvatatin for secondary prevention after myocardial infarction: the IDEAL study: a randomized clinical trial.\n\n【11】The incremental clinical benefit of atorvastatin comes at a high cost because simvastatin is available in generic form, whereas atorvastatin is still under patent protection. A previous editorial in this journal suggested that, given the incremental benefits at increased cost, the value of atorvastatin compared with that of simvastatin can be determined only by cost-effectiveness studies.\n\n【12】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【13】Primary prevention and statins: is it just about going to class \\[editorial\\]?\n\n【14】Simpson et al\n\n【15】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【16】Cardiovascular and economic outcomes after initiation of lipid-lowering therapy with atorvastatin vs simvastatin in an employed population.\n\n【17】take a step in that direction by conducting a cost (net benefit) analysis from the employer's perspective of the 2 statin medications. They used a retrospective study design, based on administrative data from 23 health plans, to examine clinical differences in outcomes (the rates of 8 inpatient cardiovascular events), total all-cause direct medical costs, and indirect medical cost (disability payments and indirect cost through work loss) between atorvastatin and simvastatin. Their matched-cohort study sample paired each patient in the atorvastatin cohort with 1 patient in the simvastatin cohort on the basis of 4 factors: (1) initial drug dose, (2) baseline inpatient cardiovascular events, (3) average wage, and (4) the predicted probability of being a member of the atorvastatin vs simvastatin cohort. The study sample consisted of 13,584 matched pairs (98% of the original simvastatin sample) who were employed for at least 2 years after initiation of a lipid-lowering therapy. The authors used standard, appropriate statistical analysis to value all resources consumed, both direct medical and indirect cost, in 2006 US dollars. These results are reported in detail in Table 2 of their article.\n\n【18】Of note, since the authors conducted this study from the perspective of the employer, all health care outcome benefits and indirect medical resources consumed (disability and medically related absenteeism) were converted into costs. Results of their study showed that the net cost of initiation of atorvastatin vs simvastatin during the 2-year period was approximately $41. This suggests that employers should not pay for atorvastatin compared with simvastatin. However, because medication cost between the 2 cohorts is the single largest cost difference, atorvastatin could be the lower cost choice if its price was reduced. In fact, the authors calculated that a 9% price reduction would result in atorvastatin saving employers $44 per employee compared with simvastatin.\n\n【19】What should an employer do? We think that comparative effectiveness research may help the employer make a decision. Some interesting comparative effectiveness results can be made using the information presented in Table 2 in the article by Simpson et al. From the employer's perspective, assume that the primary cost between the 2 medication cohorts is the cost of direct health resources consumed by their employees: the number of health services consumed (hospitalization, emergency department visits, and outpatient visits). Data in Table 2 indicate no statistical differences in any health care resources consumed between the 2 cohorts in terms of average number of inpatient days (1.2 days in both cohorts), emergency department visits (0.7 in both cohorts), and outpatient visits (atorvastatin cohort had 0.4 fewer outpatient visits; _P_ \\=.06). However, the employer receives 1 significant benefit of atorvastatin compared with simvastatin: a reduction in medically related absenteeism of 0.3 days ( _P_ \\=.02) per employee during the 2-year study period. At this point, one can approximate the comparative effectiveness of atorvastatin to simvastatin by dividing the difference in average direct medical cost by the difference in average benefit between the 2 study cohorts. The information in Table 2 indicates that the difference in total average cost of direct medical services between the 2 cohorts is $164 (higher cost in the atorvastatin cohort), and the average difference in medically related absenteeism between the 2 cohorts is 0.3 days (fewer missed days in the atorvastatin cohort). This suggests that an employer pays approximately $546 ($546 = $164/0.3) to reduce medically related absenteeism by 1 day when atorvastatin is initiated vs simvastatin. One could also approximate a 10% reduction in the cost of atorvastatin by reducing the average index cost of the drug during the 2-year study period by $95, which would reduce the difference in all costs of direct medical services between the 2 arms to $69, suggesting that an employer would pay approximately $203 to reduce medically related absenteeism by 1 day. When stating the data as relative comparative effectiveness research, our back-of-the-envelope estimates suggest that an employer should encourage the use of atorvastatin if its average daily wage of employees covered in their health plan exceeds approximately $200 per day, provided they receive a 10% discount on the price of atorvastatin.\n\n【20】One policy concern of employers using relative comparative effectiveness research (in the aforementioned manner) is that it might lead to potentially greater health care access disparities between the rich and poor because employers with higher paid employees may be more willing to cover more costly drugs that provide slightly more benefits than employers with lower paid employees. Although this is a possible outcome of using this type of analysis, we think that this already occurs in the United States. It is well documented that there are vast differences in the benefit designs of employer-based health insurance packages across different industries in the United States, and some employers in low-wage industries provide no health insurance. Looking forward, we think that comparative effectiveness research could provide analytical justification to the current drug benefit design used by many employers that place drugs into tiers with different employee deductibles and co-pays. In our example, any employer with average daily wages higher than $200 per day would want to place atorvastatin in the tier that does not have co-pays or deductibles. For employers whose average wage is less than $200 per day, they would want to place atorvastatin in the drug tier that includes the level of co-pays and/or deductibles that would make the comparative effectiveness of atorvastatin vs simvastatin approximately equal to the average daily wage. These employees would purchase atorvastatin if they perceived that the additional health benefits exceeded their out-of-pocket costs.\n\n【21】Of note, the comparative effectiveness research approach allows one to perform some interesting subgroup analyses among employees to determine who benefits the most from a given intervention. For example, is the relative comparative effectiveness of atorvastatin vs simvastatin different between male and female employees? Is it more or less effective for young vs older employees? Subgroup analysis is one of the advantages often highlighted in articles that discuss how comparative effectiveness research could transform medical practice.\n\n【22】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【23】Rethinking randomized clinical trials for comparative effectiveness research: the need for transformational change.\n\n【24】Subgroup analysis adds complexity to the treatment choice for both physicians and patients because it implies that different subgroups of patients could benefit more from alternative treatment choices. In addition, determining these differences using randomized clinical trials would most likely be too costly and take too long to complete. However, once clinical trials have shown a treatment to be safe, retrospective studies using large administrative data sets  provide a rapid and inexpensive approach for identifying potential subgroups that benefit more or less from 1 treatment vs another treatment. For example, with more than 13,000 matched pairs and a 2-year study period, the authors should be able to provide insights concerning which, if any, subgroups of employees benefit the most from being treated with atorvastatin vs simvastatin. Employers and other purchasers of health care should and are beginning to demand answers to such questions. Without the answers that comparative cost analysis can provide, purchasers are blindly spending their health care dollars hoping to help somebody.\n\n【25】In conducting comparative effectiveness research, it is critical to remember that the rules of science still apply.\n\n【26】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【27】The American Heart Association's principles for comparative effectiveness research: a policy statement from the American Heart Association.\n\n【28】Use of nonrandomized data, even after sophisticated statistical analysis, may still be subject to treatment selection bias due to imbalance between the study arms. When this is the case, results may be spurious. In addition, subgroups should be specified in advance when the study is designed because data dredging with multiple comparisons may lead to spurious conclusions. When multiple subgroups are considered with proper statistical approaches that demonstrate that the difference between the subgroups is clinically important and statistically significant, the finding must be interpreted in a critical manner. Comparative effectiveness research will be one part of improving the health care system, but the rules of good science will still apply.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

These data were divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) data sets to robustly determine predictors of NODAT. The long-term survival of patients with NODAT relative to transplant recipients with preexisting diabetes and those without diabetes was assessed.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Increasing age (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; _P_ ≤.001), male sex (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.13; _P_ \\=.03), and obesity (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.08-1.18; _P_ <.001) were significantly associated with NODAT.

Donor features do not affect risk. In addition, sirolimus-based immunosuppression is associated with a significantly higher risk of NODAT than other immunosuppressants. Most importantly, NODAT adversely affects long-term survival after LT in a manner similar to preexisting diabetes, indicating the need for more aggressive care and closer follow-up.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BMI ( body mass index ), LT ( liver transplant ), ML ( machine learning ), mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ), NODAT ( new-onset diabetes after transplant ), OR ( odds ratio ), SRTR ( Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

International normalized ratio values were collected retrospectively for all eligible hemodialysis patients, and TTR was calculated for each period in which the patient was on hemodialysis. Patients who were available and agreed to the intervention underwent targeted dietician review of interacting foods, and their TTR post-treatment was calculated. The median (interquartile range \\[IQR\\]) TTR was 44 (IQR, 29 to 53) % among the 151 patients. Among the 15 patients who underwent the intervention, median (IQR) TTR was 52 (IQR, 32 to 56) pre-intervention and 51 (IQR, 38 to 69) post-intervention ( _P_ \\=0.53). TTR for dialysis patients is low in this overall cohort despite patients being seen at an integrated health care system.

Recent data suggest that dietary factors are responsible for more than 40% of the most common cardiometabolic-related deaths in the United States.\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】Association between dietary factors and mortality from heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes in the United States.\n\n【3】Most of the available evidence investigating the relationship between diet and cardiometabolic diseases, however, largely relies on observational studies that investigate the association between macronutrient and micronutrient consumption with the risk of NCDs, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), many forms of cancer, and cardiovascular (CV) diseases (CVDs). Importantly, such studies often investigate the role of diet in healthy individuals or in those with risk factors, providing evidence related to primordial and primary prevention of NCDs, with little evidence related to secondary prevention. Although the relationship between nutrient consumption and cardiometabolic diseases has been investigated for several macronutrients and micronutrients, the role of dietary fats (ie, saturated fats, unsaturated fats, and trans fats) and carbohydrates (ie, complex carbohydrates and simple carbohydrates) have certainly attracted the most attention.\n\n【4】Simple carbohydrates, also known as sugars, include monosaccharides (ie, glucose, fructose, and galactose) and disaccharides (ie, sucrose \\[glucose plus fructose\\], lactose \\[glucose plus galactose\\], and maltose \\[glucose plus glucose\\]). Initial concerns related to sugars’ potential detrimental role on CV health were raised in the early 1960s.\n\n【5】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【6】Dietary fats, carbohydrates and atherosclerotic vascular disease.\n\n【7】Around the same time, low-fat diets were widely promoted to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD), although this was found to be ineffective 50 years later.\n\n【8】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【9】Low-fat dietary pattern and risk of cardiovascular disease: the Women's Health Initiative Randomized Controlled Dietary Modification Trial.\n\n【10】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【11】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【12】Dietary fats and chronic noncommunicable diseases.\n\n【13】In response to these recommendations, consumers increased consumption of dietary carbohydrates, particularly sugars, which were later found to increase serum lipids, a major risk factor for CHD. To further support this preliminary evidence, a large meta-analysis of prospective studies including 173,753 participants found that sugars in the form of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) were associated with greater risk for CHD, with a 16% relative risk (RR) increase of CHD for each additional daily serving.\n\n【14】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【15】Sugar sweetened beverages consumption and risk of coronary heart disease: a meta-analysis of prospective studies.\n\n【16】More recently, data involving 127,536 individuals from the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professional Follow-up Study confirmed a strong positive association between the intake of food rich in refined starches and added sugars with a 10% RR increase of CHD.\n\n【17】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【18】Saturated fats compared with unsaturated fats and sources of carbohydrates in relation to risk of coronary heart disease: a prospective cohort study.\n\n【19】Conversely, this relationship was not found with food rich in complex carbohydrates (ie, whole grains), which were associated with a 9% RR reduction of CHD,\n\n【20】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【21】Saturated fats compared with unsaturated fats and sources of carbohydrates in relation to risk of coronary heart disease: a prospective cohort study.\n\n【22】thereby supporting the concept that the quality of carbohydrates perhaps matters more than the total amount of carbohydrates. On the other hand, in a prospective study of the Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort, intake of SSBs was not associated with increased CVD (ie, stroke).\n\n【23】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【24】Sugar- and artificially sweetened beverages and the risks of incident stroke and dementia: a prospective cohort study.\n\n【25】With regards to added sugars, an analysis of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that added sugars were associated with a greater risk for CVD mortality; however, the greater increase was particularly evident in the very high quintiles of consumption,\n\n【26】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【27】Added sugar intake and cardiovascular diseases mortality among US adults.\n\n【28】suggesting that unless they reach a large proportion of daily caloric intake, dietary added sugars could be relatively safe, at least from a CVD mortality standpoint.\n\n【29】The lack of appropriately powered randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of such macronutrients on CHD, CVD in general, and CVD-related mortality remains a major concern. Pharmacologic strategies undergo rigorous CV outcomes trials, an approach that is highly encouraged but seldom used in nutrition research.\n\n【30】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【31】Improving the quality of dietary research.\n\n【32】This methodology would allow the identification of a harm threshold for sugars consumption, if one exists.

The elegant analysis assessed the role of individual as well as cumulative reported dietary intake (ie, food frequency questionnaires, 24-hour dietary recall, and 7-day food diaries) of simple carbohydrates, which were divided into total sugars (ie, monosaccharides and disaccharides), added sugars (ie, monosaccharides and disaccharides not naturally present in foods like fruits and fruit juices), and the individual sugars.\n\n【50】The results of the analysis are surprising: as opposed to what many would expect, the consumption of total sugars, sucrose, or fructose, was not associated with a linear dose-response association for the incidence of CVD. The consumption of total sugars and fructose alone were, however, associated with a 9% RR increase and an 8% RR increase in CVD mortality, whereas sucrose presented an inverse association with a 6% RR reduction for CVD mortality, with a 7% RR reduction for each 50-g increase of sucrose consumption. Added sugars were not significantly associated with CVD mortality. Importantly, the authors performed an elegant dose-response analysis of sugars consumption with CVD mortality, and they identified thresholds of 26%, 11%, and 13% of calories deriving from total sugars, fructose, and added sugars respectively, using a predefined amount of 2000-kcal diet. For each additional 50 g of total sugars, fructose, and added sugars consumption after the above described thresholds were reached, RR increases of 17%, 39%, and 17% were found, respectively. Importantly, many of the associations found in the overall population were affected by the sensitivity analyses conducted by the authors, suggesting that the effects of sugars consumption may vary significantly based on the population being investigated.\n\n【51】The study by Khan et al\n\n【52】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【53】Relation of total sugars, sucrose, fructose, and added sugars with the risk of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.\n\n【54】provides novel and provocative findings, which suggest that although sugars may not be associated with the incidence of CVD, a very high level of consumption may be associated with greater CVD-related mortality. In addition, the threshold for harm with regards to CVD mortality identified by the authors for total sugars, fructose, and added sugars are clearly greater than what is recommended by major scientific societies (ie, <10%). The study from Khan et al,\n\n【55】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【56】Relation of total sugars, sucrose, fructose, and added sugars with the risk of cardiovascular disease: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.\n\n【57】if confirmed in randomized controlled trials, has the potential to have a great impact on future dietary recommendations to prevent CVD because the estimated added sugars consumption of the United States adult population is already very close to achieving a consumption below the threshold for harm identified in their study.\n\n【58】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【59】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【60】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【61】Changes in intakes of total and added sugar and their contribution to energy intake in the U.S.\n\n【62】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【63】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【64】In that case, the great effort of reducing dietary sugar to prevent CVD and CVD-related mortality would not be justified by the evidence.

As for most clinical nutrition research and related recommendations from major societies, the evidence heavily relies on observational studies. Prospective randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to determine whether sugars, in fact, cause CVD and CVD mortality, and if yes, understanding the underlying mechanisms would also provide important scientific information.

We report the case of a healthy 31-year-old man who presented to our emergency department with no clinical evidence of an acute coronary event after intravenous injection of amphetamines. However, he subsequently experienced a non–Q-wave anterior wall myocardial infarction associated with the use of amphetamines.\n\n【1】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【2】CK ( creatine kinase ), ECG ( electrocardiogram )\n\n【3】The amphetamines (amphetamine and methamphetamine) are common drugs of abuse. The primary mechanism of action is the release of dopamine and norepinephrine from the presynaptic nerve terminal, leading to the stimulation of peripheral α- and ×-adrenergic receptors. Complications of amphetamine and methamphetamine use may involve several organ systems; however, the most common cardiovascular effects are tachycardia and hypertension. Myocardial infarction is reported rarely after the use of amphetamines. We report the case of a healthy young man who presented to our emergency department after injection of amphetamines, with no symptoms that suggested an ischemic cardiac event. Subsequently, he experienced a non–Q-wave anterior wall myocardial infarction associated with use of amphetamines.\n\n【4】REPORT OF A CASE\n----------------\n\n【5】A 31-year-old man presented to the emergency department because of generalized discomfort after injecting 4 doses of amphetamine and methamphetamine (crank) over a period of 48 hours. The last injected dose was 8 hours before presentation. The patient denied having chest pain, tightness, or shortness of breath. He admitted regular use of amphetamines by both the nasal and the intravenous routes. He denied using other drugs. A history of tobacco use was the only cardiac risk factor.\n\n【6】At presentation the patient's blood pressure was 145/95 mm Hg, heart rate was 112 beats/min, and respirations were 16/min. He was alert with no distress or diaphoresis. Physical examination was remarkable for the presence of venipuncture marks on his arms. Findings on cardiovascular, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) obtained at presentation  demonstrated inverted T waves in leads II, III, aVF, and V <sub>1 </sub> through V <sub>5 </sub> . A second ECG performed within 5 minutes  revealed a new left bundle branch block.\n\n【7】Figure 1 A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained on admission showing inverted T waves in leads II, III, aVF, and V <sub>1 </sub> through V <sub>5 </sub> .\n\n【8】Figure 2 A 12-lead electrocardiogram obtained within 5 minutes of the first  showing a new left bundle branch block.\n\n【9】On admission the patient's total creatine kinase (CK) level was 666 U/L (reference ranges shown parenthetically) (22–269 U/L), with a CK-MB of 12.2 ng/mL (<7 ng/ mL). Intravenous nitroglycerin, subcutaneous enoxaparin, oral clopidogrel, and aspirin were instituted, and he was transferred to the intensive care unit, although he remained asymptomatic with no signs of distress. His CK-MB level decreased to 11 ng/mL and 7.4 ng/mL at 2 and 8 hours after admission, respectively. Troponins were not evaluated.\n\n【10】Transthoracic echocardiography performed on the third day of admission demonstrated reduced anterior wall motion with an estimated shortening fraction of 25%. An ECG obtained that same day showed resolution of the bundle branch block and diffuse T-wave inversion in the inferior and anterolateral leads. No Q waves were noted. Cardiac catheterization was not performed because the patient left the hospital prematurely 4 days after admission.\n\n【11】In 2 urine samples collected at the time of presentation and approximately 12 hours later, amphetamines and methamphetamines were detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Screening of urine for cocaine metabolites, ethanol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone, opiates, phencyclidine, propoxyphene, and tetrahydrocannabinol was negative.\n\n【12】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【13】Amphetamine is a sympathomimetic agent that stimulates catecholamine release, particularly dopamine and norepinephrine, from the presynaptic nerve terminals. Several complications have been associated with acute and chronic use of amphetamines. Tachycardia and hypertension are the most common acute cardiovascular effects.

The mean ± SD age was 36±9 years (range, 25–58 years); 9 (82%) of 11 patients were men. All presented with chest pain or epigastric pain, and ECG changes were noted approximately 1.5±1 hour (range, 1–3 hours) after the use of amphetamines. These changes consisted of ST-segment elevation that dynamically evolved to T-wave inversion and/or abnormal Q waves. Patient 6 had ventricular fibrillation on presentation, underwent defibrillation to sinus rhythm, and subsequently had a favorable outcome. Coronary angiography was performed in 10 patients and revealed nonoccluded coronary arteries in 8. In patient 9, an arteriogram showed a filling defect in the left anterior descending coronary artery, and in patient 11, 90% occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery was found.

The risk-management benefits of informed consent warrant further discussion.\n\n【4】Commencement of a malpractice claim has little to do with whether malpractice occurred.

The magnitude of the injury and the ensuing financial burden will undoubtedly influence a patient's decision to pursue a claim. However, neither catastrophic injuries nor massive economic losses are present in all legal claims. Rather, the common thread in most medical negligence claims is the patient's perception that the physician did something wrong.\n\n【21】In the wake of a medical or surgical complication, a patient's perception of his or her medical care will largely depend on what transpired during the informed consent process. A gap in the informed consent process can cause a patient to believe, incorrectly, that he or she received negligent care.\n\n【22】Consider, for example, a patient who undergoes laparoscopic surgery to repair a ventral hernia. The surgery is thought to have gone well, but the next day the patient's symptoms suggest, and computed tomography confirms, that the patient has a perforated bowel. The patient is taken urgently to the operating room for an open procedure to repair the perforation. The patient now faces prolonged hospitalization, higher medical expenses, and additional time off work. If, at the time of the surgery, the patient did not understand that the surgery entailed a risk of bowel perforation, what will the patient make of the situation? From this unexpected adverse outcome, a patient might infer that the surgeon was negligent. The surgeon might attempt to explain that perforation is a recognized risk of the surgery, known to occur even when all appropriate techniques and precautions are used. The patient could cling to the perception of negligence, interpreting the surgeon's explanation as a post hoc attempt to avoid responsibility for the complication. Alternatively, the patient might accept the explanation as true but grow even more frustrated over not being informed of the risk before the surgery. Either way, the patient believes that the surgeon failed him or her.\n\n【23】Unfortunately, this sequence of events could easily occur in a patient whose chart contains (1) an informed consent form, signed by the patient, detailing the risk of bowel perforation, and (2) a note dictated by the surgeon outlining the informed consent discussion with the patient, including specific mention of the risk of perforation. This “disconnect” between risk information given to patients and risk information understood and retained by patients is well documented. As Paterick et al correctly observe, the informed consent form, by itself, does not constitute informed consent. In fact, patients frequently do not read informed consent forms before signing them.\n\n【24】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【25】Factors affecting quality of informed consent.\n\n【26】Further, a physician's discussion with a patient about treatment-related risks too often does not convey to the patient a firm understanding of those risks. Burns and colleagues\n\n【27】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【28】Informed consent: a patients' perspective.\n\n【29】found that, whereas 90% of the patients in their study were satisfied with the informed consent discussion and considered themselves fully informed, more than 50% of the patients could not list a single treatment-related risk at the time of surgery.\n\n【30】The physician's challenge, therefore, is to communicate more effectively the risks associated with a proposed medical treatment. Paterick et al note that “the dialogue between the patient and physician is the essence of the consent process.” Although this is correct, the dialogue with the patient should not be confused with a mere listing of a string of potential complications. The physician should strive not just to say all the right words, but to impart information and engender in the patient an understanding of the risks to which the patient might be exposed. Although patients generally want their physicians to make recommendations and not just provide options, physicians should encourage patients to be active participants in the decision-making process.\n\n【31】Thus, physicians should aim for their patients to undergo the proposed medical treatment aware of the potential risks but having decided, for themselves, that the potential benefits outweigh the risks. If a complication occurs, patients are less likely to feel blindsided and less likely to draw the incorrect conclusion that the physician was negligent. Further, having decided to undertake the risks associated with the treatment, patients are more likely to accept responsibility for the consequences of that decision than to blame the physician or to feel the physician had strongarmed them into the decision.\n\n【32】Physicians, of course, cannot guarantee that patients will understand and retain information regarding treatment- related risks. In many cases, a careful, unrushed discussion with the patient is sufficient. However, supplementing physician-patient discussions with informational pamphlets or videotaped information has been shown to enhance the transfer and retention of information, particularly for patients with low educational levels.\n\n【33】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【34】Informed consent for total hip arthroplasty: does a written information sheet improve recall by patients?\n\n【35】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【36】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【37】Informed consent for ankle fracture surgery: patient comprehension of verbal and videotaped information.\n\n【38】These results are unsurprising given the generally accepted understanding that individuals' learning preferences vary; some prefer and excel at verbal acquisition whereas others prefer visual acquisition. Provision of both verbal and visual information increases the likelihood that the delivered information will be understood and retained by a particular patient.\n\n【39】In this regard, physicians can benefit from taking a cue from the trial lawyers they undoubtedly wish to avoid. In a malpractice trial, it is essential for attorneys to educate the jurors regarding the complex medical issues involved in the case. This educational process is accomplished verbally, through opening statements, witness testimony, and closing arguments. However, verbal presentation of evidence is supplemented throughout the trial with a variety of visual aids. Medical records and medical illustrations are displayed on large posters or projected on even larger screens. Video presentations show simulations of medical procedures or a typical “day in the life” of the injured plaintiff. This multimedia approach is intended to educate and embed in the minds of jurors information critical to the decision they must make at the conclusion of trial. Similar techniques can prove useful for physicians seeking to inform their patients about decisions they must make.\n\n【40】Risk-management strategies invariably run parallel with good clinical practice. Informed consent is just one example of these shared interests. The effective procurement of informed consent promotes patient autonomy, engenders trust and confidence in medical professionals, and reduces the risk of unnecessary legal claims premised on incorrect assumptions regarding appropriate medical care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

When clinical services are outsourced, however, the outsourcing organization relinquishes control over its most important service value: high-quality patient care. Farming out work to an external service provider can have many unintended results, including inconsistencies in standards of care; harmful medical errors; declines in patient and employee satisfaction; and damage to clinicians’ morale and income, and to the health organization’s culture, reputation, and long-term financial performance. Research on outsourcing in the areas of emergency medicine, radiology, laboratory services, and environmental services provides concerning evidence of potentially large downsides when outsourcing is driven by short-term cost concerns or is planned without diligently considering all of the ramifications of not keeping key clinical and nonclinical services in-house. To better equip health system leaders for decision-making about outsourcing, we examine this body of literature, identify common pitfalls of outsourcing in specific clinical and nonclinical health services and scenarios, explore alternatives to outsourcing, and consider how outsourcing (when necessary) can be done in a strategic manner that does not compromise the values of the organization and its commitment to patients.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CMG ( Contract Management Group ), HAIs ( healthcare-acquired infections ), C. diff ( Clostridium difficile ), MRSA ( methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ), EVS ( environmental services )\n\n【4】Henry, a 6-month-old infant, was admitted to the hospital after acute onset of a fever and signs of sepsis. Empiric vancomycin and ceftriaxone were administered intravenously to rapidly control the infection while Henry’s attending physician waited for blood culture results from an offsite laboratory service provider. The outside lab notified Henry’s doctor that Gram-negative bacteria were growing from the culture — so the vancomycin, generally ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria, was stopped. Henry then developed seizures and respiratory failure, which resulted in his transfer to the pediatric ICU. Subsequent in-hospital culture of cerebrospinal fluid revealed that Henry’s blood culture results were, in fact, mistaken: Gram-positive bacteria had been the source of Henry’s meningitis — so the vancomycin was restarted.

Speed and accuracy in triaging and stabilizing a patient can dictate prognosis. High-quality emergent care is essential for patients and all other stakeholders.

CMGs’ tactics can include reducing costs (often by reducing payroll), raising physician productivity metrics, taking a larger share of physicians’ professional fees to cover overhead expenses than is warranted, and increasing prices and volume of services used.\n\n【92】<sup><a>34</a></sup>\n\n【93】Potential implications of private equity investments in health care delivery.\n\n【94】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【95】<sup><a>35</a></sup>\n\n【96】Corporate and hospital profiteering in emergency medicine: problems of the past, present, and future.\n\n【97】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【98】<sup><a>36</a></sup>\n\n【99】Private equity and physician medical practices — navigating a changing ecosystem.\n\n【100】Emergency medicine appeals to CMGs because it is episodic care requiring minimal follow-up and is well compensated in the US clinical reimbursement system. Moreover, emergency clinicians are more mobile because emergency medicine does not involve ongoing patient care.\n\n【101】To be sure, CMGs can offer an efficient, streamlined means of locating, recruiting, and credentialing staff according to a facility’s unique needs. These features encourage a hospital to consider outsourcing costly, labor-intensive physician recruitment and retention services.\n\n【102】<sup><a>37</a></sup>\n\n【103】Outsourcing medical staffing: hospitals turn to managed-service providers to handle all temporary staffing chores. _Mod Healthc_ 2015.\n\n【104】Hospitals in smaller communities with lower volumes and revenues are especially tempted by CMGs’ apparent potential for reducing staffing costs and addressing the constant challenge of recruiting emergency physicians. Indeed, it is not uncommon for CMGs to use physicians in the emergency department that are not board-certified in emergency medicine — a practice that, in smaller communities, may be necessary whether or not outsourcing is used.\n\n【105】However, as for-profit companies, CMGs have a laser focus on financial performance, potentially encouraging policies that put high-quality care at risk, for example, by establishing aggressive patient-per-hour quotas and rewarding more procedures and ordering of tests that add marginal value and may harm patients.\n\n【106】<sup><a>35</a></sup>\n\n【107】Corporate and hospital profiteering in emergency medicine: problems of the past, present, and future.\n\n【108】Physicians who work for a CMG often have to divide their loyalties between their employer and the outsourcing health system, navigating the two organizations’ different value systems and priorities, which may lead not only to physicians’ conflicted loyalties but also to organizational disunity and poor teamwork — an especially fraught dynamic in a medical specialty that frequently involves life-and-death clinical scenarios. In one study, 34% of CMG-employed emergency physicians reported concerns about losing their job if they raised questions about over-testing, quality of care, or patient treatment — compared with 18% of non-CMG physicians.\n\n【109】<sup><a>38</a></sup>\n\n【110】A survey of emergency physicians regarding due process, financial pressures, and the ability to advocate for patients.\n\n【111】Contract management group physicians in this study also reported experiencing more-frequent pressures to admit to the hospital patients they believed could be treated as outpatients (18% vs 12%) and to discharge or transfer uninsured or medical assistance patients whom they believed should be hospitalized (22% vs 13%).\n\n【112】Given that physician groups not employed by a hospital can opt out of the hospital’s insurance contracts and charge what they wish, outsourcing to an out-of-network physician group often results in higher charges to insurers and patients, sometimes adding up to thousands of dollars per clinical encounter. In a study of nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey for 2001 to 2016, privately insured patients receiving an out-of-network bill for emergency care were charged an average of 10 times more than other emergency patients.\n\n【113】<sup><a>39</a></sup>\n\n【114】Emergency physicians recover a higher share of charges from the out-of-network care than from in-network care.\n\n【115】Sick patients going to an in-network hospital are likely to be unaware when they receive care from an out-of-network provider, which may stun them and their families when they face medical charges they had assumed their insurance would cover.\n\n【116】The two largest PE emergency medicine outsourcing companies are TeamHealth (and its subsidiary Southeastern, both owned by the Blackstone Group) and Envision Healthcare (owned by Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Co.).

A hospital’s reputation is not captured in a financial statement, but it certainly contributes — for better or worse — to the financial bottom line. Dr Tom Scaletta, former president of the American Academy of Emergency Medicine, states, “The principles of great patient care are at odds with maximizing profit.” (personal correspondence, January 14, 2021).\n\n【135】Radiology\n---------\n\n【136】The growth of outsourcing radiology services, primarily through teleradiology, has been driven by a demand for fast-turnaround image interpretation. Beginning with the transmission of radiographic images via telephone lines in 1948, teleradiology has grown rapidly since the 1970s with the advent of magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and positron emission tomography.\n\n【137】<sup><a>45</a></sup>\n\n【138】The empirical foundations of teleradiology and related applications: A review of the evidence.\n\n【139】Approximately 50% of radiologists report interpreting offsite external imaging examinations, services that often are necessary for small and rural health systems that lack resources to employ in-house radiologists around the clock.\n\n【140】<sup><a>46</a></sup>\n\n【141】The current state of teleradiology across the United States: a national survey of radiologists’ habits, attitudes, and perceptions on teleradiology practice.\n\n【142】For these smaller organizations, effective use of teleradiology is a sensible application of outsourcing that can provide access to expert radiological interpretation; reduce patients’ length of stay, rehospitalizations, and transfers to other facilities; and lower the costs of capital and labor.\n\n【143】<sup><a>45</a></sup>\n\n【144】The empirical foundations of teleradiology and related applications: A review of the evidence.\n\n【145】Select radiology services (eg, interpretation of images) are suitable for outsourcing; others (eg, image-guided procedures or any imaging that needs in-person radiologist involvement) are not.\n\n【146】Larger and financially stronger institutions should thoroughly evaluate the decision to outsource, given the potential for negative clinical and business consequences. For example, although radiologists with specialized expertise can offer more value to a case than nonspecialists do, outsourcing companies may use uniform practices that do not distinguish well among radiologists’ skill levels or manage case-complexity assignments accordingly.\n\n【147】<sup><a>47</a></sup>\n\n【148】The commoditization of radiology: are we our own worst enemy?\n\n【149】The European Society of Radiology notes that radiologists provide greater value to patients when they are available for direct consultations with referring physicians and understand the clinical context in which their service is provided.\n\n【150】<sup><a>48</a></sup>\n\n【151】The vanishing radiologist — an unseen danger, and a danger of being unseen. _Eur Radiol._ 2021.\n\n【152】Poor or nonexistent communication between a referring physician and an offsite radiologist can compromise effective and safe care. Moreover, offsite radiologists often lack access to patients’ prior imaging records or medical history, which aids in diagnosis and lowers the risks for interpretation errors and unnecessary further testing. In addition, when remote radiologists cannot attend in-house multidisciplinary meetings, trust is eroded and valuable lessons for future cases may be missed.\n\n【153】<sup><a>49</a></sup>\n\n【154】Teleradiological outsourcing — compromises and hidden costs.\n\n【155】Communication and information-sharing are particularly challenging when outsourcing radiology services because the coordination between parties may not be sequential but reciprocal (ie, requiring ongoing, mutual adjustments across multiple reads). Indeed, outsourcing can exacerbate fragmentation of patient care in radiology. Consider this scenario: Outsourced radiologist A provides screening mammography interpretation; outsourced radiologist B interprets the diagnostic mammography and breast ultrasound scans; and onsite radiologist C performs the image-guided biopsy, with limited, delayed, or even no access to the outsourced radiologists if in-person review and discussion of the case would be helpful.\n\n【156】Physicians employed at organizations that use teleradiology may place less trust in the clinical accuracy of outsourced reports, causing them to spend extra time checking the reports, thereby partially eroding the expected financial savings from outsourcing.\n\n【157】<sup><a>49</a></sup>\n\n【158】Teleradiological outsourcing — compromises and hidden costs.\n\n【159】Such reservations about quality are understandable, as it is challenging to maintain quality standards and accountability for outsourced work. For instance, one for-profit radiology practice serving more than 15 US hospitals signed off on 71,512 radiology reports during an 8-month period, with radiologists viewing only 5840 of those images. Most of the images were reviewed by radiology practitioner assistants, who were inexpensive to hire but not fully qualified to review images or provide accurate diagnoses, putting at risk thousands of patients as well as the reputations of clinicians and the hospital that approved these services.\n\n【160】<sup><a>50</a></sup>\n\n【161】U.S.A. v.

Larger firms also can spread the fixed costs of technology investments over their larger volume of business. As in the case of emergency medicine and radiology, the economics and technical complexity of laboratory testing give outsourcing an especially strong appeal to smaller hospitals. Yet, like these other services, outsourcing laboratory testing requires careful due diligence in comparing the potential benefits and drawbacks.\n\n【173】This article’s opening story about “Henry” is not about any particular laboratory’s shortcomings, but it illustrates the broader significance of decisions to outsource laboratory services.\n\n【174】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【175】Medical errors arising from outsourcing laboratory and radiology services.\n\n【176】Indeed, outsourcing may lead to adverse outcomes such as poor turnaround times for test reports, compromised specimens, incorrect tests, and problems with courier services.\n\n【177】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【178】Outsourcing of academic clinical laboratories: experiences and lessons from the association of pathology chairs laboratory outsourcing survey.\n\n【179】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【180】<sup><a>53</a></sup>\n\n【181】What do you want from your reference laboratory?

Viewing EVS as a relatively low-skill and easily implemented service can make outsourcing appear to be a smart solution. And it may be — but only if the right company is selected to perform the service. After all, EVS workers play an essential but often underappreciated role in patient safety. Nevertheless, funding for cleaning has continued to be cut since the mid-1990s, contributing to chronic understaffing and a rise in HAIs, including surgical-site infections.\n\n【224】<sup><a>64</a></sup>\n\n【225】Cleaning up: how hospital outsourcing is hurting workers and endangering patients.\n\n【226】ILR Press/Cornell University Press , Ithaca, NY 2013\n\n【227】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【228】<sup><a>65</a></sup>\n\n【229】Superbugs versus outsourced cleaners: employment arrangements and the spread of health care–associated infections.\n\n【230】New staff may be trained for just a few days.

Another concern is if employed EVS workers feel more responsibility to report cleaning-process deficiencies than outsourced workers do. Outsourcing EVS can limit hospitals’ control over cleanliness and increases the risk of needlessly exposing patients (and others, including staff) to dangerous infections.\n\n【246】Big Decision, Big Questions, Big Risks\n--------------------------------------\n\n【247】Outsourcing in health care has become increasingly common as administrators seek to improve profitability, efficiency, and quality. However, a careful examination of four services that directly affect the quality of patient care illustrates the potential risks of transferring responsibility for performing clinically relevant services to outside organizations. The more the outsourced service affects value and quality, the greater the risks to the outsourcing organization. Although a primary goal of outsourcing is cost efficiency, the resulting financials often do not meet expectations, especially if the indirect costs of lower quality are accurately calculated as contributing to poor outcomes such as medical errors, loss of employees’ trust, and increased hospital readmissions.\n\n【248】<sup><a>69</a></sup>\n\n【249】Improving patient handovers from hospital to primary care. a systematic review.\n\n【250】Lower quality also damages an organization’s reputation and can adversely affect referral patterns, patients’ comments on social media, and even hospital accreditation. In addition, the outsourcing of health care work can weaken employee morale, team effectiveness, confidence in management, and organizational culture.\n\n【251】Another point to consider is whether to have the outsourced service conducted onsite or offsite. Surprisingly little research has compared these two general outsourcing strategies, and how and when each should be used.\n\n【252】<sup><a>70</a></sup>\n\n【253】Human Resources Transformation Beyond Boundaries in Outsourcing Business Model - Expatriate Benchmarking.\n\n【254】Outsourcing clearly does have the potential to create value in certain health care situations. Service providers may see an opportunity to benefit from another organization’s deep expertise and consolidated volume, achieving the scale required to provide a service efficiently and effectively. But outsourcing must be used for the right reasons and the right services with the right partners — and with the right guidelines, interorganizational communications, and monitoring in place to further a health system’s long-term success rather than risk diminishing it. When outsourcing is pursued to achieve short-term (usually financial) goals, long-term problems can ensue, including some that diminish the expected financial returns on investment.\n\n【255】Effective outsourcing requires that health systems maintain substantive oversight of the performance of the outsourced services. Transferring control of service performance to another organization need not result in relinquishing valuable influence. This is best accomplished with a “one organization” mindset, whereby a health system makes every effort to contract only with outsourcing entities whose core values and long-term goals are compatible so that the two organizations function as one and continually enhance their alignment.\n\n【256】Concerted efforts also should be made to integrate outsourced staff with insourced staff by, for example, including the former in hospital-community engagement activities, professional development programs, morbidity and mortality meetings, grand rounds sessions, organization-wide communications, and organizational celebratory events. Detailed contracts are standard practice in outsourcing and should include performance metrics such as indicators of clinical quality, business efficiency, patient satisfaction, and professionalism. However, if contracts are well crafted with regular audits and their terms well communicated — and if the right outsourcing partner is selected — the need to enforce compliance should be rare.\n\n【257】We urge health system executives to clearly articulate the outcomes they seek to achieve and diligently consider the following questions before embarking on an outsourcing arrangement:\n\n【258】*   Will our patients benefit — and in ways they can perceive?\n\n【259】*   Will we enhance patient safety?\n\n【260】*   Will our employees benefit — or at least not be adversely affected?\n\n【261】*   Will our third-party payers benefit?\n\n【262】*   Will we strengthen our overall capabilities as we pursue a broader organizational strategy?\n\n【263】*   Will we increase our organization’s flexibility and innovation?\n\n【264】*   Will we bolster our organization’s reputation and brand?\n\n【265】*   Will we improve our long-term, not merely our short-term, financial performance?\n\n【266】Alternatives to Outsourcing\n---------------------------\n\n【267】It is clear that all decisions to outsource pose some combination of risks to an organization. Hospital executives must consider the associated risks, including the organization’s capacity for change and the relative maturity of the outsourcing market in a particular function. When deciding whether to outsource a specific service, executives should always assess the potential consequences, as all outsourcing involves some risks . Deliberate efforts to weigh those risks against the expected benefits can help to mitigate the risk exposure.\n\n【268】<sup><a>71</a></sup>\n\n【269】COVID-19 and medical education: a four-part model to assess risks, benefits and institutional obligations during a global pandemic.\n\n【270】Table 2 Levels of Risk to Hospitals When They Outsource Various Types of Services\n\n| Level 1Nonclinical services (low risk) | Level 2Support services (medium risk) | Level 3Select clinical and support services (medium–high risk) | Level 4Patient-facing clinical services (high risk) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| LaundryFood and concessionsCoding reviewsRevenue-enhancement servicesPatient transportProcurementSecurityGardening and ground management | Laboratory (pathology and microbiology)Information technology servicesData analyticsMedical facilities managementTraining and education services | Diagnostic imaging service linesEnvironmental servicesPharmacySurgery equipment sterilizationDialysisPathologyNeuromonitoringCybersecurity | Emergency medicineCardiologyAnesthesiaMental health servicesPhysiotherapy and rehabilitationSurgeryCritical care servicesHospitalists |\n\n【272】Outsourcing may be more beneficial in some sections or departments than in others, but the decision should be made by hospital management, not an outside party, especially when that party has a vested interest in the outcome. One particular risk is that a vendor may stop being able to provide the service, perhaps because it underbid a contract, which it later finds itself unable to honor, or for other reasons. Although the costs of keeping a departmental function in-house may seem to outweigh the risk of an outsourcing vendor’s unexpected exit or default, due-diligence research on the vendor’s long-term viability and commitment is essential. After all, the costs of reintegrating an outsourced service in-house can be substantial. An alternative to outsourcing whole departments is to outsource specific tasks that another company may accomplish more efficiently. For instance, rather than outsourcing its entire billing department, California’s ValleyCare Health System outsourced specific billing tasks that were valued under $3000. ValleyCare found that outsourcing these smaller tasks was the more cost-effective approach.\n\n【273】<sup><a>72</a></sup>\n\n【274】To outsource or not to outsource. _Healthcare Inn._ 2011.\n\n【275】Smaller hospitals’ cashflow problems may make outsourcing the only viable option for certain services. These hospitals may consider teaming up with other nearby smaller hospitals to collectively garner more buying power and innovation capacity. Such a hospital group, for example, could invest in its own shared laboratory services department to better control costs and maintain high quality. One example of a multisystem shared laboratory joint venture is North Carolina-based Spectrum Laboratory Network, owned by Forsyth Memorial Hospital, Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital, and High Point Regional Health System; combined, these systems represent 2200 hospital beds. Another such venture is Virginia-based Shared Laboratory Services, owned by Chesapeake General Hospital, DePaul Medical Center, Obici Medical Center, Virginia Beach General Hospital, and American Medical Laboratory; American Medical Laboratory also is the reference laboratory for the shared lab company. The needs to reduce costs and eliminate unused core lab capacity will drive the creation of shared lab organizations, and the need to introduce and manage new diagnostic technology will make them increasingly important to health care.\n\n【276】Another alternative to traditional outsourcing arose during the COVID-19 pandemic response in New York City (and elsewhere), whereby private, public, and community hospital systems collaborated with one another. Despite variation in organizational and financial structures across these hospital systems, they were able to share vital resources during the crisis, with a particular focus on critical care physicians and nurses, as well as key equipment.\n\n【277】<sup><a>73</a></sup>\n\n【278】Collaborating across private, public, community, and federal hospital systems: lessons learned from the covid-19 pandemic response in NYC. _NEJM Catalyst Innovations in Care Delivery._ 2021.\n\n【279】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【280】Health care is a unique and consequential service, and the decision to outsource should never be taken lightly. Patients must be at the center of care decisions, including those that pertain to how health services are delivered to them; after all, patients are the primary focus of the care being given. When outsourcing is used, efforts to work closely with the service provider can mitigate miscommunication and frustration, while nurturing trust and alignment between the two parties. The secondary aim of pursuing net revenue should itself take a long-term view that accounts for all potential high-stakes downsides of outsourcing core health care services. Only then will a health care organization avoid the greatest risks of outsourcing — and deploy it only when it is truly the best option for the institution itself, its staff, its third-party payers, and the patients it aims to serve with excellence.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Kettering—Medical Philanthropist and Inventor\nAlthough the American engineer Charles Frederick Kettering is known primarily for his contributions to the development and evolution of the automobile, he also made valuable contributions to medicine and science. As a philanthropist, in 1927 he established the C. F. Kettering Foundation for the Study of Chlorophyll and Photosynthesis at Antioch College (Yellow Springs, Ohio), and in 1945, in collaboration with American industrialist Alfred Pritchard Sloan (1875-1966), he funded the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research at the Memorial Cancer Center in New York City. As an inventor, Kettering designed and built the “Kettering hypertherm,” a device used to treat neurosyphilis (syphilis of the brain) by intensely heating the body.\n\n【1】Charles F. Kettering was born on August 29, 1876, on a farm near Loudonville in north central Ohio (15 miles southeast of Mansfield). He attended a small district school near his home and the high school in Loudonville. After graduating from high school, he enrolled at Wooster Normal School in Wooster, Ohio, and at the age of 19 years, he became a country schoolteacher at Bunker Hill, Ohio. He taught for 1 year and then left to attend Ohio State University in Columbus. However, after completing his freshman year, he left school for 2 years because of an eye ailment. During this time, he worked for the Star Telephone Company in Ashland, Ohio (13 miles northeast of Mansfield). After this 2-year interval, Kettering reentered Ohio State University and graduated with a degree in electrical engineering at 27 years of age.\n\n【2】After he received his engineering degree, Kettering joined the National Cash Register Company (NCR) in Dayton, Ohio, where he became director of a research group. While at NCR, he invented the first electric cash register and was named chief of research and development.\n\n【3】In 1909 Kettering left NCR and, with Edward Andrew Deeds (died in 1960), an NCR executive, founded the Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company (Delco), to design automobile electrical equipment and to develop their recently invented automobile battery ignition system. As part of this system, Kettering designed the storage battery, the voltage regulator, the generator, and the first electric starter (1911), which was introduced in Cadillacs in 1912. Electric starters eliminated the need to manually crank an engine to start it. While at Delco, Kettering also developed the Delco light, a self-contained light and power unit for farms and other places that did not have access to power lines.\n\n【4】In 1916 Delco became a subsidiary of United Motors Corporation, later (1919) General Motors (GM). Kettering remained with Delco and served as vice president and director of research for GM from 1920 to 1947. In 1925 he moved to Detroit, Michigan, to form GM Research Corporation, later known as the Research Laboratories Division of the General Motors Corporation. After his retirement in 1947, he remained as a consultant.\n\n【5】In 1914 Kettering founded the Dayton Wright Airplane Corporation, which during World War I (1914-1918) designed and built a self-guided aerial torpedo. This was a small monoplane with a highly explosive warhead and automatic controls—a direct precursor of the cruise missile. During the war, Kettering also manufactured airplane ignition systems and developed synthetic aircraft fuel.\n\n【6】Kettering's inventions covered many diverse fields. He contributed to the development of safety glass, crankcase ventilation systems, 4-wheel drive brakes, the nontoxic refrigerant Freon-12 (developed for GM's Frigidaire subsidiary), a process for extracting bromine from sea water, and quick-drying lacquers (for painting automobiles). In 1921 he also contributed to the development of antiknock fuels and leaded gasoline by the addition of tetraethyl lead, and in 1923 he coined the word _Ethyl_ for high-octane gasoline. His work with high-octane fuels was in collaboration with the American chemist Thomas Midgley, Jr (1889-1944). In addition, Kettering developed a high-speed, 2-cycle diesel engine for trains. In 1951 he developed a revolutionary high-compression automobile engine, a V-8 engine (the Kettering Engine).\n\n【7】Kettering held more than 185 patents and was awarded honorary degrees from 29 educational institutions, including doctorates from Northwestern University, New York University, Columbia University, and Harvard University. Among his many honors was being elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\n【8】On November 25, 1958, at the age of 82 years, Charles Frederick Kettering died in Dayton, Ohio.

Faced with this increase, clinicians need a better understanding of what an elevated serum creatinine level represents and a simple codified approach to evaluating renal failure. Creatinine, a muscle waste product, has an imperfect but predictable association with the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Although other markers of GFR exist, including cystatin C, urea, inulin, and radioisotopic methods, their role in estimating GFR remains a matter for debate, especially that of cystatin C. Diagnosis and management of CKD are challenges for the nonspecialist. We describe a systematic approach that can be used by the nonspecialist to identify most but not all causes of renal insufficiency. Although this approach should allow for earlier recognition of treatable causes of CKD, it does not eliminate the involvement of a nephrologist in the care and management of the conditions causing the renal insufficiency. The nonspecialist should also be able to recognize the 9 therapies that are helpful in preservation of renal function in all patients with CKD.\n\n【1】CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), FENa ( fractional excretion of sodium ), GFR ( glomerular filtration rate ), NSAID ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ), RBC ( red blood cell )\n\n【2】**C** hronic kidney disease (CKD), as defined by a reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is increasing in the United States,\n\n【3】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【4】Spectrum of renal failure in elderly patients.\n\n【5】in part because of the greater prevalence of obesity and hypertension\n\n【6】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【7】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【8】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【9】Trends in hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control in older U.S. adults: data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1988 to 2004.\n\n【10】but in greater part because of improved longevity. Because GFR declines 1% per year for every year of life after the third decade, living longer means that it is possible to outlive one's renal function and to require renal replacement therapy to stay alive.

To use the serum creatinine level as a marker of renal function, creatinine production and protein intake must be assumed to be constant . Creatinine excretion is due not only to filtration (90%-95%) by the kidney but also to secretion (5%-10%) by the distal tubule. As GFR decreases, the percentage of creatinine excretion due to secretion increases. In this circumstance, substances that block distal tubule secretion of creatinine (eg, trimethoprim, cimetidine, cefoxitin, flucytosine) may cause the serum creatinine level to increase abruptly, when in fact GFR has not changed at all.\n\n【30】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【31】A rise in plasma creatinine that is not a sign of renal failure: which drugs can be responsible?\n\n【32】Because they can confuse the assessment of kidney function, these agents are often avoided in the patient with CKD. Glomerular filtration rate can be estimated by measuring creatinine clearance using serum creatinine levels and a timed urine specimen. However, measuring creatinine clearance is time-consuming and fraught with errors of timing and collection, so other methods of estimating GFR, both those that rely on determining serum creatinine levels and those that do not, have been sought to replace the measured creatinine clearance.\n\n【33】FIGURE Balance between muscle production and renal excretion of serum creatinine. As the glomerular filtration rate decreases, the percentage of creatinine excreted via secretion increases.\n\n【34】Multiple formulas exist to estimate renal function accurately by correcting for such factors as differences in muscle mass in men vs women or in African American vs white people and changes in muscle mass due to aging. The most commonly used are the Cockroft-Gault equation\n\n【35】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【36】Prediction of creatinine clearance from serum creatinine.\n\n【37】and the 4-variable and 6-variable Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)\n\n【38】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【39】A more accurate method to estimate glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine: a new prediction equation.\n\n【40】equations. Rule et al\n\n【41】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【42】Limitations of estimating glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine in the general population.\n\n【43】have argued that, because these formulas are derived from patients with renal disease, they may not predict renal function as well in patients without renal disease. Most clinicians use the MDRD equation because of its availability on the Internet, where one can simply plug in values for age, weight, race, and sex to receive an estimated GFR. It should be recognized that all these formulas have wide confidence intervals such that small changes in true GFR are hard to detect by this method.\n\n【44】An alternative serum marker, cystatin C, has been proposed as a marker of GFR.\n\n【45】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【46】Glomerular filtration rate estimated by cystatin C among different clinical presentations.\n\n【47】Cystatin C, an endogenous cysteine protease inhibitor, is freely filtered by the kidney and unaffected by renal tubules. However, serum levels are more variable than for creatinine, and the fact that serum levels can be affected by acute disease (malignancy, infection with human immunodeficiency virus) has left cystatin C without a defined role in clinical medicine. Estimates of GFR can be obtained from radioisotope and short clearance studies using infused substances, such as inulin or iothalamate.\n\n【48】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【49】How to measure renal function in clinical practice.\n\n【50】These tests, which are too complex for regular clinical use, are not required because the estimated GFR serves the clinician well in most circumstances. Their primary clinical function is to help define whether a patient is at end-stage renal disease. All these estimates of renal function are harder to interpret during acute renal failure, which is characterized by an unstable association between creatinine production and renal excretion (changing renal function).\n\n【51】Where does the primary care physician find the previous measurements of serum creatinine levels that are needed to interpret the current value correctly? Sources of baseline serum creatinine values include laboratory work performed during previous physician visits, minor surgeries (appendix, tonsillectomy), physical examinations at the work-place or for purposes of insurance, and school or sports physical examinations, during which routine urinalysis is often performed to help ascertain the onset of kidney disease (proteinuria or microhematuria). Once it has been determined that the elevated serum creatinine level represents CKD, an effective approach is needed for identifying why such an increase occurred.\n\n【52】TYPES OF RENAL FAILURE\n----------------------\n\n【53】The first task in evaluating the patient with an elevated creatinine level is to categorize the patient's clinical presentation as 1 of 3 possible types of renal failure: postrenal failure, prerenal azotemia, or intrinsic renal failure.\n\n【54】### Postrenal Failure\n\n【55】The astute clinician will always start with this mechanism of renal failure because it may be the most reversible form of renal failure and should never go undiagnosed. The first and most common type of postrenal failure is _obstructive uropathy_ . Obstructive uropathy can be caused by _intrinsic_ obstruction of urinary flow (eg, stone, tumor, blood clot, or papillary necrosis) or by _extrinsic_ obstruction (eg, postoperative, prostatic hypertrophy, retroperitoneal fibrosis, retroperitoneal tumor \\[lymphoma or metastatic disease\\]). The second and much less common form of postrenal failure is _renal vein thrombosis._\n\n【56】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【57】Clinical characteristics and long-term follow-up of patients with renal vein thrombosis.\n\n【58】Renal vein thrombosis can present as acute kidney failure with flank pain and gross hematuria. Renal vein thrombosis may also present as a chronic condition without the dramatic acute symptoms, often in the setting of glomerulonephritis. In adults, it usually occurs in association with a coagulopathy from an acute illness, such as metastatic malignancy or acute glomerulonephritis. Renal vein thrombosis is more common in children than adults and is associated with diseases that cause volume contraction.\n\n【59】### Prerenal Azotemia\n\n【60】Prerenal azotemia, another of the reversible forms of CKD, results from a reduction in perfusion to the kidney that leads to renal dysfunction and an elevated serum creatinine level. It can be characterized by events such as acute renal artery embolism, dissection, and thrombosis; however, it is more commonly associated with other causes of decreases in effective circulating volume . In many patients with CKD, a prerenal component presents as a furtherincrease in serum creatinine levels from previous baseline values. History and physical examination are critical for identifying prerenal azotemia. The clinician should seek evidence in the patient's history of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, new use or increased dose of diuretics, unexpected resolution of long-standing edema, weight loss, or orthostatic symptoms. During the examination, lying and standing blood pressure and pulse are the most important tools to evaluate for extracellular volume depletion. Chronic heart failure, liver disease, and the nephrotic syndrome have the appearance of volume overload (eg, edema, rales, abdominal fluid wave), yet the kidney behaves as if there were volume depletion, potentially resulting in an elevated serum creatinine level.\n\n【61】TABLE 1 Causes of Prerenal Azotemia\n\n| Low cardiac outputAcute myocardial infarctionChronic heart failureValvular heart diseaseDecreased plasma volumeDiarrheaVomitingSweatingNasogastric suctionBurnsDiureticsDecreased hemoglobin levelsBleedingEndocrine dysfunctionUncontrolled diabetes mellitus (polyuria)Diabetes insipidusAddison diseaseRenal dysfunctionSalt-wasting nephropathyVasodilationSepsis syndromeEndotoxemia |\n| --- |\n\n【63】A number of urinary markers, among which fractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is the most prominent, have been proposed for identifying the patient with _oliguric_ prerenal azotemia.\n\n【64】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【65】The FENa test: use in the differential diagnosis of acute renal failure.\n\n【66】However, in some circumstances, FENa may be falsely low, suggesting prerenal azotemia, when it is not the cause of the elevated serum creatinine level. Such is the case among patients with glomerulonephritis, myoglobinuric renal failure, contrast-induced nephropathy, renal allograft rejection, acute interstitial nephritis, or urinary tract obstructions and among patients who have been prescribed diuretics to augment urine output.\n\n【67】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【68】Diagnostic performance of fractional excretion of urea and fractional excretion of sodium in the evaluations of patients with acute kidney injury with or without diuretic treatment.\n\n【69】Because FENa may be falsely low in some patients and because many hours may be required to obtain the data needed for its calculation, a thorough history and examination are favored for detecting volume contraction over the FENa. Other laboratory findings that may aid in the diagnosis of prerenal azotemia include elevated levels of serum uric acid and serum calcium and an increase in the ratio of blood urea nitrogen to serum creatinine to more than 20.\n\n【70】### Intrinsic Renal Failure\n\n【71】The third and final cause of an elevated serum creatinine level involves disease of the renal tissue itself. There are 3 types of tissue in the kidney: glomerular tissue (primary glomerular disease; secondary glomerular diseases due to other conditions \\[eg, systemic vasculitis, diabetes, hypertension, amyloidosis\\]); vascular tissue, which may be affected by systemic vasculitides, atheroemboli, and thromboemboli; and interstitial tissues, which can be damaged by sickle cell anemia, chronic analgesic use, and certain medications (eg, antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, NSAIDs).\n\n【72】As Table 2 shows, one can begin to identify which type of renal parenchymal problem is present with 4 pieces of simple information: findings on urine microscopy, results of a 24-hour protein excretion test, presence of hypertension, and time course of the elevated serum creatinine level.\n\n【73】TABLE 2 Evaluation of Intrinsic Renal Failure\n\n【74】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【75】OFB = oval fat body; RBC = red blood cell.\n\n|  | Glomerular | Vascular | Interstitial |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Urinalysis | RBC cast, OFB ; fatty cast | RBC cast | None |\n| 24-h protein excretion (g/d/1.73m 2 ) | \\>3.5 | 1-5 | <2 |\n| Hypertension | 50% | 75% | Rare |\n| Rate of increase in serum creatinine level | 5-10 y | <1 y | \\>15-20 y |\n\n【77】a OFB = oval fat body; RBC = red blood cell.\n\n【78】**Urine Microscopy.** Urine microscopy, the “poor man's renal biopsy,” provides valuable information only if the urine specimen is fresh (<20 minutes from voiding) and is analyzed by a physician (ie, a nephrologist) who is able to recognize red blood cell (RBC) casts. At any clinical laboratory, urine samples are analyzed in batch form; by the time a technician looks at the specimen, the cast will have degraded and be undetectable. The presence of more than 25 dysmorphic RBCs is a common surrogate for RBC casts. Red blood cells that have traversed the glomerular basement membrane to reach the urinary space (glomerulonephritis) will have a distorted appearance because of that transit. In contrast, RBCs entering the urine from other parts of the urinary tract will not be distorted and so will be unimorphic. Although the use of this surrogate is accepted practice, careful evaluation shows that dysmorphic RBCs are no more suggestive of glomerulonephritis than is plain hematuria in the presence of substantial proteinuria.\n\n【79】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【80】Dysmorphism of urinary red blood cells—value in diagnosis.\n\n【81】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【82】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【83】Refined microscopic urinalysis for red blood cell morphology in the evaluation of asymptomatic microscopic hematuria in a pediatric population.\n\n【84】This point is critical because urinary microscopy aids identification of the type of renal disease only by showing whether RBC casts (nephritis) or oval fat bodies, fatty casts, and free fat (nephrosis) are present. As shown in Table 2 , RBC casts are seen in glomerular disease and vasculitis of the kidney but not in interstitial disease. All other findings of urine microscopy—eg, ropey casts, hyaline casts, waxy casts, renal tubular epithelial cells—are nonspecific reflectors of renal disease and are of no help to the clinician in determining the specific cause of CKD.\n\n【85】**24-Hour Urinary Protein Excretion Test.** By definition, 24-hour urinary protein excretion in patients with glomerular disease (eg, nephrotic syndrome) is at least 3.5 g/d per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> but can be much higher. Although substantial proteinuria (1-5 g/d per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ) is often associated with vasculitis, proteinuria is more pronounced in primarily glomerular forms of renal disease. Interstitial renal disease usually presents with little or no proteinuria; however, up to 2 g of urinary protein, primarily tubular or Tamm-Horsfall protein, may be excreted daily.\n\n【86】**Hypertension.** Hypertension, especially when it occurs early in the course of renal failure, can be useful in evaluating intrinsic forms of kidney disease. Most patients with vasculitis of the kidney will have hypertension, often severe. Early in the disease process, patients with glomerulonephritis are slightly less likely to be hypertensive than those with vasculitis. Patients with interstitial forms of renal disease develop hypertension only as they near end-stage renal disease.\n\n【87】**Time Course of Increase in Serum Creatinine Level.** When available, the time course of the increase in the serum creatinine level is very helpful in identifying the type of renal disease causing its elevation. When left untreated, vasculitis of the kidney and diseases such as Goodpasture syndrome, Wegener granulomatosis, and lupus vasculitis rapidly progress to renal failure, reaching end stage or requiring dialytic support within weeks or months of the beginning of the disease. Although untreated glomerulonephritis may have a rapid course, renal failure usually develops more slowly, with low levels of GFR reached in a period of 2 to 10 years. Interstitial renal disease has a more indolent course, reaching low levels of GFR only after 10 to 20 years. However, a rapidly increasing serum creatinine level is possible with allergic interstitial nephritis and acute tubular necrosis.\n\n【88】EVALUATION OF THE PATIENT\n-------------------------\n\n【89】### History\n\n【90】In taking the history of a patient with CKD, the clinician should attempt to determine when the onset of proteinuria and hypertension occurred and whether previous serum creatinine tests have been performed. Patients should also be questioned regarding voiding symptoms, such as hesitancy, decreased stream strength, or intermittent large and small voiding amounts, because these symptoms suggest obstructive uropathy. Every patient with an elevated serum creatinine level should be asked if they have a history of diabetes, arthritis, or medication exposure. Almost all NSAIDs, including over-the-counter forms and almost all antibiotics, have been reported to cause renal failure in at least 1 case report.\n\n【91】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【92】Drug-induced renal failure: update on new medications and unique mechanisms of nephrotoxicity.\n\n【93】In fact, no NSAID can be declared “safe” with regard to renal failure. Previous use of chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin,\n\n【94】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【95】Drug-induced renal failure: update on new medications and unique mechanisms of nephrotoxicity.\n\n【96】or history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and proton pump inhibitor use\n\n【97】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【98】Acute kidney injury following proton pump inhibitor therapy.\n\n【99】should be identified. Recent radiographic studies using radiocontrast agents\n\n【100】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【101】Renal failure in 57 925 patients undergoing coronary procedures using iso-osmolar or low-osmolar contrast media.\n\n【102】should also be considered when attempting to identify possible causes of an elevated serum creatinine level.\n\n【103】### Diagnostic Examination\n\n【104】The diagnostic examination for the patient with renal failure includes a few unique items. First, to test for prerenal azotemia, lying and standing blood pressure and pulse should be recorded. Funduscopic examination for findings of hypertension (Keith-Wagener-Barker\n\n【105】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【106】Diffuse arteriolar disease with hypertension and the associated retinal lesions.\n\n【107】) and diabetic changes should be performed. The ability to view the nondilated fundus is greatly enhanced with the use of a specially designed ophthalmoscope (PanOptic; Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, NY).\n\n【108】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【109】Welch Allyn Product Catalogue Web site. Eye, Ear, Nose & Throat.\n\n【110】During an examination specific to a diagnosis of increasing serum creatinine levels, the clinician should also check for evidence of volume overload (rales, third heart sound, lower-extremity edema), joint effusions or erythema, and splinter hemorrhages, as well as palpate for distended bladder above the symphysis pubis.\n\n【111】### Laboratory Testing\n\n【112】**Standard.** Consider testing for creatinine phosphokinase and aldolase levels to determine that the elevated serum creatinine level retains its validity as a marker of renal function and does not reflect increased creatinine production (eg, rhabdomyolysis).\n\n【113】The standard work-up also includes a physician-performed urinalysis; measurement of levels of serum creatinine (usually with a full electrolyte panel), creatinine, and serum cholesterol (nephrotic syndrome); and a 24-hour urinary protein excretion test.\n\n【114】**Subspecialty Evaluation.** To determine whether systemic illness is the cause of renal disease, an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody panel, serum and urine protein electrophoresis, and fat aspiration for amyloidosis may be performed, as should serologic tests to determine C3 and C4 complement levels and to check for the presence of anti-nuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, antiglomerular basement membrane antibody, and cryoglobulins. Although commonly performed, these tests only rarely reveal a systemic disease thought to be present without the serologic evidence, and even positive serologic findings do not obviate the need for renal biopsy.\n\n【115】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【116】Routine serologic tests in the differential diagnosis of the adult nephrotic syndrome.\n\n【117】However, positive serologic findings may make physicians more comfortable in recommending a renal biopsy. Although most renal biopsies are without incident, 50% of the patient's GFR could be lost if refractory bleeding requires nephrectomy.\n\n【118】### Radiography\n\n【119】Renal ultrasonography with arterial Doppler studies is the single most important test for evaluating all patients with an elevated creatinine level. First and most importantly, it is the least invasive method for identifying obstructive uropathy, the most reversible form of renal failure. Second, it provides information on renal size. If the kidneys are smaller than 7 to 8 cm, then the likelihood of a reversible form of renal failure is extremely low. Large kidneys (>12-13 cm) have a specific differential diagnosis, including reversible conditions such as acute glomerulonephritis, infiltrative diseases of the kidney (leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin disease, multiple myeloma, and amyloidosis), andconditions without reversibility such as diabetic nephropathy, polycystic kidney disease, and obstruction. The Doppler component helps identify patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis, whose renal function would benefit from successful angioplasty.\n\n【120】PRESERVING RENAL FUNCTION IN CKD\n--------------------------------\n\n【121】Regardless of the renal process, patients with renal failure can and should be managed aggressively with a 9-pronged approach . If primary care physicians actively pursue this approach, they can substantially reduce the rate of GFR decline and delay the need for dialysis or renal transplant. Aggressive blood pressure reduction has always been shown to protect the kidney from further damage. The use of antihypertensive agents with antiproteinuric properties is also important but does _not_ supersede the need to reach goal blood pressure. When blood pressure is well controlled, additional therapy (adding an angiotensin receptor blocker to an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or increasing doses of either) with resultant reduction in quantitative proteinuria has also been found to benefit patients with CKD and proteinuric renal disease.\n\n【122】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【123】Treatment of the patient with diabetes mellitus and risk of nephropathy: what do we know, and what do we need to learn?\n\n【124】Good diabetes control can slow the rate of progression of diabetic nephropathy. Reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to less than 100 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) not only reduces the risk of vascular disease, which is very high in these patients, but also provides some degree of renal protection.\n\n【125】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【126】Statins for Improving renal outcomes: a meta-analysis.\n\n【127】Although the low-protein diet has never been shown to be beneficial in reducing the rate of GFR decline in humans,\n\n【128】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【129】Eleven reasons to control the protein intake of patients with chronic kidney disease.\n\n【130】it is often still recommended. The low-protein diet is counterintuitive as a means of slowing the rate of GFR decline: if patients reduce their protein intake, they replace that caloric intake with fat and glucose that accelerate their vascular disease development.\n\n【131】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【132】Dietary factors that promote or retard inflammation.\n\n【133】Unless they refuse dialysis or transplant, patients do not die of renal failure; however, they do die of acute myocardial infarction or stroke, often before reaching end-stage renal disease,\n\n【134】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【135】Cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk hypertensive patients stratified by baseline glomerular filtration rate.\n\n【136】and thus the American Heart Association diet, which is low in fat and salt (for blood pressure control), is preferred. Patients with renal disease may be overwhelmed with the many major modifications in lifestyle that they are asked to make. By focusing their attention on the most important modifications, such as smoking cessation, and deemphasizing low-priority modifications, such as the low-protein diet, better results may be obtained.\n\n【137】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【138】The two best reasons NOT to focus on protein restriction in chronic kidney disease \\[letter\\].\n\n【139】TABLE 3 Preservation of Kidney Function: 9-Pronged Approach\n\n【140】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【141】LDL-C = low-density hpoprotein cholesterol; NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.\n\n| 1.Control hypertensionTarget blood pressure, <130/80 mm Hg or <125/75 mm Hg if more than 1 g/d/1.73 m of proteinuria2.Control diabetes3.Control lipid levelsTarget LDL-C, <100 mg/dLbSI conversion factor: To convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259.4.Use antiproteinuric antihypertensive agentsAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsAngiotensin receptor blockersAldosterone inhibitorsDiltiazem5.Avoid NSAIDs6.Recommend dietary modificationSuggest low-fat, low-salt American Heart Association dietRestrict calories, if patient has diabetes7.Avoid radiocontrast radiographic tests and premedicate patient if required8.Advise patients with renal failure to discuss their condition with any physician who intends to prescribe a new medication so that the physician can avoid certain medications or adjust doses, as appropriate9.Encourage regular visits to a nephrologist (every 6-12 mo) |\n| --- |\n\n【143】a LDL-C = low-density hpoprotein cholesterol; NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.\n\n【144】b SI conversion factor: To convert LDL-C values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259.\n\n【145】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【146】Identifying the cause of an elevated serum creatinine level can be challenging. The systematic approach should greatly assist clinicians in identifying those causes. Although referral to a nephrologist will sometimes still be necessary, this approach should make the patient and primary care physician better able to understand what issues the nephrologist may need to address to evaluate the elevated serum creatinine level. If the renal failure becomes chronic, the primary care physician can help the patient maintain long-term renal function by encouraging adherence to the 9-pronged treatment approach.\n\n【147】CME Materials\n-------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The term is derived from the Greek words “thalassa” (Θάλασσα) meaning “sea” and the suffix -aima (αίμα) or “blood,” denoting the high prevalence of this hematologic disorder in people of Greek, Italian, Cypriot, Turkish, or Sicilian ancestry—all of whom originate around the Mediterranean and Black Seas.\n\n【1】Whipple, who was classically trained at Andover Academy in New England, recalled the story from Xenophon's _Anabasis_ in which a weary Greek mercenary army returning from battles in Persia crested a mountain and at last gazed upon the Black Sea; the relieved army shouted in unison, “Thalassa, thalassa!”\n\n【2】In 1889, Rudolf Von Jaksch (1855-1947) in Vienna described “anaemia leucaemic infantum,” a form of chronic anemia in young children associated with hepatosplenomegaly, leukocytosis, and pronounced changes in size and shape of the red cells, with varying degrees of anemia. This disorder became known as “von Jaksch anemia” and was later found to include a heterogeneous group of conditions, including anemia of chronic inflammation, anemia of malaria and parasitic infections, anemia associated with malnutrition, and congenital anemias.\n\n【3】Despite the prevalence of von Jaksch's anemia in Southern Europe, it was an American physician, Thomas Benton Cooley (1871-1945), who first differentiated the unique syndrome that became known as “Cooley's anemia” from the broader mix of disorders included in von Jaksch anemia. Cooley recognized that even among well-nourished Italian and Greek children in Detroit who lived far from areas of malaria prevalence; there was still a disorder that included hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, muddy-yellowish skin discoloration, and a distinctive appearance caused by the enlargement of the cranial and facial bones. He presented a landmark series of “erythroblastic anemia” patients before the American Pediatric Society in 1925 and published this series in 1927. In subsequent correspondence, Cooley referred to this disorder as Mediterranean anemia; later, other authors began to call it Cooley's anemia, an eponym he disliked.\n\n【4】Cooley was born on June 23, 1871, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His father, Thomas McIntyre Cooley, had been a chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court and dean of the University of Michigan Law School. He gave his name to a law school in Michigan and high school in Detroit. Young Thomas Cooley attended Ann Arbor High School and the University of Michigan, from which he received a doctor of medicine degree in 1895.\n\n【5】He trained as an intern at the Boston City Hospital and later returned to Ann Arbor as an instructor in medicine at the University of Michigan from 1898 to 1900. After a brief trip to Germany, he again worked as a resident physician at the Boston City Hospital for a year and undertook specialized training in hygiene and contagious diseases. He then returned to Ann Arbor as an assistant professor of hygiene at the University of Michigan from 1903 to 1905. Along with Victor Vaughn (1851-1929), the director of the Michigan hygienic laboratory, Cooley was able to procure a $2500 grant to provide free anti-rabies treatment for Michigan residents. In his annual report to the Michigan Academy of Science in April 1904, Cooley presented meticulous details about the success of this endeavor, which included vaccination of 38 patients.\n\n【6】In 1905, Cooley left the University of Michigan and began working as a pediatrician in Detroit. There, he was instrumental in developing a multidisciplinary approach to contagious diseases and other pediatric conditions, involving health officers, nurses, social workers, and the public. Collectively, this group was called the “Association for the Study and Prevention of Infant Mortality.” He also started a “Babies' Milk Fund” in Detroit to decrease infant mortality due to malnutrition. He was a strong proponent of preventive health, and in a June 1912 address to the American Medical Association at their 63rd annual session at Atlantic City, New Jersey, he stated “the greatest chance to reduce infant mortality has been shown to lie in educating the public, the mothers, and young girls in infant feeding and hygiene. This work is the right and duty of the pediatrist \\[sic\\] to direct and it cannot meet with its full measure of success unless under skilled direction.”\n\n【7】With his pediatric experience and leadership skills, he was appointed as the Assistant Chief of the Children's Bureau of the American Red Cross in France during World War I. While in France, he led several projects, including implementation of a school of public health for children, establishment of a pediatric hospital, development of a boarding school for orphans, and foundation of a training school for visiting housekeepers who were tasked with visiting impoverished children and ensuring proper hygiene and diet. On his return, the _Detroit Free Press_ ran a full-page feature about Cooley's work in France entitled, ‘Children Of France Are Forever His Debtor.’ The government of France awarded him the Legion of Honor in 1924.\n\n【8】From 1921 to 1941, Cooley was the head of pediatric service at Children's Hospital of Michigan. He was also a professor of pediatrics at Wayne State University in Detroit from 1936 to 1941. He was known for being austere and aristocratic, and enjoyed solitary pursuits, including fishing, boating, and golf. Michigan pathologist Wolf Zuelzer (1909-1987) noted in 1957, “Though an extremely able clinician and astute observer, \\[Cooley\\] was more interested in the theoretical ramifications of the case at hand than in the individual patient. Rounds on Cooley's service at Children's Hospital were occasions for brilliant and stimulating dissertations on a few cases selected for the challenge they offered to an analytical mind, or else for a review of urgent decisions which simply could not be put off any longer. The systematic coverage of the service, the detailed instructions of his resident staff failed to interest him.” Cooley received the honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Michigan in 1940, and retired in 1941.\n\n【9】Without any formal training in hematology or genetics, Cooley started researching various pediatric hematological disorders in the 1920s. In addition to describing thalassemia, he described congenital sideroblastic anemia in the 1940s, and challenged the notion that sickle cell anemia was a race-restricted disease. He was of the opinion most physicians pay too little attention to medical genetics and emphasized that family histories might be put to better use by medical geneticists than by genealogists.\n\n【10】He was a charter member of the Central States Pediatric Society and of the American Academy of Pediatrics and later served as president of both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Pediatric Society.\n\n【11】Cooley died of hypertensive heart disease on October 13, 1945, in Bangor, Maine. His obituary in _American Journal of Diseases of the Child_ referred to his work on thalassemia as ‘one of the outstanding contributions to hematology by an American.’ His seminal 1927 paper on thalassemia also was included in a 2001 collection of 86 ground-breaking 20th century hematology papers.\n\n【12】The importance of thalassemia prevention programs was commemorated philatelically by Cyprus on October 23, 1978 (Michel catalog #492, Scott #504.)

She was sitting in church when she developed left-sided posterior neck and shoulder pain, followed 1 hour later by sudden-onset dense left-sided weakness. Emergency medical services were called, and they activated the prehospital stroke-notification protocol. The patient arrived at the emergency department approximately 30 minutes after the onset of the weakness. She had no previous history of these symptoms. She had no history of loss of consciousness or epileptiform activity. She denied any history of trauma. She also denied any recent history of fatigue, fever, chills, diaphoresis, or rigors. Her home medications included atenolol 50 mg twice daily, glimepiride 2 mg twice daily, lisinopril 20 mg daily, hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily, and acetaminophen as needed for joint pain in knees and hands.\n\n【1】On examination, she was visibly uncomfortable, owing to left-sided neck and shoulder pain. Her blood pressure was 172/73 mm Hg, pulse 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation was 97% while breathing room air. On examination, she had flaccid weakness of the left arm and leg. Sensation was preserved. The remainder of the neurological examination, including cranial nerves, was normal. No Horner syndrome was seen.\n\n【2】Her calculated National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stroke Scale was 8 (score of 4 for \"no movement\" of left arm and 4 for \"no movement\" of left leg). Blood tests revealed the following (reference ranges provided parenthetically): serum glucose 176 mg/dL (70 to 140 mg/dL); hemoglobin 12.2 g/dL (12.0 to 15.5 g/dL); platelet count 255 X10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (150 to 450 X10 <sup>9 </sup> /L); prothrombin time 10.8 sec (8.8 to 11.9 sec); international normalized ratio (INR) 1.1 (0.9 to 1.2); and activated partial thromboplastin time 27.2 sec (23.7 to 36.1 sec). A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not reveal any acute intracranial abnormalities.\n\n【3】*   1.\n\n【4】    **Which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ next course of action?**\n\n【5】    *   a)\n\n【6】        Intravenous thrombolysis\n\n【7】    *   b)\n\n【8】        Thromboembolectomy\n\n【9】    *   c)\n\n【10】        Further imaging\n\n【11】    *   d)\n\n【12】        Lumbar puncture\n\n【13】    *   e)\n\n【14】        Admission for cardiac monitoring\n\n【15】The presentation could be concerning for an ischemic stroke. The incidence of acute ischemic stroke in this age group is significant and thus should be high on the differential diagnosis. A noncontrast head CT scan is often performed in the setting of acute stroke and is helpful to rule out hemorrhage. Ischemic stroke, however, may not be detectable early on, and a normal head CT scan does not rule out this possibility. What is atypical for ischemic stroke in this case is the associated neck and shoulder pain. The pattern of weakness can also help localize the lesion and thus guide further investigations; arm and leg weakness without associated face weakness would be less consistent with a cortical lesion.\n\n【16】Intravenous thrombolysis is considered in select patients with ischemic stroke within 4.5 hours of onset of symptoms. However, with her neck and shoulder pain occurring around the same temporal period as her hemiparesis, one would want to consider other etiologies that can present with pain and hemiparesis—such as aortic artery dissection, cerebral artery dissections, or spinal hematomas—before administering therapies such as intravenous thrombolysis. A thromboembolectomy would be considered in select patients with acute stroke and thrombus seen in the proximal cerebral arteries on CT angiogram. However, as a CT angiogram had not been performed yet, it would be premature to consider thromboembolectomy as the next course of action. Further imaging would be the most suitable choice in this situation given the atypical presentation of the left-sided hemiparesis.\n\n【17】A lumbar puncture would be indicated had there been clinical suspicion of subarachnoid hemorrhage (eg, presenting with a thunderclap headache) for this patient with a normal noncontrast CT scan of the head. Admission for cardiac monitoring would not be advised in this scenario, as time is of the essence to establish a diagnosis so that appropriate management can be instituted.\n\n【18】A telestroke consultation was initiated, and the consulted physician thought that the history did not fit a classic ischemic stroke, especially given the neck and shoulder pain. The decision was made to proceed with further imaging. A CT angiogram of the chest, neck, and head vessels was performed, which did not show any dissection of the aortic, vertebral, or carotid arteries.\n\n【19】*   2.\n\n【20】    **Which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ next imaging investigation?**\n\n【21】    *   a)\n\n【22】        Noncontrast MRI scan of the cervical spine\n\n【23】    *   b)\n\n【24】        Noncontrast MRI scan of the head\n\n【25】    *   c)\n\n【26】        Plain x-ray of the neck\n\n【27】    *   d)\n\n【28】        Conventional cerebral angiography\n\n【29】    *   e)\n\n【30】        Ultrasound of the soft tissues of the head and neck\n\n【31】An MRI cervical spine scan without contrast material would be the most appropriate next step. The neurological presentation of unilateral weakness without facial involvement, together with the neck pain, localizes the lesion to somewhere in the neck region. A CT angiogram was already done to exclude a carotid or vertebral artery dissection. Thus, an MRI scan of the cervical spine should be done next to assess the cervical spinal cord. A noncontrast MRI scan of the head would be more sensitive in diagnosing an acute ischemic stroke than a noncontrast CT scan of the head, but without also including the neck, pathologies in the neck might be missed. A plain x-ray of the neck would be able to look at obvious bony abnormalities of the cervical spine but would not be able to assess the soft tissues. A conventional cerebral angiography (done as a digital subtraction angiography) is a catheter-based angiography that remains the gold standard for evaluating cerebral vessels for arterial stenosis, dissection, or vascular malformations. Our clinical suspicion is pointing us toward a lesion in the neck region, thus making a conventional cerebral angiography unnecessary. An ultrasound of the soft tissues of the head and neck would be useful to assess soft tissue neck masses and help with lymph-node assessment. In newborns and infants, ultrasonography is a well-established method of investigating the spinal canal and cord because the incompletely ossified and predominantly cartilaginous spinal arches in this age group create a good acoustic window.\n\n【32】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【33】US of the spinal cord in newborns: spectrum of normal findings, variants, congenital anomalies and acquired diseases.\n\n【34】However, in adults, mature ossified bone prevents useful examination of the spinal cord. Thus, although an ultrasound of the soft tissues can help us investigate the cause of the neck pain, it will not help us visualize pathologies in the cervical spinal cord, which is our focus for the likely cause of the acute neurological deficit.\n\n【35】The stroke physician recommended a noncontrast MRI scan of the cervical spine. This showed an abnormal heterogeneous posterior left epidural fluid collection extending from C2 to C5 with associated mass effect upon the cervical cord.\n\n【36】*   3.\n\n【37】    **Based on the _clinical picture and imaging findings_ , what would be the _most likely_ diagnosis?**\n\n【38】    *   a)\n\n【39】        Epidural abscess\n\n【40】    *   b)\n\n【41】        Epidural cyst\n\n【42】    *   c)\n\n【43】        Epidural hematoma\n\n【44】    *   d)\n\n【45】        Epidural tumor\n\n【46】    *   e)\n\n【47】        Dural arteriovenous fistula\n\n【48】The left epidural fluid collection would appear to be the culprit causing the patient’s symptoms. Ascertaining the cause of the fluid collection would determine the next plan of management.\n\n【49】An epidural abscess is unlikely, given that abscesses tend to happen more slowly, leading to progressive neurological symptoms, and the patient did not have any other signs of infection such as fever, chills, or rigors. An epidural cyst is also unlikely, given that it tends to grow more slowly, and the symptoms tend to be more insidious in onset. An epidural hematoma would best fit the description of the MRI findings and the timing of the presentation (acute onset of pain and neurological deficit). An epidural tumor would be a solid structure (with or without fluid components) rather than a pure fluid collection and symptoms would occur in a more insidious manner. Patients with spinal dural arteriovenous fistula typically present with slowly progressive myelopathy caused by spinal-cord congestion rather than bleeding. The symptoms are usually slowly progressive over days to weeks, but rapid symptoms can occur if bleeding ensues. However, in this case, this would not be the best answer, as the collection is located in the epidural layer.\n\n【50】The patient continued to have left-sided hemiparesis.\n\n【51】*   4.\n\n【52】    **What would be the _next best_ plan of management?**\n\n【53】    *   a)\n\n【54】        Surgical referral for decompression\n\n【55】    *   b)\n\n【56】        Observation and reimaging in 24 hours\n\n【57】    *   c)\n\n【58】        Intravenous thrombolysis\n\n【59】    *   d)\n\n【60】        Clopidogrel 300 mg orally\n\n【61】    *   e)\n\n【62】        Anticoagulation with enoxaparin\n\n【63】Surgical referral for evaluation and decompression would be the most appropriate next step. The diagnosis of spinal epidural hematoma requires prompt referral to a spine surgery team for evaluation. Patients with significant and/or progressing neurological deficits require urgent surgical intervention, usually a laminectomy, and evacuation of the blood. Observation and reimaging would not be an option, as the patient had a significant neurological deficit. Timely decompression of the hematoma is essential to avoid permanent loss of neurologic function. If the patient already had significant neurological improvement before assessment, observation and reimaging would be a reasonable option. Administration of thrombolytics, antiplatelet agents (aspirin), or anticoagulation (enoxaparin) is contraindicated and could cause the hematoma to enlarge, further compressing the spinal cord.\n\n【64】The patient was transferred to a tertiary medical center for assessment by the spine surgery team. During her transfer, she began to recover her neurological function. By the time she arrived at the tertiary center and was assessed by the surgical team, she only had mild weakness of the left upper and lower extremity, NIH Stroke Scale of 2 (score of 2 for \"some effort against gravity\" of the left arm).\n\n【65】*   5.\n\n【66】    **What is the _most likely_ etiology of this patient’s hematoma?**\n\n【67】    *   a)\n\n【68】        Bleeding secondary to antiplatelet medications\n\n【69】    *   b)\n\n【70】        Bleeding secondary to anticoagulant medications\n\n【71】    *   c)\n\n【72】        Bleeding secondary to trauma\n\n【73】    *   d)\n\n【74】        Bleeding secondary to cervical-spine instrumentation\n\n【75】    *   e)\n\n【76】        Spontaneous bleeding\n\n【77】There was no identifiable risk factor and no precipitant for the patient’s epidural hematoma. After careful history taking, once the patient was in the tertiary center, we did not identify any medications that could have predisposed her to a hematoma: specifically, antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications. We also clarified the patient’s history and determined that there was no preceding trauma, even trivial trauma (such as a sudden neck jerk while driving caused by braking). She also denied any recent cervical spine instrumentation or manipulation (such as a manipulation from a chiropractor). Thus, this was classified as a spontaneous cervical epidural hematoma.\n\n【78】Serial clinical examinations done over 48 hours showed that her neurological function had normalized (NIH Stroke Scale score of 0). Because of resolution of the patient’s neurological impairment, surgery was not performed, and she was discharged home with appropriate follow-up.\n\n【79】Discussion\n----------\n\n【80】Unilateral weakness is a worrisome presentation. Although the etiologies of unilateral weakness are diverse, one of the most common causes is stroke. With an incidence rate of 670 to 970 per 100,000 patients per year\n\n【81】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【82】Heart disease and stroke statistics–2011 update: a report from the American Heart Association.\n\n【83】in this patient’s age group, this would be the first diagnosis that comes to mind. However, other etiologies that can mimic acute stroke should also be considered, such as seizure with postictal paresis (Todd paralysis), migraine aura, hypertensive encephalopathy, spinal-cord disorders, and functional deficit. Studies have reported a misdiagnosis rate of stroke of approximately 10%.\n\n【84】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【85】Avoiding misdiagnosis in patients with neurological emergencies.\n\n【86】Common reasons for misdiagnosis include preconceived notions about patients (for example, assuming that young people do not get strokes), being misled by the patient’s use of words (for example, the patient says “I am having another migraine attack”) or misinterpretation of diagnostic testing (for example, a false normal noncontrast CT scan of the head in early stroke or using a CT scan to diagnose a cerebellar or brain-stem infarction).\n\n【87】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【88】Avoiding misdiagnosis in patients with neurological emergencies.\n\n【89】Careful clinical history and physical examination can help elucidate the etiology or may call to light features that would not be consistent with a particular diagnosis.\n\n【90】When assessing a patient with a neurological deficit, a good approach would be to localize the lesion based on the pattern of the presentation, then to think of an etiology that could affect that area, and finally guide your imaging modality based on the likely etiology. In this case, the patient had negative results of a noncontrast CT scan of the head, which would be expected in an acute ischemic stroke. However, the patient had concurrent neck and shoulder pain, which does not fit the classic presentation of an acute ischemic stroke. Also, the pattern of weakness does not fit with a typical cortical stroke, as there was sparing of the face. The hemiparesis with sparing of the face points toward a subcortical internal capsule lesion, a medullary pyramid lesion, or a spinal-cord lesion. With the associated neck pain, the focus was to investigate etiologies localized to the neck region.\n\n【91】The incidence of acute aortic dissection ranges from 2.6 to 3.5 patients per 100,000 patients per year,\n\n【92】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【93】Thoracic aortic aneurysms: a population-based study.\n\n【94】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【95】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【96】Epidemiology and clinicopathology of aortic dissection.\n\n【97】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【98】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【99】Acute aortic dissection: population-based incidence compared with degenerative aortic aneurysm rupture.\n\n【100】with the incidence of spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection 1.72 per 100,000 patients per year.\n\n【101】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【102】Incidence and outcome of cervical artery dissection: a population-based study.\n\n【103】These conditions can present with chest and neck pain, respectively, with neurological deficits. This, along with the patient’s history of hypertension (being on multiple antihypertensive medications), would warrant investigation to effectively exclude the diagnosis. The CT angiogram of the chest, neck, and head vessels ruled out this diagnosis in our patient.\n\n【104】Spontaneous spinal epidural hematomas are rare, with 1 study estimating the incidence to be 0.1 patients per 100,000 patients per year.\n\n【105】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【106】Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma: findings at MR imaging and clinical correlation.\n\n【107】It is most frequent after the fourth or fifth decade, although it has been reported to occur in all age groups.\n\n【108】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【109】Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma.\n\n【110】The pathophysiology is uncertain, but theories include rupture of the epidural venous plexus and rupture of the spinal epidural arteries as the source of hemorrhage. Sudden-onset neck and shoulder pain followed shortly thereafter by a neurological deficit would be the most common presentation of a cervical epidural hematoma. The characteristic and rapidity of the developing neurological deficit would depend on the level of the lesion and area of the spinal cord affected as well as the severity and rapidity of the bleed. Precipitating factors include antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation therapy, vascular malformations, trauma, and iatrogenic spinal instrumentation. However, there are reported cased on spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma in the literature.\n\n【111】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【112】Spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma.\n\n【113】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【114】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【115】Spontaneous cervical epidural hematoma: report of a case managed conservatively.\n\n【116】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【117】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【118】Spontaneous epidural hematoma of cervical spine.\n\n【119】Treatment usually involves surgical intervention with evacuation of the hematoma to alleviate the compression of the spinal cord by the hematoma.

Young Bruce Beutler’s first intensive exposure to biology was in his father’s laboratory on weekends and school holidays, where he learned how to purify proteins and to assay red cell enzymes such as glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. In high school, he also worked with Susumu Ohno, an immunologist and geneticist at City of Hope who collaborated with his father.\n\n【1】Beutler distinguished himself early academically, graduating from the University of California at San Diego at age 18 and from the University of Chicago’s medical school at age 23. (Ernest Beutler had graduated from the same medical school at age 21, and he suggested to his son that medical training would be a good skill “to fall back on” in case his planned scientific career foundered.) Bruce Beutler’s later scientific focus on innate immunity was in part a result of medical school clinical experience with patients with inflammatory diseases and serious infections.\n\n【2】Beutler’s medical internship was at the University of Texas Southwestern (UT Southwestern) Medical Center at Dallas, followed by a year as a neurology resident at the same institution. In 1983, he moved to Rockefeller University in New York and to the laboratory of Anthony Cerami, where Beutler was the first to isolate murine tumor necrosis factor (TNF). He discovered that the TNF pathway mediated some of the potent inflammatory effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial macromolecule important in the clinical signs of sepsis. In 1986, he joined the faculty of UT Southwestern and also became an assistant investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\n\n【3】During his first few years in Dallas, Beutler helped develop a neutralizing antibody against TNF, etanercept, which is still used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Later, using positional cloning genetic techniques, he was able to demonstrate that one of the mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLR), TLR4, is a critical component of the mammalian LPS receptor complex. ( _Drosophila_ fruit fly Toll receptors were first reported in 1985 by 1995 Nobel laureates Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard and Eric Wieschaus; the German word “toll” means “amazing”.) At least 11 TLRs are now known to exist in humans, and they are fundamental mediators of inflammation and the innate immune response.\n\n【4】In 2000, Beutler moved to The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, where his work focused on randomly induced mutations in mice that altered the animals’ susceptibility to infection. This induced-mutagenesis approach led to discovery of numerous other factors critical to innate immunity, as well as incidental discovery of genes important for other biological processes, such as iron processing and embryogenesis. Beutler returned to UT Southwestern in 2011, where he is currently a Regental Professor and Director of the University’s Center for Genetics of Host Defense.\n\n【5】Beutler received one-quarter of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, as did French immunologist Jules A. Hoffmann (in whose lab the function of _Drosophila_ Toll receptors in immunity was first detected), for “discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity.” Canadian biologist Ralph Steinman received the other half of the 2011 Nobel Prize (inadvertently posthumously) for his discovery of dendritic cells.

Higher BED was associated with increased likelihood of obliteration in univariate Cox regression analyses, when treated as either a dichotomous (≥133 Gy; hazard ratio \\[HR\\],1.52; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.19 to 1.95; _P_ <.001) or continuous variable (HR, 1.00, 95% CI, 1.0002 to 1.005; _P_ \\=.04). In multivariable analyses including dichotomized BED and location, BED remained associated with obliteration ( _P_ \\=.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Biological effective dose ≥133 Gy was predictive of AVM obliteration after single-session SRS within the prescribed margin dose range 15 to 25 Gy. Further study is warranted to determine whether BED optimization should be considered as well as treatment dose for AVM SRS planning.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AVM ( arteriovenous malformation ), BED ( biological effective dose ), CI ( confidence interval ), IQR ( interquartile range ), PIV ( prescription isodose volume ), RR ( relative risk ), TDR ( treatment dose rate )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The Sprint intervention included clinician and staff EHR training, building specialty-specific EHR tools, and redesigning teamwork. We used Agile project management principles to prioritize and track optimization requests. We surveyed clinicians about EHR burden, satisfaction with EHR, teamwork, and burnout 60 days before and 2 weeks after Sprint. We describe the curriculum, pre-Sprint planning, survey instruments, daily schedule, and strategies for clinician engagement.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We report the results of Sprint in 6 clinics. With the use of the Net Promoter Score, clinician satisfaction with the EHR increased from −15 to +12 (−100 \\[worst\\] to +100 \\[best\\]). The Net Promoter Score for Sprint was +52. Perceptions of “We provide excellent care with the EHR,” “Our clinic’s use of the EHR has improved,” and “Time spent charting” all improved. We report clinician satisfaction with specific Sprint activities. The percentage of clinicians endorsing burnout was 39% (47/119) before and 34% (37/107) after the intervention. Response rates to the survey questions were 47% (97/205) to 61% (89/145).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The EHR optimization Sprint is highly recommended by clinicians and improves teamwork and satisfaction with the EHR.

At our institution, similar tactics have generally failed to increase either clinician efficiency or satisfaction with the EHR. Previously, given limited resources, we had prioritized EHR improvements that affected the largest number of clinicians. As a result, interventions that clinicians highly desired, such as specialty-specific improvements in the EHR and individualized EHR training, were not approved or funded, leading to further clinician dissatisfaction. Consequently, we recently designed, implemented, and assessed a novel intervention, the optimization “Sprint,” an intensive team-based intervention designed to reduce clinician EHR burden, alleviate clinician burnout, and improve clinician satisfaction with the EHR, one clinic at a time.\n\n【45】Methods\n-------\n\n【46】Please see the Supplemental Material  for an expanded Methods section that includes meeting and huddle agendas, workflow redesign tactics, clinic-specific and system-wide decision-making strategies, a detailed grid of daily Sprint team activities, and pre- and post-Sprint questionnaires.\n\n【47】### Setting\n\n【48】UCHealth is a large integrated health network in Colorado, consisting of 400 clinics and 9 hospitals, all using a single EHR (version 2015, Epic Systems). Sprints were carried out in 6 clinics . The Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board deemed the activities of this project to be quality improvement and exempt from full review by the institutional review board.\n\n【49】Table 1 Specialties of Clinicians and Clinical Staff\n\n【50】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【51】AMC = Academic Medical Center; APP = advanced practice provider; DO = osteopath; MA = medical assistant; MD = physician; MG = medical group (community); NP = nurse practitioner; PA = physician assistant; RN = registered nurse.\n\n| Clinic | No. of clinicians (MD, DO, NP, PA, and midwife) | No. of clinical staff (RN, MA, and clerk) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| AMC endocrine | 23 | 13 |\n| MG neurology clinic 1 | 5 | 4 |\n| AMC neurology | 96 | 28 |\n| MG hematology | 8 | 7 |\n| MG neurology clinic 2 | 11 | 7 |\n| AMC obstetrics and gynecology | 90 (−13)b13 clinicians who received surveys did not participate in Sprint as their oncology subspecialty was later excluded. | 38 |\n| Total physicians | 167 |  |\n| Total APP (NP, PA, and midwife) | 66 |  |\n| _Total_ | _233 (220)_c233 clinicians received pre- and post-surveys, and 220 clinicians actually participated in Sprint. | _97_ |\n\n【53】a AMC = Academic Medical Center; APP = advanced practice provider; DO = osteopath; MA = medical assistant; MD = physician; MG = medical group (community); NP = nurse practitioner; PA = physician assistant; RN = registered nurse.\n\n【54】b 13 clinicians who received surveys did not participate in Sprint as their oncology subspecialty was later excluded.\n\n【55】c 233 clinicians received pre- and post-surveys, and 220 clinicians actually participated in Sprint.\n\n【56】### Intervention\n\n【57】The Sprints intervention had 3 primary components: (1) training clinicians to use existing EHR features more efficiently, (2) redesigning the multidisciplinary workflow within the clinic, and (3) building new specialty-specific EHR tools. Sprint was a quality improvement intervention, and we prioritized continuous process improvement over consistent data collection. Thus, we adjusted some survey questions over time to provide better insight, and thus the total number of respondents to some questions will differ from others. For each of the 6 clinics, the most updated survey at the beginning of that Sprint was sent to _all_ clinicians in that clinic both before and after Sprint.\n\n【58】#### Sprint Timeline\n\n【59】Sprints were carried out between January 16, 2016, and July 21, 2017. The Sprint leaders met with clinic leaders 90, 60, and 30 days before each Sprint to prepare for the intervention, identify EHR frustrations, and prioritize potential solutions. For pre-Sprint meetings and Sprint on-site details, see the Supplemental Material . During the course of each Sprint, all clinicians had their time protected so that they could participate in a 2-hour kickoff meeting, three 1-to-1 training sessions, and a 2-hour wrap-up session.\n\n【60】#### Agile\n\n【61】We used Agile methodology\n\n【62】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【63】Scrum.org  \nThe Home of Scrum: An Advanced Scrum Master Class.\n\n【64】as a guiding strategy for Sprint. Agile methodology improves software delivery by focusing on the voice of the customer and making rapid incremental improvements in a short time period. We held daily huddles and prioritized tasks on the basis of feedback from clinicians and clinic staff. We used scrum boards to depict progress in fulfilling requested EHR changes. When possible, we facilitated conversations between specialists in the clinic undergoing Sprint and specialists at similar clinics in our organization to build consensus on specialty-specific EHR tools.\n\n【65】#### Training Content\n\n【66】The training content evolved over several iterations of Sprints. The physician informaticist leader built 10 sets of efficiency tips .\n\n【67】Table 2 Clinician Assessment of Helpfulness of Sprint Activities\n\n【68】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【69】EHR = electronic health record; PI = physician informaticist.\n\n| Activity | Description/content | Percentage of respondents who responded positively (No. of respondents)bThe percentage of clinicians who responded “agree” or “strongly agree” to the statement that the listed activity was helpful. A total of 186 clinicians were surveyed, and 84 responded to the survey. Not all clinicians participated in each activity.

A total of 186 clinicians were surveyed, and 84 responded to the survey. Not all clinicians participated in each activity. Total respondents to each question are shown within parentheses.\n\n【73】#### Multidisciplinary Workflow Redesign\n\n【74】Some Sprint team members met individually and in small groups with nonclinician staff to observe the multidisciplinary workflow and patient flow in the clinic. Using this information, trainers taught EHR best practices to staff, and the clinic manager redesigned common workflows so that all clinicians and staff did things the same way. For examples of redesigned workflows, see the Discussion section.\n\n【75】#### Building New EHR Tools\n\n【76】Once EHR tool requests were approved by clinic leaders, the Sprint project manager placed them in a visual chart under the following headings: Backlog, To Do, In Process, Done, and Parking Lot. These items were reprioritized and repositioned daily. In this way, clinicians and clinic staff could see the status of all requests, including Parking Lot items that would not be addressed during Sprint.\n\n【77】#### Fixing Existing EHR Tools\n\n【78】Broken items that were fixed by EHR analysts included flow sheets that no longer calculated correctly, smart links to test results that did not display requested data, and incorrect routing of patient portal messages. The Sprint team also facilitated the repair or replacement of EHR equipment such as keyboard trays, printers, monitors, and radiofrequency identification badge readers for EHR login.\n\n【79】### Personnel\n\n【80】#### The Sprint Team\n\n【81】The Sprint team consisted of 1 full-time equivalent primary physician informaticist (a role shared by 2 physicians), a nurse informaticist, a project manager, 4 EHR trainers (nonclinician staff certified to teach EHR tools), and 4 EHR analysts. The physician informaticist helped translate clinician requests for EHR improvements into specific technical changes. Having the physician informaticist translate requests reduced misunderstandings and eliminated many hours of wasted EHR analyst effort. For example, a clinician’s request for a complex cardiac monitoring order took up dozens of hours of EHR analyst time. Despite this, the requestor was still unsatisfied. After a physician informaticist became involved, a new design strategy was implemented, which satisfied both the requestor and the analyst. By involving the physician informaticist earlier in the request and design process, we estimated that dozens of hours were saved in the process of handling subsequent requests. The nurse informaticist helped redesign multidisciplinary workflows and trained clinic staff. The Sprint project manager coordinated pre-Sprint meetings, was present in the clinic for the entire Sprint, and coordinated the activities of the 4 clinics simultaneously involved in various stages of the Sprint process.\n\n【82】#### The Clinical Operations Team\n\n【83】Before Sprint, organizational operational leaders (the vice president of ambulatory services and the ambulatory clinic directors) worked with the Sprint leaders to select clinics for Sprint according to each clinic’s desire for EHR improvement and the presence of effective clinic leadership. In larger academic specialty clinics, each subspecialty designated one “clinical content lead” clinician to build consensus within their group, prioritize requests, communicate with the Sprint team, and review newly built EHR tools.\n\n【84】### Assessment of Clinician Participation, Satisfaction, and Burnout\n\n【85】#### Participation\n\n【86】The Sprint team tracked individual clinician attendance at all Sprint activities. A large grid that displayed activities and clinician names made it easy to identify clinicians who were not participating and give them additional attention.\n\n【87】#### Satisfaction With Sprint and the EHR\n\n【88】We sent all clinicians a pre-Sprint survey created with SurveyMonkey.com 60 days before their clinic’s Sprint and a post-Sprint survey 2 weeks after the Sprint process concluded. Survey responses were confidential and anonymous For survey instruments, see the Supplemental Material . Clinic leaders reminded clinicians to complete the surveys 3 times over a 2-week period. Clinician satisfaction with the Sprints intervention and their satisfaction with the EHR before and after Sprint were assessed by calculating the Net Promoter Score (NPS).\n\n【89】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【90】The one number you need to grow.\n\n【91】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【92】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【93】Qualtrics  \nWhat is Net Promoter Score (NPS)?\n\n【94】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【95】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【96】Insights From Analytics.

We also reviewed “physician efficiency profile (PEP)” EHR metrics that measured actual activity in the EHR. Lastly, all 186 clinicians in the academic neurology and obstetrics and gynecology clinics were asked to rate on a Likert-like scale the value of specific Sprint training activities.\n\n【102】#### Burnout\n\n【103】In both the pre- and post-Sprint surveys, we presented clinicians with the “emotional exhaustion domain” item from the Maslach Burnout Inventory.\n\n【104】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【105】Single item measures of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization are useful for assessing burnout in medical professionals.\n\n【106】We considered the emotional exhaustion of burnout to be present if the response was at least once a week in frequency.

Although in the clinics, Sprint team members also captured clinician comments about the Sprint process and its effect on their work and home lives.\n\n【111】Results\n-------\n\n【112】### Participation in Sprint\n\n【113】A total of 220 clinicians participated in Sprint, of whom 143 (65%) attended at least 3 training sessions and 42 (19%) participated in more than 10 sessions. Seventy-seven clinicians (35%) attended fewer than 3 training sessions and 44 (20%) participated in no sessions. Pre- and post-Sprint surveys were sent to a total of 233 clinicians . Thirteen clinicians from an oncology subspecialty of obstetrics and gynecology were subsequently excluded from Sprint because of physical distance. The percentage of physicians (32%) and advanced practice providers (APPs) (30%) attending fewer than 3 sessions were similar. The percentage of APPs responding to the survey reflected their prevalence in the clinician population: 29% of all clinicians were APPs and 27% of survey respondents were APPs.\n\n【114】### Satisfaction With Sprint\n\n【115】We were able to survey clinicians in 5 of 6 clinics after Sprint. Because of an oversight, we did not include the NPS for Sprint question for 1 large clinic. Eighty-nine of 145 clinicians (61%) responded to the post-Sprint survey. For all respondents, the NPS for Sprint was +52 .\n\n【116】Figure 1 Clinician NPSs for Sprint and the EHR. NPS range: −100 (worst) to +100 (best). Response rates: NPS for Sprint: 61% (89 of 145); NPS for the EHR: before Sprint: 54% (125 of 233), 2 weeks after Sprint: 52% (122 of 233). EHR = electronic health record; NPS = Net Promoter Score.\n\n【117】### Evaluation of Sprint Training Activities\n\n【118】We surveyed all 186 clinicians from 2 academic clinics about the helpfulness of Sprint training activities, and 84 (45%) responded. The highest-rated activities were 1-to-1 training sessions, speech recognition training, new tools training, note-writing smart phrases, and observation/shadow sessions .\n\n【119】### Satisfaction With the EHR\n\n【120】Before Sprint, the NPS for the EHR was −15, indicating low levels of satisfaction, with 54% of clinicians (125 of 233) responding. Two weeks after Sprint, the NPS for the EHR increased to +12, with 52% clinicians (122 of 233) responding .\n\n【121】### Evaluation of EHR Clinical Processes\n\n【122】Two hundred five clinicians were asked about the EHR clinical process. Clinicians from the first 2 Sprint clinics did not receive these questions because they were redesigned with feedback after their Sprints. The pre- and post-Sprint response rates to the survey questions about EHR-related clinical processes were 52% (107 of 205) and 47% (97 of 205), respectively. In response to the statement “Our clinic has clear policies on how staff and clinicians can best use the EHR together,” the percentage of affirmative responses (defined as either “agree” or “strongly agree”) increased from 21% at baseline to 53% after Sprint (an increase of 32 percentage points). In response to the statement “The EHR helps us provide excellent care,” the percentage of affirmative responses increased from 57% to 77% (an increase of 20 percentage points). In response to the statement “Our clinic’s use of the EHR has improved in the last few months,” the percentage of affirmative responses increased from 23% to 79% (an increase of 56 percentage points). In response to the statement “The amount of time I spend documenting patient care,” 43% of clinicians indicated a decrease . The percentage of clinicians responding affirmatively to these statements before and after Sprint was similar between academic and community practices (data not shown).\n\n【123】Figure 2 Clinician perceptions of EHR processes in the clinic. Response rates: pre-Sprint: 52% (107 of 205); post-Sprint: 47% (97 of 205). EHR = electronic health record.\n\n【124】We reviewed the EHR metric data (PEP). The versions of PEP at that time did _not_ track “minutes in system after 7pm” and did not accurately capture data on APPs, and the measurement tool definitions changed during the time line of our interventions. The pre- and post-Sprint PEP data were thus not comparable.\n\n【125】### Effect of Sprint on Burnout\n\n【126】We changed our burnout question after our first 2 clinics and report results from the latter 4 clinics. Before Sprint, 119 of 205 clinicians (58%) responded to the burnout question; after Sprint, 107 of 205 (52%) responded. Before Sprint, 39% of clinicians reported feeling burned out; after Sprint, the percentage was 34%. On the basis of chi-square analysis, the _P_ value was .434, and this difference does not reach the predetermined α level of significance.\n\n【127】### Most Frequently Requested New EHR Tools\n\n【128】Over the 20 months of Sprint, we most frequently built synopsis reports, flow sheets, patient-entered questionnaires, customized note templates, and laboratory and radiology result smart links . Tools were built, tested, and deployed while the Sprint team was working in the clinic. Requests for new tools were typically fulfilled within 1 to 2 days, which pleasantly surprised many clinicians. One clinician noted, “This is unexpected. It feels like someone in IT actually cares.”\n\n【129】Table 3 Most Frequently Built New EHR Tools\n\n【130】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【131】EHR = electronic health record.\n\n| EHR tool | Description and example |\n| --- | --- |\n| Graphic reportsbEHR-specific term is “synopsis.” | A disease- or specialty-specific table and graphic that combines disparate data and displays it over time. Data can include vitals; medication doses; laboratory, radiology, or pathology results; progress notes; and flow sheets.

One participating clinician wrote, “You have made me a better mother. I get home in time for dinner with my family.” A clinic medical director stated, “A related outcome … has been the improvement in clinicians’ morale and attitudes.” Another clinician noted, “Your extraordinary team spirit is a model for us and for any team.” “This is like a dream,” observed one medical director, “probably will save me 30 minutes a day in charting and placing orders alone.” A clinic manager noted, “The efficiency of clinicians … has improved considerably” and “Most clinicians were at the functional level that they were initially trained at years ago … I cannot say enough good things about this Sprint.” From the 6 clinics, there were 40 survey comments about Sprint and about a dozen verbal comments recorded by Sprint team members. Of all these, all but 2 were positive statements. The negative statements were as follows: “The fact that it took this much time and investment to do a Sprint to retrain providers, nurses, and support staff to use a system we had already been using for >5 years speaks to the fact that it is TOO COMPLICATED!” and “You can’t help me… this is a terrible system, and I don’t have time to talk to you.”\n\n【137】Discussion\n----------\n\n【138】Sprint was a short-term, intensive, multidisciplinary intervention designed to improve the experience of clinicians and clinic staff using the EHR, one clinic at a time. On the basis of the results of clinician surveys, we concluded that Sprint was a successful intervention. Clinicians gave the Sprints intervention an NPS of +52, which is similar to ratings by customers of Apple’s iPad (+65) and Amazon.com (+69) in 2013.\n\n【139】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【140】Insights From Analytics. Top 10 U.S. Net Promoter Scores (NPS) for 2013.\n\n【141】The NPS for the EHR improved from −15 at baseline to +12 after Sprint. The emotional exhaustion measure of burnout decreased from 39% to 34% after Sprint, a statistically nonsignificant difference. However, because more than 50% of the entire population responded, a 5% reduction may indeed be a nonrandom improvement. Nevertheless, we theorize that it may take longer than a 2-week practice efficiency intervention to substantially improve clinician burnout.\n\n【142】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【143】A team-based model that improves job satisfaction.\n\n【144】After participating in Sprint, 44% of clinicians indicated that the number of hours spent charting in the EHR had reduced. After Sprint, more clinicians reported that the clinic team was working well together, providing excellent care, and that their use of the EHR had improved. This intervention exhibits that a clinic-based, user-focused intervention to reduce EHR burden and improve clinician satisfaction with the EHR is both feasible and effective.\n\n【145】The Sprint method may be associated with other positive outcomes, including specialty-specific EHR customization and improved clinical workflow, which can be difficult to achieve with more conventional approaches to EHR optimization (e-mail blasts, mass training sessions, etc). In our experience, redesigning clinical workflow in tandem with efforts to reduce the clinician EHR burden was critically important to improving clinician satisfaction with the EHR. Workflow changes sometimes necessitated retraining of clinicians and clinic staff on EHR tools. However, workflow changes almost always required effective interpersonal communication, task delegation, and the creation of clinic standard policies. With the Sprint method, once a new workflow was agreed upon, the clinic could implement the change immediately. Coordinated and rapid changes in clinical workflow and improved EHR efficiency were a source of substantial clinician satisfaction. For example, some clinics implemented a standard prescription renewal process for 90 days and 3 additional refills, reducing unnecessary variation. One clinic developed a standard previsit online patient questionnaire about neurological disorders to be used for every visit.\n\n【146】Several other elements of the Sprints intervention were critical to its success. Chief among these was having a physician informaticist leader on the Sprint team to efficiently translate clinician requests for EHR changes into technical and/or training solutions, a nurse informaticist to focus on staff and team workflows, a dedicated project manager, and consistent Sprint team members whose collective knowledge and effectiveness increased with each Sprint. Having the entire Sprint team on-site in the clinic was also invaluable, because the team could huddle and make decisions quickly. Equally important was the face-to-face involvement of clinic leaders and clinician superusers in the process. Sprint was not a spectator sport; it was an all-hands-on-deck effort, and the more the clinic leaders and clinicians participated, the more each clinic benefited. The short time frame and rapid tempo of Sprint showed clinicians that improvements were being made each day, which helped to build confidence in the process. Some clinician superusers continued to be EHR experts for their colleagues long after the Sprint process concluded, an ideal situation for long-term improvement. Clinicians often believe that the main problem with practice efficiency is a poorly designed EHR with insufficient specialty tools. However, by the end of Sprint, we estimated that 80% of the improvement in clinician experience resulted from training clinicians on existing tools and redesigning teamwork, with only about 20% coming from newly customized EHR tools.\n\n【147】Executing Sprint was not without challenges. There is always organizational pressure to increase clinical productivity and see more patients, which can be at odds with efforts to reduce clinician burnout. We were able to convince leaders to protect clinician time for participation in Sprint, because busy clinicians without protected time are unlikely to participate. It is important that leaders do not expect an increase in patient volume as a direct result of Sprint. In addition, despite these measures, about one-third of clinicians did not participate adequately in Sprint. It is possible that these clinicians opted out because they judged themselves to already be using the EHR optimally. However, on the basis of our in-clinic observations, we believe that nonparticipators may be so burned out and disengaged that offering ways to improve practice efficiency is insufficient. Complementary approaches, such as building a “culture of wellness” or improving “personal resilience,” may also be needed.\n\n【148】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【149】NEJM Catalyst. Physician well-being: the reciprocity of practice efficiency, culture of wellness, and personal resilience.\n\n【150】### Cost and Benefit\n\n【151】The team of 11 costs $1.2 million annually, including one internal medicine physician salary at about $280,000 including benefits. With a full schedule, a Sprint team can accomplish seventeen 2-week Sprints annually. The team can engage 30 clinicians per Sprint, or about 500 clinicians per year, which results in approximately $2400 spent per clinician. Also, for every clinician in Sprint, we request 7 hours protected time. Using 52 weeks per year and 40 hours a week, a full-time clinician spends 2080 hours per year. Per clinician at $280,000, 7 hours loss of productivity is $942, or about $1000. Aggregating, Sprint may cost an organization $3400 per clinician. Using these assumptions, cost per 500 clinicians in a 1-year Sprint may be $1.7 million.\n\n【152】Using assumptions from the AMA _STEPS forward_ physician burnout calculator,\n\n【153】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【154】The business case for investing in physician well-being.\n\n【155】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【156】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【157】AMA STEPSforward  \nOrganizational changes lead to physician satisfaction.\n\n【158】if 12.5 physicians out of 500 burn out per year, an intervention may reduce burnout by 20% or by 2.5 physicians, and cost of replacing a physician is $1 million, it works out to be $2.5 million cost avoidance. Measured another way, $3400 per clinician per year could be offset by each clinician seeing 1 more patient every 2 weeks.\n\n【159】### Limitations\n\n【160】This intervention does have several limitations. Lacking a standardized instrument to assess the EHR user experience, we chose to use NPS methodology and a short survey to assess clinician satisfaction with Sprint and with the EHR. However, neither the NPS instrument nor the survey questions have been validated for use in this setting. A second limitation is that the Sprints intervention constantly evolved over time as the Sprint team strove to best meet the needs of each individual clinic. Thus, not all clinicians received exactly the same Sprints intervention or the same version of the survey. Furthermore, we did not identify and survey a comparable control group. Lastly, Sprint was carried out at a single US health care organization. In the 6 participating clinics, academic clinicians outnumbered community clinicians, and the findings may not be generalizable to other health care settings.\n\n【161】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【162】The Sprint approach to EHR optimization represents a viable option for improving teamwork, reducing clinician EHR burden, and improving clinician satisfaction with the EHR. In this brief intervention, emotional exhaustion from burnout did not change. The Sprint optimization effort was so well received by clinicians that funding for a second full Sprint team has been allocated to increase the pace of this work. Additional organizational experience, methodological refinements, and the use of validated assessment methods are needed to determine whether the Sprints intervention can be applied to solve other challenges associated with EHR-enabled patient care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The primary care clinician is critically involved in the pharmacologic management of AF, whether it be direct prescription of AADs or managing potential drug-drug interactions with other medications.

This includes drug initiation, monitoring, and discontinuation. As more patients develop AF and are treated with antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) along with a concomitant escalation of comorbidities with aging, disease complexity and polypharmacy inevitably increase. The management of AADs in AF can seem daunting, given their potentially lethal adverse effect profile, which includes the potential for proarrhythmia and multiple drug-drug interactions.\n\n【19】As recent data have shown improved patient outcomes with the maintenance of sinus rhythm, it is to be expected that more patients will be prescribed these agents.\n\n【20】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【21】Effect of catheter ablation vs antiarrhythmic drug therapy on mortality, stroke, bleeding, and cardiac arrest among patients with atrial fibrillation: the CABANA randomized clinical trial.\n\n【22】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【23】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【24】Catheter Ablation for atrial fibrillation with heart failure.\n\n【25】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【26】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【27】Early rhythm-control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【28】Trials conducted since the early 2000s had not demonstrated a superiority of rhythm control over rate control in managing patients with AF.\n\n【29】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【30】A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【31】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【32】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【33】Randomized trial of rate-control versus rhythm-control in persistent atrial fibrillation: the Strategies of Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (STAF) study.\n\n【34】In specific subsets of patients, such as AF and heart failure, AF ablation has been shown to improve left ventricular systolic function.\n\n【35】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【36】Catheter Ablation for atrial fibrillation with heart failure.\n\n【37】Studies have also depicted a lower risk of stroke in patients treated with rhythm control compared with rate control.\n\n【38】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【39】Rhythm versus rate control therapy and subsequent stroke or transient ischemic attack in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【40】More recent literature from a large randomized controlled trial revealed that early rhythm control within 1 year of AF diagnosis reduced the composite primary outcome of cardiovascular death, stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, or acute coronary syndrome at a 5-year follow-up.\n\n【41】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【42】Early rhythm-control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【43】It is anticipated that more patients with AF will have AADs as part of their treatment regimen in an attempt to maintain sinus rhythm.

To guide our readers, a simple general conceptual schema for the use of AADs in AF is provided in Figure 1 . These are presented in a fashion to enhance familiarity with and safety of AADs and to afford comfort and confidence with management and surveillance of these agents.\n\n【44】Figure 1 Simplified schema for an antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) approach for atrial fibrillation (AF) patients.

He weighs 65 kg; blood pressure is 145/92 mm Hg, and electrocardiography (ECG) shows second-degree type I atrioventricular (AV) block. Laboratory studies reveal a creatinine concentration of 1.5 mg/dL (to convert mg/dL to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4). He has been treated with atenolol for AF rate control and hypertension for the past 25 years.\n\n【50】### Atenolol Use in Elderly Patients\n\n【51】Atenolol was a popular beta blocker widely used in the 1980s and 1990s for both hypertension and migraine prevention. Atenolol has continued to be prescribed to many patients despite numerous trials showing that it is an inferior antihypertensive agent and that there is an increased risk of death in the elderly compared with other blood pressure drugs.\n\n【52】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【53】Atenolol in hypertension: is it a wise choice?\n\n【54】Like other sinus and AV nodal–blocking agents, it is associated with a risk of sinus node dysfunction and advanced degrees of heart block. It is renally excreted, and elderly patients with declining renal function are at greater risk from the adverse effects of atenolol.\n\n【55】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【56】Atenolol. A reappraisal of its pharmacological properties and therapeutic use in cardiovascular disorders.\n\n【57】#### Resolution\n\n【58】Because of his fatigue and second-degree type I AV block, you discontinue atenolol to see whether symptoms improve after drug washout. If he requires rate-controlling agents in the future, you plan to use metoprolol and to up-titrate as needed with a lenient rate control strategy for a target heart rate in AF of less than 110 beats/min.\n\n【59】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【60】Lenient versus strict rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【61】You recommend an antihypertensive without beta-blocker properties, such as amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide.

He has a history of AF and heart failure and is receiving digoxin in addition to guideline-directed medical therapy. He has a creatinine concentration of 2.1 mg/dL and a digoxin level of 2.0 ng/L (upper limit of normal for the treatment of AF; to convert ng/L to nmol/L, multiply by 1.281). ECG shows junctional rhythm at 85 beats/min.\n\n【64】### Digoxin Use in AF and Heart Failure\n\n【65】In heart failure, digoxin improves myocardial contractility. It increases vagal tone and slowing of the AV node, resulting in decreased ventricular rates. Whereas it has not been shown to improve mortality (with some studies suggesting increased mortality), it has been shown to improve symptoms and to reduce hospitalizations in patients with heart failure.\n\n【66】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【67】Digoxin and mortality in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【68】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【69】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【70】Digoxin-associated mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.\n\n【71】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【72】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【73】Digitalis Investigation Group  \nThe effect of digoxin on mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure.\n\n【74】Despite being commonly used in the past, it is no longer considered first-line therapy for either indication, especially in those with reduced kidney function and in the elderly.\n\n【75】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【76】2019 AHA/ACC/HRS focused update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society.\n\n【77】However, in a 2020 trial (Rate Control Therapy Evaluation in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation \\[RATE-AF\\]) in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, digoxin was shown to improve symptoms and to reduce N-terminal pro–B type natriuretic peptide levels compared with a beta blocker (bisoprolol), indicating a potential shift in favor of digoxin in this particular population of patients.\n\n【78】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【79】Rate Control Therapy Evaluation in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation—RATE-AF.\n\n【80】It is possible that the drug may again be more widely used, and thus the primary care clinician needs to be aware of the risks of digoxin, especially in elderly patients.\n\n【81】### Monitoring of the Patient Receiving Digoxin\n\n【82】Digoxin has a relatively narrow therapeutic window. For heart failure alone, the target serum levels should be between 0.5 and 1.0 ng/L. For AF, the target range is higher (0.5-2.0 ng/L).\n\n【83】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【84】Lower serum digoxin concentrations in heart failure and reassessment of laboratory report forms.\n\n【85】It is primarily excreted by the kidneys and should be used carefully in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Digoxin effect, which is due to therapeutic digoxin therapy and not necessarily related to toxicity, can be seen as characteristic “sagging” ST segments . Of note, discontinuation of digoxin in stable patients may be associated with an increased risk of heart failure hospitalizations.\n\n【86】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【87】Effects of discontinuation of digoxin versus continuation at low serum digoxin concentrations in chronic heart failure.\n\n【88】Figure 2 Electrocardiogram showing significant digoxin effect.

Digoxin immune antibody is given with resolution of arrhythmia and symptoms.\n\n【91】Amiodarone: the Most Effective AAD With the Potential for Most Adverse Effects\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【92】A 75-year-old man presents to clinic for routine follow-up after repeated hospitalizations for AF with rapid ventricular rates. The patient is nervous because he has read about many issues with long-term amiodarone use. He wants to know about the potential adverse effects, monitoring, and drugs to avoid.\n\n【93】### Potential Adverse Effects of Amiodarone\n\n【94】Amiodarone is a highly lipid soluble molecule with a long half-life (25-100 days). Long-term amiodarone use can be associated with numerous adverse effects, and thus active surveillance is required. The most important toxic effects are hepatic (elevated liver enzyme activities in 15%-30% and cirrhosis in <3%), cardiac (QT prolongation or AV block), thyroid (hypothyroidism in 6% or hyperthyroidism in 0.9%-2.0%), pulmonary (interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in 1%-17%), ocular (corneal deposits in >90% or optic neuritis in <2%), and skin (photosensitivity in 25%-75% or blue-gray discoloration in 4%-9%). Some of these can occur early within months (ie, toxic effects in the lung, liver, and thyroid), whereas others may take years to be manifested and occur in a cumulative dose-dependent fashion.\n\n【95】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【96】Prescribing amiodarone: an evidence-based review of clinical indications.\n\n【97】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【98】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【99】Adverse reactions of amiodarone.\n\n【100】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【101】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【102】Population-level incidence and monitoring of adverse drug reactions with long-term amiodarone therapy.\n\n【103】### Monitoring of the Patient Receiving Long-term Amiodarone Therapy\n\n【104】If amiodarone use is longer than 3 months, the following baseline tests should be obtained: ECG for QT prolongation (avoid if QTc >500 milliseconds) and AV block (avoid if second-degree type II or greater); thyroid function test; liver function test; pulmonary function test; chest radiograph; formal ophthalmologic examination; and initial skin examination. Thyroid and liver function testing should be performed every 6 months. ECG, chest radiography, eye examination, and pulmonary function testing may be repeated every 6 to 12 months. All other testing should be repeated as symptoms dictate.\n\n【105】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【106】2019 AHA/ACC/HRS focused update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society.\n\n【107】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【108】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【109】Prescribing amiodarone: an evidence-based review of clinical indications.\n\n【110】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【111】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【112】Practical guidelines for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone.

These medications include warfarin, digoxin, calcium channel blockers (CCBs; diltiazem, verapamil), and certain statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin). The doses of warfarin and digoxin should be decreased by 50% when amiodarone is started if patients are receiving these agents.\n\n【117】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【118】P450-based drug-drug interactions of amiodarone and its metabolites: diversity of inhibitory mechanisms.\n\n【119】A more comprehensive list of potential drug interactions in regard to hepatic metabolism through the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system is shown in Table 1 . Medications that reduce heart rate, such as beta blockers and CCBs, may require closer monitoring.

Theoretically, this reduces the risk of thyroid toxic effects. There are many situations in which its use is contraindicated, however. It should not be used in renal failure. It should be avoided in patients with persistent AF without plans for restoration of sinus rhythm and in patients with decompensated heart failure. In short, dronedarone still requires monitoring; it can be used in certain clinical situations, although efficacy remains questionable.\n\n【125】#### Resolution\n\n【126】You discuss this with the patient. He understands the risks and rationale for the use of amiodarone and agrees to surveillance testing.

He asks what to monitor when it is being initiated, how to use it, and whether he needs to be receiving anticoagulation.\n\n【129】### Mechanism of Action of Flecainide and Propafenone\n\n【130】Flecainide and propafenone are sodium channel blockers, both of which are commonly used for AF. They are oral medications that can be taken in a scheduled twice-daily dose for long-term AF prevention and suppression or in a so-called as-needed pill-in-pocket dosing approach for episodes.\n\n【131】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【132】Some patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation should carry flecainide or propafenone to self treat.\n\n【133】Both medications should be avoided in patients with preexisting ischemic or structural heart disease (which includes left ventricular hypertrophy as well as significant valve disease).\n\n【134】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【135】Cardiac arrhythmia suppression trial.\n\n【136】The decision on when and how to use these agents is shown in Figure 4 .\n\n【137】Figure 4 Flow diagram for consideration of flecainide or propafenone for atrial fibrillation (AF). The strategy for selection of the pill-in-pocket or daily dosing approach should be made in consideration of frequency of symptoms, presence of reliable symptoms, and patient’s preference. BB, beta blocker; BID, twice daily; CCB, calcium channel blocker; ECG, electrocardiography; TID, three times daily; TTE, transthoracic echocardiography.\n\n【138】### Pill-in-Pocket Strategy: Monitoring and Initiation\n\n【139】Baseline ECG is necessary to determine baseline QRS duration and any evidence of conduction system disease. Baseline echocardiography should also be performed to evaluate for structural heart disease. Initiation should occur in a monitored setting, in either the emergency department or hospital, both to ensure efficacy and to monitor QRS duration for the first dose. Once safety and efficacy have been established, the pill-in-pocket strategy is used on an as-needed basis to terminate AF, with instructions on the maximum dose per 24 hours.\n\n【140】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【141】Clinical effectiveness of a systematic \"pill-in-the-pocket\" approach for the management of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.\n\n【142】This requires patients to have reliable symptomatic palpitations when AF occurs to know when to take the drug.\n\n【143】### Scheduled Daily Dosing and Stress Testing\n\n【144】For patients with twice-daily scheduled dosing, treadmill ECG to specifically monitor for QRS duration widening, atrial flutter, or ventricular arrhythmias should be performed 1 to 2 weeks after this agent is started. These medications exhibit “use dependence,” which means that there is a greater drug effect at faster heart rates. Stress testing before starting of these agents should be done to rule out ischemia if there is suspicion for underlying coronary artery disease as propafenone and flecainide are contraindicated in these patients. QRS widening with ventricular arrhythmias on treadmill ECG should prompt discontinuation.\n\n【145】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【146】Antiarrhythmic therapy in atrial fibrillation: indications, guidelines, and safety.\n\n【147】### Anticoagulation\n\n【148】The decision as to whether to start anticoagulation should be based on time in AF and CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score, which is used to estimate risk of ischemic stroke. In general, patients with reliable symptoms of AF for less than 24 hours with a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score of less than 2 are considered low risk and may not need long-term anticoagulation.\n\n【149】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【150】Predictors of outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation: what can be used now and what hope is in the future.\n\n【151】Transesophageal echocardiography is often used to rule out thrombus before initiation of an AAD, especially if the time in AF is unknown and if the patient had not previously received anticoagulation with an elevated CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score. If direct current cardioversion is performed, anticoagulation should be continued for a minimum of 4 to 6 weeks after cardioversion regardless of risk score and continued indefinitely in those with a risk score of 2 or more.\n\n【152】### Important Medication Considerations and Drug Interactions\n\n【153】When flecainide or propafenone is started with either approach, it is important also to start a low dose of either a beta blocker or a CCB to prevent the development of atrial flutter with rapid 1:1 conduction, a rhythm that can produce heart rates above 200 beats/min.\n\n【154】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【155】1:1 atrial flutter induced by flecainide, whilst the patient was at rest.\n\n【156】Both medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and thus have many important drug interactions . It is important for clinicians to be aware of these important interactions. Key points for use of sodium channel blockers for AF are summarized in Table 2 .\n\n【157】Table 2 Key Summary Points for Sodium Channel Blockers (Vaughan-Williams Class Ic)\n\n| Flecainide or propafenone |\n| --- |\n| • Always administer the medication in combination with a low-dose beta blocker or CCB to avoid atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction. |\n| • The medication is able to be taken as needed by a “pill-in-pocket” dosing strategy for paroxysmal AF with reliable symptoms. |\n| • The drug is most efficacious at higher heart rates; perform treadmill ECG within 1-2 weeks of initiation to evaluate for widening of QRS or ventricular arrhythmia, particularly for daily dosing. |\n| • Avoid in structural heart disease (eg, > mild valve disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), prior heart attack, or active ischemia. |\n\n【159】AF, atrial fibrillation; CCB, calcium channel blocker; ECG, electrocardiography.\n\n【160】#### Resolution\n\n【161】You advise him to consider both strategies. If he were to choose to start pill-in-pocket flecainide or propafenone, he would need to take the first dose in a monitored setting, with a beta blocker or CCB taken 30 minutes before the first dose. If he chooses the scheduled dosing approach, he will need treadmill ECG 1 to 2 weeks after initiation. You defer long-term anticoagulation at this time, given that his CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score is 0.\n\n【162】Dofetilide (Potassium Channel Blocker; Class III AAD): Strategy for Structural Heart Disease or Heart Failure\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【163】A 75-year-old woman with hypertension presents for AF management. She is already taking dofetilide, which was initiated in the hospital setting. She has normal renal function, and her QTc with this agent is 474 milliseconds. Of note, she required a stay of 2 extra days in the hospital before starting this drug because she was taking hydrochlorothiazide. The additional days were needed to allow the hydrochlorothiazide to be stopped and washed out of her system before starting of dofetilide. She asks about the dangers of taking this medication and what can increase this risk.\n\n【164】### Mechanism of Dofetilide and the Concerns With QTc Prolongation\n\n【165】Dofetilide is a potassium channel blocker commonly used in AF. It exhibits reverse-use dependence, which means that the drug is more potent at slower heart rates.\n\n【166】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【167】Cardiovascular drugs. Dofetilide.\n\n【168】Dofetilide requires inpatient initiation because of the potential for significant QT prolongation. ECG should be performed every 6 months to monitor the QTc interval. Dose reduction or termination may be indicated, depending on renal function, heart failure status, and the QTc interval. The prescribing cardiologist should assist with any dose adjustment.\n\n【169】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【170】Cardiovascular drugs. Dofetilide.\n\n【171】### Drug Interactions With Dofetilide\n\n【172】Two antihypertensives that should not be used in these patients are hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil. Hydrochlorothiazide interferes with renal tubular cation exchange, which can increase dofetilide concentrations and result in hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.\n\n【173】<sup><a>30</a></sup>\n\n【174】Considerations for dofetilide use in the elderly.\n\n【175】These electrolyte derangements are particularly dangerous in patients with prolonged QTc. Prolonged QTc interval can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias, such as torsades de pointes (TdP). Verapamil is contraindicated because it inhibits CYP3A4 and can result in reduced dofetilide excretion.\n\n【176】Because of reverse-use dependence, beta blockers and CCBs should be used carefully, reduced in dose, or completely avoided if dofetilide is prescribed. This prevents the development of bradycardia, which will prolong the QTc interval and potentiate the risk of TdP in these patients. Caution should be exercised with all drugs that prolong the QTc interval or are inhibitors of CYP3A4. These include drugs that are listed in Table 1 and Table 3 . It is critical to avoid hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia as well, and oral supplementation may be needed to minimize QTc interval prolongation.\n\n【177】Table 3 AADs and Other Common Agents That Cause QT Prolongation\n\n|  | QT prolongation |\n| --- | --- |\n| Outpatient AADs | AmiodaroneDofetilideSotalol |\n| Drugs with potential interactions | Antiemetics (ondansetron, metoclopramide)Antipsychotics (haloperidol, droperidol)Antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, macrolides, trimethoprim, azoles)LoperamideMethadone |\n\n【179】AADs, antiarrhythmic drugs.\n\n【180】#### Resolution\n\n【181】You decide to avoid verapamil and hydrochlorothiazide. You avoid beta blockers, given the concern for bradycardia, and use a first-line agent such as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. You monitor magnesium and potassium levels and plan to prescribe oral supplementation if these are lower than 2 mmol/L or 4 mmol/L, respectively.\n\n【182】Sotalol (Potassium Channel Blocker): a Potassium Channel Blocker With Beta-Blocker Effect\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【183】A 55-year-old woman with AF comes in for consideration of initiating an AAD. She has normal renal function and a normal ejection fraction noted on echocardiography. Her resting heart rate is 52 beats/min. Her husband is receiving sotalol for AF, and she wants to know whether this would be a suitable medication for her.\n\n【184】### Sotalol vs Dofetilide\n\n【185】Sotalol has many similarities to dofetilide. Sotalol is a potassium channel blocker commonly used for AF. It prolongs the QTc interval and requires inpatient initiation. It is also cleared through the kidneys. Unlike dofetilide, sotalol has an additional beta-blocker effect. Therefore, you should be particularly vigilant about bradycardia, which may potentiate deadly ventricular arrhythmias such as TdP. This drug, like dofetilide, exhibits reverse-use dependence and thus works more effectively at slower heart rates.\n\n【186】<sup><a>31</a></sup>\n\n【187】Rate dependence of the effect of antiarrhythmic drugs delaying cardiac repolarization: an overview.\n\n【188】Sotalol should not be used in patients who are bradycardic while awake (heart rate <60 beats/min), given the higher risk for TdP. Key points for use of potassium channel blockers are summarized in Table 4 .\n\n【189】Table 4 Key Summary Points for Potassium Channel Blockers (Vaughan-Williams Class III)\n\n| Sotalol and dofetilide |\n| --- |\n| • The drug is most efficacious at slower heart rates; need to avoid significant bradycardia. |\n| • Beta blockers and CCBs should be used carefully or discontinued. |\n| • Inpatient loading is required for 5 doses (both are twice-daily medications). |\n| • Careful use is necessary with drugs that can provoke hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (eg, diuretics). |\n| • The drug is contraindicated if baseline QTc is >450 milliseconds. Avoid other QT-prolonging medications; concern for TdP. |\n| • Avoid the drug in patients with renal dysfunction as it is renally cleared. |\n| • Monitor with creatinine, potassium, and magnesium levels and ECG every 6-12 months. |\n\n【191】AF, atrial fibrillation; CCB, calcium channel blocker; ECG, electrocardiography; TdP, torsades de pointes.\n\n【192】#### Resolution\n\n【193】Given her sinus bradycardia, you decide she is not a good candidate for sotalol. She may be a candidate for dofetilide, which does not have the added beta-blocker effect but is still of concern, given her already low resting heart rate. She may be a candidate for catheter ablation or require a pacemaker for safe institution of other AADs for AF treatment. You refer her to an electrophysiologist for an in-depth discussion of treatment options.\n\n【194】AADS and QT Prolongation\n------------------------\n\n【195】A 65-year-old man with prior colon adenocarcinoma presents with nausea and diarrhea. He has a history of AF while receiving sotalol for many years. He also takes loperamide as needed. ECG today shows sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block (LBBB), heart rate of 62 beats/min, and a QTc interval of 525 milliseconds. He wants to know what medications to avoid as he read that some can be bad for his heart.\n\n【196】### Measurement of QTc\n\n【197】The QT interval should be measured from the start of the QRS to the end of the T wave (measured in milliseconds; 1 small box on standard ECG is 40 milliseconds, and 1 large box (5 small boxes) is 200 milliseconds). The end of the T wave may be unclear or obscured by a U wave. A common recommendation is to draw a tangent line along the steepest part of the terminal portion of the T wave until it intersects with the isoelectric line as shown in Figure 5 . Note, this means that the terminal portion of the QT interval measurement may not be on the electrocardiographic signal itself. This is then corrected for heart rate by the Bazett formula, which involves dividing the QT interval by the square root of the R-R interval (measured between 2 consecutive R waves, in seconds).\n\n【198】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【199】Comparison of different QT interval measurements in the assessment of QTc during dofetilide administration in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【200】Figure 5 QT and JT measurement with correction for wide QRS. The QT and JT measurements are shown for normal QRS (left) and wide QRS (center and right). Note, on the left panel, the measurement of the terminal portion of the QT/JT is the intersection of the tangent line and the isoelectric line and does not intersect with the electrocardiographic signal itself. The Bazett formula for QTc and simple QT correction for wide QRS are shown. LBBB, left bundle branch block; RBBB, right bundle branch block.\n\n【201】For a preexisting wide QRS, there are many proposed formulas to correct for a wide QRS of any form (such as LBBB). The most often used at our institution is QT – (QRS – 120), essentially removing the contribution of the widened QRS to the QT (compared with if it were normal, <120 milliseconds). A simpler method is measurement of the JT interval (end of the QRS to the end of the T wave) without rate correction. A JT interval of less than 400 milliseconds is considered acceptable .\n\n【202】### QT-Prolonging Medications\n\n【203】Many common medications can prolong the QT interval: antiemetics (ondansetron, metoclopramide), antipsychotics (haloperidol, droperidol), antibiotics (fluoroquinolones, macrolides, trimethoprim, azoles), and antidiarrheals (loperamide). A list of common QT-prolonging AADs and other medications is provided in Table 3 . If QTc is greater than 500 milliseconds or JT is greater than 400 milliseconds, the patient is a greater risk for development of TdP.\n\n【204】### Other Clinical Situations to Avoid\n\n【205】In addition to avoidance of other QT-prolonging medications, clinicians should be mindful of risk or propensity for electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia) as well as severe bradycardia. If any of these situations seems likely, consideration of discontinuation of sotalol (as well as of dofetilide) may be required as this can exacerbate QTc prolongation and lead to TdP.\n\n【206】#### Resolution\n\n【207】After correction of LBBB, his QTc is 480 milliseconds (<500 milliseconds), which has been stable. You avoid any QTc-prolonging medications and maintain adequate electrolyte balance. You recommend an antidiarrheal other than loperamide, given its QTc-prolonging effects.\n\n【208】AADS and Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【209】A 75-year-old man with persistent AF status despite two catheter ablations who is currently taking sotalol presents with worsening dyspnea on exertion. Echocardiography shows a reduced ejection fraction of 35% while in AF with an average rate of 110 beats/min (previously, ejection fraction was 60% and average heart rate was 65 beats/min). He notes that in the past, additional diuretics helped with his lung congestion and leg swelling.\n\n【210】### Drug Interaction Considerations in Heart Failure\n\n【211】In addition to renal and hepatic clearance issues from organ dysfunction in heart failure, there are important drug interaction considerations in using AADs for these patients. Diuretics, such as furosemide, torsemide, and bumetanide, may provoke hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. These electrolyte derangements may potentiate dangerous arrhythmias with use of AADs such as dofetilide and sotalol. These medications should be monitored carefully or discontinued. CCBs should generally be avoided in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.\n\n【212】### Restoration of Sinus Rhythm in Heart Failure\n\n【213】AF in patients with heart failure portends a poorer outcome, and randomized controlled trials (Catheter Ablation versus Standard Conventional Therapy in Patients with Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Atrial Fibrillation \\[CASTLE-AF\\]; heart failure subgroup of the Catheter Ablation vs Antiarrhythmic Drug Therapy for Atrial Fibrillation \\[CABANA\\] trial) have shown improved cardiovascular outcomes with sinus rhythm.\n\n【214】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【215】Effect of catheter ablation vs antiarrhythmic drug therapy on mortality, stroke, bleeding, and cardiac arrest among patients with atrial fibrillation: the CABANA randomized clinical trial.\n\n【216】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【217】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【218】Catheter Ablation for atrial fibrillation with heart failure.\n\n【219】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【220】<sup><a>33</a></sup>\n\n【221】Catheter ablation for treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【222】Evidence from the 2020 Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention (EAST-AFNET 4) trial showed that early rhythm control with AAD or ablation had improved cardiovascular outcomes, including cardiovascular death, stroke, and heart failure hospitalizations, compared with usual care (rate control in most cases).\n\n【223】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【224】Early rhythm-control therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【225】In the setting of heart failure, there are few pharmacologic options for rhythm control. Sinus rhythm can be restored with an AAD, such as amiodarone or dofetilide. Nondrug options include AF catheter ablation and AV nodal ablation with pacemaker implantation. As such, it is important to refer these patients to an electrophysiologist to consider early rhythm control, given the data on mortality benefit. The potential reasons to consider catheter ablation in AF are listed in Table 5 .\n\n【226】Table 5 When to Consider Catheter Ablation for Atrial Fibrillation\n\n| • Heart failure with reduced or preserved ejection fraction |\n| --- |\n| • Previous intolerance to or inefficacy of one or more classes of AADs |\n| • Drug interactions with other necessary medications |\n| • Current or likely risk for development of severe hepatic or renal dysfunction |\n| • Baseline heart rate or ECG abnormalities that preclude certain AADs |\n| • Patient’s preference to avoid daily medications |\n\n【228】AADs, antiarrhythmic drugs; ECG, electrocardiography.\n\n【229】#### Resolution\n\n【230】You initiate a diuretic with careful monitoring of potassium and magnesium concentrations. You set up consultation with an electrophysiologist to discuss treatment options for this AF.\n\n【231】AADS in Chronic Kidney and Liver Disease\n----------------------------------------\n\n【232】A 76-year-old man with chronic alcoholism with resultant cirrhosis and chronic kidney disease with a creatinine concentration of 2.2 mg/dL has recurrent episodes of symptomatic AF requiring hospitalization and cardioversion. He wants to know whether there are any AADs that would be suitable for him, given his chronic kidney and liver disease.\n\n【233】### Renally Cleared AADs and Anticoagulants\n\n【234】Many AADs are renally cleared, requiring dose adjustments or avoidance in the setting of chronic renal failure. These include flecainide, propafenone, atenolol, sotalol, dofetilide, and digoxin. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, amiodarone is often used in this setting. Most beta blockers (except atenolol) and CCBs can be used. Warfarin may be used for anticoagulation. Of the direct oral anticoagulants, dabigatran and rivaroxaban should be avoided in severe renal dysfunction.\n\n【235】<sup><a>34</a></sup>\n\n【236】The efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with chronic renal insufficiency: a review of the literature.\n\n【237】Apixaban may be considered with reduced dosing.\n\n【238】<sup><a>35</a></sup>\n\n【239】Outcomes associated with apixaban use in patients with end-stage kidney disease and atrial fibrillation in the United States.\n\n【240】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【241】<sup><a>36</a></sup>\n\n【242】Apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and advanced chronic kidney disease.\n\n【243】AADs with major renal clearance are listed in Table 6 .\n\n【244】Table 6 Major Metabolic Routes of Antiarrhythmic and Anticoagulation Agents\n\n|  | Major renal clearance | Major hepatic clearance |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Class I | Disopyramide | FlecainidePropafenoneDisopyramide |\n| Class II | AtenololBisoprololNadolol | MetoprololCarvedilol |\n| Class III | SotalolDofetilide | Amiodarone |\n| Class IV |  | VerapamilDiltiazem |\n| Other | Digoxin |  |\n| Anticoagulants | Apixaban (can reduce dose)DabigatranRivaroxaban | Warfarin (dose by INR)ApixabanRivaroxaban |\n\n【246】INR, international normalized ratio.\n\n【247】### Hepatically Cleared AADs and Anticoagulants\n\n【248】Hepatically cleared AADs should be used carefully in patients with cirrhosis. Hepatically cleared AADs include flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, and most beta blockers and CCBs. Whereas flecainide and propafenone should generally be avoided completely, the other hepatically cleared AADs can be used at reduced doses with close monitoring.\n\n【249】<sup><a>37</a></sup>\n\n【250】Review article: prescribing medications in patients with cirrhosis—a practical guide.\n\n【251】Warfarin is extensively metabolized by the liver but may be used with careful monitoring of the international normalized ratio.

Referral to discuss the option of catheter ablation is appropriate when the patient prefers to avoid treatment with AADs. This can be due to problems with previous AAD treatment, such as intolerance, inefficacy, drug interactions, and comorbidities such as heart failure. Even though AAD therapy may be directed by cardiologists and electrophysiologists, we hope these key lessons offer primary care clinicians the ability to manage patients more confidently and safely when they are required to receive AAD therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

This advance also created a generation of physicians, nurses, and technicians who were harmed by radiation before the potential risks of X-rays were fully understood.\n\n【1】Common early practices such as a radiologist putting his finger in front of a fluoroscope until his own bones appeared (in order to ensure the fluoroscope was appropriately warmed up before examining a patient) contributed to extremely high doses of radiation exposure for health care workers. Both local tissue injury (eg, radiation burns, necrosis) and systemic complications (eg, aplastic anemia, myelodysplasia or myeloid leukemia) resulted.\n\n【2】Percy Brown, an early Boston radiologist, wrote in his 1936 book _American Martyrs to Science_ , “Within 90 days of Roentgen's discovery, suspicion aroused in the minds of many investigators that X-rays or something involved in the production of X-rays might have some ill-effect on living tissues exposed to them.” However, it was not until 1928 that formal recommendations about exposure were introduced at the 2nd International Congress of Radiology in Stockholm.\n\n【3】The most well-known early Brazilian radiologist was Álvaro Freire de Villalba Alvim. He was born on April 16, 1863, in Vassouras, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Relatively little is known about his early life. In 1887, Alvim graduated from the Bahia School of Medicine and set up a general practice in Rio de Janeiro. In 1896, he traveled to France and studied with Marie and Pierre Curie. He bought X-ray equipment during his trip and later installed this equipment in his clinic upon returning to Brazil.\n\n【4】In 1897, Alvim was asked to assess radiographically a pair of xiphopagus conjoined twins, Rosalina and Maria Pinheiro Davel, prior to a planned separation surgery by Eduardo Chapot Prévost (1864-1907), a pioneering Brazilian surgeon. Alvim's radiographs helped demonstrate that the twins did not share any vital structures, though one twin had dextrocardia. The surgery—the first attempt at separation of conjoined twins in South America—was considered a success. Although Maria died of postoperative complications, Rosalina lived to adulthood. This brought Alvim considerable recognition and he was subsequently referred many patients.\n\n【5】Alvim later contributed to the invention of leaded drapes, which helped decrease radiation exposure to patients, early radiologists, and radiology technicians. Unfortunately, the introduction of lead shielding came too late for Alvim himself; he lost parts of both hands because of radiation burns. With the assistance of hand prostheses, however, he was able to continue his practice and experimentation. On May 21, 1928, Alvim died of leukemia in Rio de Janeiro. He is considered a “martyr to science” in Brazil.\n\n【6】The President of Brazil in the mid-1920s, Arthur Bernardes, awarded Alvim a humanitarian medal shortly before his death. There are also several schools, streets, and clinics in Rio de Janeiro that bear Alvim's name. In December 1963, Brazil honored Alvim philatelically (Scott# 971) on the 100th anniversary of his birth. The stamp depicts Alvim working with a hand prosthesis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Patients older than 55 years with at least 1 radiographically confirmed nontraumatic vertebral compression fracture (VCF) were identified, and those with evidence of secondary osteoporosis, traumatically induced VCF, long-term oral corticosteroid use, or bone malignancy were excluded. The remaining 57 patients were categorized into 3 groups: those receiving treatment with ROPE only (n=20), PVP only (n=20), or both PVP and ROPE (n=17).

This therapeutic strategy in infectious diseases, based on passive immunization, reaches back more than 100 years to its use during the influenza pandemic of 1918 and to the award of the inaugural Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901 to Emil von Behring for demonstrating its efficacy in diphtheria. Passive immunization relies on neutralizing antibodies that bind to proteins on the surface of infectious agents, thereby neutralizing these agents and interrupting processes that drive the infectious disease; other constituents in convalescent plasma may also exert beneficial effects. Neutralizing antibodies are engendered in the course of recovery from an infectious disease, and those that target SARS-CoV-2 are present in convalescent plasma in variable amounts in patients recovering from COVID-19. To study the potential efficacy of convalescent plasma in COVID-19, Joyner and collaborators set the stage in early 2020 for a multicenter investigation of this question, recognizing at the very onset that a fundamental requirement would be the collection of convalescent plasma and its distribution to regional medical centers caring for patients with COVID-19. This goal was successfully achieved by a national Expanded Access Program created by the US Food and Drug Administration in partnership with Mayo Clinic and blood banking centers nationwide. In the present issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Joyner et al provide a safety analysis in 20,000 patients with severe COVID-19 or at risk for developing severe COVID-19 who were administered convalescent plasma; this study is a follow-up to their prior safety analysis of the first 5000 patients so treated, all of whom are included in the present analysis. Convalescent plasma was administered to participants as clinically decided by the managing physician and as part of a modified clinical trial design. Within 4 hours of transfusion, less than 1% of transfusions were attended by serious adverse events, the latter including circulatory overload, acute lung injury, and severe allergic reactions. Of the 63 fatalities that occurred at this timepoint, 12 possibly, 1 probably, 0 definitely were linked to the plasma transfusion. At 7 days after transfusion, cardiac events and thromboembolic/thrombotic events occurred in approximately 3% and less than 1% respectively, but the overwhelming majority of these events were not ascribable to transfusion with convalescent plasma. The seven-day mortality averaged 8.6% and was higher in those subsets of patients either in the intensive care unit, requiring ventilator support, with septic shock, or with multi-organ dysfunction. Interestingly, in their prior report of 5000 patients with COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma, the mortality rate was higher at 12%. Joyner et al offer 3 possible explanations for this decline in mortality in the present analysis: 1) general improvement in US health care systems in managing ill patients with COVID-19; 2) earlier administration of convalescent plasma to patients; and 3) more expeditious recruitment of donors recovering from COVID-19 and obtaining their plasma, thereby increasing the likelihood that their convalescent plasma would be more enriched with neutralizing antibodies. The reassuring and important finding of the present study is the relative safety of administering convalescent plasma to hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Joyner and collaborators are to be congratulated for their percipience in envisioning the need for this study and their herculean accomplishment in rapidly organizing and spearheading this logistically challenging study. Their forthcoming study on the efficacy of convalescent plasma in COVID-19 is anxiously awaited.\n\n【3】Primary Care in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond: Quo Vadis?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】The crisis of COVID-19 redirects so much of the health care system to the necessity of detecting, treating, and limiting the spread of the disease. This abrupt redeployment of health care resources to such exigencies created by an unanticipated pandemic impacts aspects of the health care system in at least two major ways: First, such diversion interrupts attention to and conduct of the primary mission of aspects of health care; and, second, the stress of COVID-19 lays bare and exacerbates their pre-existing inadequacies. In the present issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , two perspectives discuss the latter consideration as it applies to primary care and broadly outline how to address this issue. As pointed out by Lin et al, long before the COVID-19 era, primary care faced numerous challenges including insufficient time afforded to patients because of the number of patients needed to be seen; insufficient or inconsistent attention to chronic care and preventive services; limitations and disparities in capacity and access; uneven quality of care; affordability; the importance accorded to primary care; and the reimbursement for primary care. In envisioning the path ahead, Lin et al note that the constraints of the COVID-19 crisis necessitated and enabled the rapid growth of telemedicine, and this powerful and versatile technology (with a more supportive reimbursement environment) has become an indispensable component in primary care now and into the future. Lin et al emphasize the importance of patient-generated data through an expanding menu of technology-based tools, the advisability of preventive care undertaken between visits, and the importance of population health management. With these essential components, Lin et al propose an integrated and sequential process that incorporates pre-scheduling, pre-visit planning, the medical visit, and inter-visit care management, all shaped and directed by human governance aided by the remarkable power of artificial intelligence. In an accompanying perspective, Sinsky agrees with the transformative potential of telemedicine, but emphasizes that the optimism surrounding telemedicine should be tempered by recognition of its potential risks and limitations. Sinsky draws an analogy to the advent and incorporation of the electronic health record (EHR) in primary care some 20 years ago, an advance similarly met with high expectations. But, for all its indubitable benefits, the mixed blessings of the EHR became readily apparent, including its substantiated role in contributing to physician burnout. Sinsky underscores that telemedicine should be incorporated in primary care within a framework that is cognizant of the importance of teamwork and relationships in patient care, the risks of multitasking, the importance of a faithful accounting of all time that is spent, and the need to decide which patients are more suited for virtual care. Sinsky concludes with a perspective that differs from the one provided by Lin et al on workflows and processes in primary care, and how preventive care should be organized. Both perspectives, however, are united in the view that now is the time to address and heal the ills that afflict primary care, in part by the judicious incorporation of telemedicine and other technological innovations. Primary care is a cornerstone in health care, and insightful discussions such as those provided by Lin et al and Sinsky enable the informed restructuring and strengthening of primary care and the fuller realization of its indispensable mission.\n\n【5】Cellular Entry of SARS-CoV-2 Via ACE2 and TMPRSS2: Therapeutic Implications\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】A critical event in the development of COVID-19 is cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. For this to occur the viral spike proteins must bind to the ACE2 receptor on cellular surfaces. An obligatory prior step is the priming of the spike protein as it is cleaved at specific sites, a function in which another surface receptor, TMPRSS2 (a proteolytic enzyme), is instrumental. Viral entry into cells then ensues after which the virus proliferates and kills cells, thereby incurring local and systemic inflammatory responses; interestingly, after viral cell entry occurs, the ACE2 receptor is downregulated. Two articles in the present issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ discuss the therapeutic implications surrounding the involvement of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2. Poland et al point out that while ACE2 expression enables viral entry, ACE2 exerts cytoprotective effects in tissues. Such beneficial effects occur because ACE2 degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, the latter representing a vasodilating, anti-inflammatory, and anti-fibrotic peptide, and thus one that opposes the recognized vasoconstricting, proinflammatory, and profibrotic actions of angiotensin II; ACE2 expression, through angiotensin 1-7, thus mitigates angiotensin II-dependent inflammation and other adverse effects on tissues. As further pointed out by Poland et al, divergent effects may also surround the use of angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). On the one hand, ARBs increase plasma concentrations of angiotensin II which serves to increase expression of ACE2 and thus, theoretically, increasing cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2; on the other, such increased expression of ACE2 exerts cytoprotective effects in tissue via its anti-inflammatory and other salutary actions. These latter effects of ARBs serve as the basis, in part, for the clinical trials of these agents in COVID-19. Another approach involves blocking the virus in the extracellular space by recombinant ACE2 protein, a soluble form of ACE2 that acts as a decoy and diverts SARS-CoV-2 away from the membrane bound ACE2. The other surface receptor involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry, TMPRSS2, is also a potential therapeutic target in COVID-19 for multiple reasons, as clearly delineated by Baughn et al in the same issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ . First, preclinical studies indicate that as tissues are inflamed and injured, TMPRSS2, unlike ACE2, does not appear to exert a cytoprotective role; thus inhibiting the function of TMPRSS2 may not exert adverse effects. Second, rodent models with genetic deficiency of TMPRSS2 exhibit less severe disease when infected by SARS-CoV; extrapolating from these preclinical findings to COVID-19 raises the possibility that suppressing the expression/action of TMPRSS2 may be beneficial. Third, agents that inhibit TMPRSS2 activity are clinically available (for example, camostat and nafamostat) and, indeed, these agents are currently undergoing clinical trials in COVID-19. Fourth, the _TMPRSS2_ gene can be induced by androgen-dependent pathways, and thus its expression may be suppressed by androgen deprivation therapy or antiandrogens. The _TMPRSS2_ gene is expressed in diverse tissues, and highly so in the prostate. Androgen deprivation therapy and/or antiandrogens are established approaches in the treatment of prostate cancer and thus represent a plausible therapeutic strategy in COVID-19. In sum, therapeutic strategies targeting receptors for SARS-CoV-2 may offer clinical benefit in COVID-19, and the results of relevant ongoing studies are thus of considerable interest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Consequently, the present study was designed to provide a long-term follow-up (4-6 years) on the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the pattern of AMI in New Orleans.\n\n【40】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【41】### Study Population\n\n【42】We retrospectively identified patients with AMI at Tulane University Health Sciences Center (TUHSC) by using _International Classification of Diseases_ , _Ninth Revision_ , codes 410.1-410.9. The institutional review board at the Tulane Office of Human Research Protection approved the study, waving the requirement for informed consent. Pre-Katrina demographic, clinical, and chronobiological data were assessed over 6 years: from August 29, 1999, to August 28, 2005 (the day Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans). The percentage of admission for AMI after Hurricane Katrina was assessed only over 2 years: from August 29, 2003, to August 29, 2005. Unfortunately, overall TUHSC hospital admission data were not available before 2003. Post-Katrina data for all variables were assessed over 6 years: from February 14, 2006 (the day TUHSC became the first downtown medical center to reopen), to February 13, 2012. All study participants had typical myocardial ischemic symptoms and troponin I levels exceeding the upper limits of normal (as defined by the TUHSC Biochemistry Laboratory). Excluded from all analyses were patients younger than 18 years, patient transfers from outside hospitals, non-New Orleans residents, those with symptom onset while hospitalized, and patients with elevated serum troponin levels in the setting of severe noncardiac illness without documentation of ischemic symptoms. Specifically excluded from chronobiological analysis were patients with inadequate documentation of timing of symptom onset. All clinical and demographic information (including psychiatric history) was obtained from admission nurse triage and physician history and physical reports reflecting both patient- and patient’s family-reported information. Employment status included participation in both full- and part-time jobs.\n\n【43】### Study Design\n\n【44】Pre- and post-Katrina cohorts were compared with regard to the percentage of admissions for AMI, demographic characteristics, and timing of symptom onset. Additional subgroup analyses compared years 1 to 3 with years 4 to 6 after Hurricane Katrina. The percentage of admissions for AMI was calculated by dividing the number of AMI admissions by the total number of TUHSC admissions.\n\n【45】### Statistical Analyses\n\n【46】Nonuniformity between cohorts and subgroups was performed using χ <sup>2 </sup> statistical tests. Differences between group means were compared using unpaired Student _t_ tests.\n\n【47】Results\n-------\n\n【48】A total of 1476 patients were analyzed for demographic and clinical historical data. The post-Katrina group was significantly younger ( _P_ \\=.007), less likely to be white ( _P_ \\=.03), and had significantly higher rates of previously diagnosed coronary artery disease ( _P_ \\=.004), hyperlipidemia ( _P_ \\=.05), psychiatric comorbidities ( _P_ \\=.01), smoking ( _P_ <.001), and lack of employment ( _P_ <.001) . Notable demographic differences between years 1 to 3 and years 4 to 6 after Hurricane Katrina included significantly lower rates of men ( _P_ \\=.01), whites ( _P_ \\=.002), and uninsured ( _P_ <.05) and significantly higher rates of coronary artery disease ( _P_ \\=.001), hyperlipidemia ( _P_ \\=.004), diabetes ( _P_ \\=.04), and psychiatric disease ( _P_ <.001) in the latter period .\n\n【49】Table 1 Comparison of Demographic and Clinical Historical Data in Acute Myocardial Infarction Admissions Before and After Hurricane Katrina and Years 1-3 and 4-6 After Hurricane Katrina\n\n【50】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【51】Data are expressed as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n| Variable | 6 ybefore Katrina(n=299) | 6 yafter Katrina(n=1177) | _P_ value | Years 1-3 after Katrina(n=418) | Years 4-6 after Katrina(n=759) | _P_ value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age (y) | 64.0±14 | 61.9±12 | .007 | 62±13 | 62±12 | .99 |\n| Sex: men | 171 (57.2) | 698 (59.3) | .67 | 281 (67.2) | 417 (54.9) | .01 |\n| Race: white | 144 (48.1) | 457 (38.8) | .03 | 194 (46.4) | 263 (34.6) | .002 |\n| Coronary artery disease | 109 (36.4) | 578 (49.1) | .004 | 161 (38.4) | 417 (54.9) | <.001 |\n| Previous coronary artery bypass | 60 (20.0) | 180 (15.3) | .07 | 57 (13.6) | 123 (16.2) | .27 |\n| Hypertension (systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg or therapy) | 213 (71.1) | 811 (68.9) | .68 | 301 (72) | 520 (67.2) | .34 |\n| Hyperlipidemia (low-density lipoprotein >160 mg/dLbTo convert low-density lipoprotein value to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259.or therapy) | 136 (45.4) | 641 (54.5) | .05 | 193 (46.2) | 449 (59.1) | .004 |\n| Diabetes | 94 (31.3) | 411 (34.9) | .30 | 126 (30.2) | 285 (37.5) | .04 |\n| Psychiatric disease | 20 (6.7) | 145 (12.3) | .01 | 27 (6.5) | 118 (15.5) | <.001 |\n| Substance abuse | 31 (10.2) | 173 (14.7) | .06 | 55 (13.2) | 118 (15.5) | .32 |\n| Smokers | 103 (34.4) | 618 (52.5) | <.001 | 238 (56.9) | 381 (50.2) | .16 |\n| Unemployed | 22 (7.2) | 210 (17.8) | <.001 | 65 (15.3) | 146 (19.2) | .13 |\n| Uninsured | 25 (8.3) | 140 (11.9) | .09 | 65 (15.6) | 75 (9.9) | <.05 |\n\n【53】a Data are expressed as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n【54】b To convert low-density lipoprotein value to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259.\n\n【55】The percentage of admissions for AMI (as measured by the number of AMI admissions divided by the total number of TUHSC admissions) increased from 150 of 21,079 (0.7%) to 1177 of 48,258 (2.4%) after Hurricane Katrina ( _P_ <.001) . Subgroup analyses of years 1 to 3 and years 4 to 6 after Hurricane Katrina revealed that the incidence of AMI admission increased from 418 of 21,092 (2.0%) to 759 of 27,166 (2.8%) total admissions between the 2 periods ( _P_ <.001).\n\n【56】Table 2 Incidence of AMI (Expressed as the Percentage of the Total Number of Admissions at TUHSC) Before and After Hurricane Katrina and Years 1-3 and 4-6 After Hurricane Katrina\n\n| AMI incidence | 2 ybefore Katrina | 6 yafter Katrina | _P_ value | Years 1-3 after Katrina | Years 4-6 after Katrina | _P_ value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total hospital admissions | 21,079 | 48,258 |  | 21,092 | 27,166 |  |\n| AMI admissions | 150 | 1,177 |  | 418 | 759 |  |\n| % AMI admissions | 0.7 | 2.4 | <.001 | 2.0 | 2.8 | <.001 |\n\n【58】AMI = acute myocardial infarction; TUHSC = Tulane University Health Sciences Center.\n\n【59】An assessment of chronobiology of AMI onset was possible in 1180 total patients and in 881 of 1177 patients with AMI after Hurricane Katrina (296 patients were excluded owing to inadequate documentation of symptom onset).

We hypothesize that the reasons for our findings, including the persistent increase in AMI, are multifactorial. Most importantly, it should be pointed out that the city of New Orleans underwent drastic changes after Hurricane Katrina. According to the US Census Bureau, the population has shifted from 455,000 at the time the storm struck (2005) down to less than 225,000 the following year (2006) before increasing to approximately 370,000 (2012). It is likely that our data are strongly affected by these population changes. Nevertheless, we believe that the population of patients seen at TUHSC may have been representative of the city at large to a certain extent. The Tulane University Health Sciences Center was the first downtown New Orleans medical center to reopen after the storm (and remained so for 10 months) and has been estimated to have treated 20% of all New Orleans area AMI in the post-Katrina era.\n\n【72】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【73】Effect of Hurricane Katrina on chronobiology at onset of acute myocardial infarction during the subsequent three years.\n\n【74】In addition to population shift, it has been suggested that the increase in the percentage of AMI admissions at TUHSC was affected by a change in referral pattern (owing to either a decrease in non-AMI or an increase in AMI admission referrals). Given the closure of other area hospitals, it is likely that the observed post-Katrina decrease in non-AMI admissions was caused by the decline in area population as opposed to a reduction in referrals. In contrast, the closure of area hospitals might seem to suggest an increase in chest pain or AMI referrals to TUHSC. However, a closer examination of AMI referrals reveals that this may not have actually been the case. Health care within downtown New Orleans was most dramatically altered by the closure of the 2680-bed Charity Hospital. Although the effects of this hospital closure cannot be overestimated, it should be noted that during the 10 years before Hurricane Katrina, Charity Hospital did not have an active cardiac catheterization laboratory. Therefore, in the post-Katrina era, potential patients with AMI in downtown New Orleans were referred to the same 2 facilities as in the pre-Katrina era: TUHSC and University Hospital (which reopened as Interim Louisiana State University Public Hospital 10 months after the reopening of the TUHSC). The fact that the increase in AMI at TUHSC persisted during years 2 to 6 (after Interim Louisiana State University Public Hospital reopened) suggests that our findings were not a direct cause of a change in the referral pattern. Additional support for this notion is provided by the fact that Ochsner Medical Center, a 473-bed acute care facility (and the other major chest pain center in the greater New Orleans metropolitan area), remained open during the entire post-Katrina era, and so any major increase in AMI referrals to TUHSC from other areas of New Orleans is unlikely.\n\n【75】In the AMI population at TUHSC, marked increases in several cardiovascular and psychosocial risk factors were observed. Increases in traditional risk factors such as smoking and hyperlipidemia as well as lack of health insurance are likely to contribute to increased incidence of AMI, even though not immediately. Other risk factors including unemployment, substance abuse, and psychiatric disease could have a more immediate effect on the occurrence of AMI. In fact, it was recently reported that the loss of employment was found to be an independent risk factor for AMI that is equivalent to diabetes and smoking,\n\n【76】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【77】The cumulative effect of unemployment on risks for acute myocardial infarction.\n\n【78】a notion supported by recent studies that have found both increased AMI incidence\n\n【79】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【80】Greek socio-economic crisis and incidence of acute myocardial infarction in Southwestern Pelopennese.\n\n【81】and cardiovascular mortality\n\n【82】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【83】Socio economic crisis and mortality.

All these risk factors possess the potential to interact with chronic stress, which itself has been linked to adverse cardiac events through several mechanisms including coronary atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, decreased fibrinolysis, and increased inflammation and clotting activity.\n\n【85】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【86】Role of sympathoadrenal medullary activation in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis.\n\n【87】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【88】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【89】Mental stress induces transient endothelial dysfunction in humans.\n\n【90】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【91】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【92】Effects of psychological stress and psychiatric disorders on blood coagulation and fibrinolysis: a biobehavioral pathway to coronary artery disease?\n\n【93】Additional evidence that stress may have played a role in our patient population is provided by the fact that traditional chronobiological AMI patterns (peaks during stressful times of day and week) were present before Hurricane Katrina but markedly disrupted thereafter. Future studies are warranted to examine the effect of employment status on the timing of symptom onset.\n\n【94】It is important to recognize that the observed population with AMI at TUHSC after Hurricane Katrina is not necessarily representative of the New Orleans population after Hurricane Katrina as a whole. In stark contrast to the observed population in our study, DeSalvo et al\n\n【95】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【96】Health care infrastructure in pos-Katrina New Orleans: a status report.\n\n【97】point out that the New Orleans population after Hurricane Katrina is older, more white, has a higher income, and is more likely to be insured. In contrast to our study of AMI patients at TUHSC, a study by Beaudoin\n\n【98】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【99】Hurricane Katrina: addictive behavior trends and predictors.\n\n【100】found that the smoking rate increased by only 1% after Hurricane Katrina. In contrast, 2 demographic characteristics are universally reported in demographic studies after Hurricane Katrina: (1) high rates of psychological stress (31% among adults in affected regions),\n\n【101】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【102】Health care infrastructure in pos-Katrina New Orleans: a status report.\n\n【103】posttraumatic stress disorder (19%),\n\n【104】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【105】Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in a New Orleans workforce following Hurricane Katrina.\n\n【106】and a nearly 3-fold increase in suicide rate\n\n【107】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【108】Hurricane Katrina Community Advisory Group  \nMental illness and suicidality after Hurricane Katrina.\n\n【109】 and (2) lack of access to health care as caused by the largest efflux of health care workforce in US history.\n\n【110】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【111】Health care infrastructure in pos-Katrina New Orleans: a status report.\n\n【112】Such findings suggest that certain population subgroups may be more susceptible to stressful events as well as lack of health care access, a hypothesis that should be examined in future studies.\n\n【113】In addition to the dramatic population changes in the city of New Orleans, the data presented herein are subject to several other methodological limitations. First, all data were conducted retrospectively. However, given the inherent unpredictability of natural disasters, it would be difficult to design a similar study in truly prospective fashion. Second, it could be argued that the observed increase in AMI was secondary to other factors such as takotsubo cardiomyopathy or cocaine-induced vasospasm. Although these 2 conditions may have played a role, they are unlikely to have a major effect on our data because more than 85% of the study patients had coronary arteriography performed, of which more than 90% had more than 50% stenosis in 1 or more vessels.\n\n【114】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【115】Effect of Hurricane Katrina on chronobiology at onset of acute myocardial infarction during the subsequent three years.\n\n【116】Third, we excluded from our chronobiological analysis patients in whom the time of onset of symptoms of AMI was not recorded (∼25% of the patients with AMI). We believe that this deficiency in our data was most probably random (eg, omission of the time of onset of symptoms by a busy house officer) and unlikely to have created any systematic bias. Finally, it should be pointed out that our data on AMI incidence are potentially weakened by discordant sample sizes. In particular, there is a large discrepancy between the number of AMI admissions before and after Hurricane Katrina, which we believe, at least in part, may be due to an increase in the overall incidence of AMI in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. Admittedly, changes in factors such as population density, demographic characteristics, and referral patterns may have played an important role in this apparent increase. Unfortunately, AMI incidence data could be obtained only during the 2 years before Katrina owing to the unavailability of hospital admission data before that time, which limited our comparison with pre-Katrina numbers. However, the fact that the chronobiological patterns (which were collected 6 years before Hurricane Katrina) have also changed suggests that the alterations we have observed may not be due to artifact.\n\n【117】Despite numerous limitations, we hope that the data presented herein may provide a framework for the potential of increased cardiac risk associated with a city devastated by a natural disaster. Apparently, even a society as diverse and vibrant as New Orleans can be so totally disrupted that 6 years later AMI incidence was still on the rise (3 times higher than that before Hurricane Katrina) and the timing of events was just barely beginning to revert to previous patterns. In fact, we believe that the consistency of our data over the 6-year post-Katrina period help validate our findings. It has been suggested that the establishment of electronic health records and the coordinated allocation of medications and medical supplies may provide substantial benefit in terms of medication availability and access to health information in the wake of a disaster.\n\n【118】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【119】Providing continuity of care for chronic diseases in the aftermath of Katrina: from field experience to policy recommendations.\n\n【120】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【121】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【122】Development of a disaster cardiovascular prevention network.\n\n【123】However, the long-lasting effects reported in this study indicate that a few months of aid cannot be expected to have a lasting effect on an area devastated by a catastrophe of the magnitude of hurricanes such as Katrina or Sandy. Major commitments from various governing agencies to provide years of aid will be required to restore these areas to their predisaster status. Future studies will hopefully continue to explore the complex relationship between natural disasters and acute cardiac events.\n\n【124】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【125】This retrospective study of patients with AMI at TUHSC finds that the effect of natural disasters on the incidence and timing of AMI may persist for at least a 6-year period. These findings may be related to various factors including population shifts, alterations in the health care system, and the effects of chronic stress and associated behaviors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

In some part, controversy occurs because of the years of study generally required to determine the effect of dietary modifications on morbidity and mortality. Perhaps as a result, association studies have proliferated in this area to replace randomized controlled trials. However, the field of nephrology in particular has learned a series of “tough lessons” as a result of relying on observational data and is now emphasizing the need for randomized controlled studies to dictate clinical practice. With this background, DiNicolantonio et al bring forward several interesting observations that merit additional comment.\n\n【1】DiNicolantonio et al claim that reducing salt intake may increase renin, aldosterone, adrenaline, noradrenaline, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. Although the examination of these associations of dietary sodium intake with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is of interest, the primary consideration should be hard end points such as mortality and not just an association with renin levels. The potential issue of the effect of a low-salt diet on insulin levels is also mentioned, but perhaps caloric intake in our modern society should be considered the primary cause of hyperinsulinemia and not a low-salt diet. In addition, clinical outcomes—not necessarily associations with insulin levels—should be the preferred end point when determining the optimal mode of sodium management in patients who have (or are at risk for) diabetes mellitus.\n\n【2】DiNicolantonio et al quote a meta-analysis by Graudal et al\n\n【3】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【4】Effects of sodium restriction on blood pressure, renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterols, and triglyceride: a meta-analysis.\n\n【5】that derived data from sudden and large reductions in salt intake and ignored contrary evidence.\n\n【6】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【7】Effect of lower sodium intake on health: systematic review and meta-analyses.\n\n【8】The underlying rationale for the inconsistent findings in the report by Graudal et al is that a drastic reduction in dietary sodium intake can lead to unfavorable metabolic and neurohormonal alterations, which could promote insulin resistance, lipid abnormalities, and increased cardiovascular risk through a compensatory activation of the sympathetic nervous system and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (activation that is proportional to the degree of sodium reduction).\n\n【9】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【10】Effects of sodium restriction on blood pressure, renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterols, and triglyceride: a meta-analysis.\n\n【11】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【12】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【13】Short- and long-term neuroadrenergic effects of moderate dietary sodium restriction in essential hypertension.\n\n【14】The theory seems to be valid only for an extremely low sodium intake\n\n【15】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【16】Dietary sodium intake and mortality: the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I).\n\n【17】and not for the 2300 mg/d recommended for the general population.\n\n【18】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【19】Moderate salt reduction in the United States is unlikely to have a major impact on iodine status or exercise-associated hyponatremia.

This finding is concerning and runs counter to the aim of the standards. It may be helpful to point out some limitations of the study. One is its predominant focus on the numeric limits. This ignores the focus on safety and quality, supervision, teamwork, transitions of care, alertness management, and residents' professional development. The authors do not report program directors' comments on these elements of the standards, which were added in response to input from experts in quality and safety, fatigue and alertness management, and the medical community at large, who suggested the standards needed to go beyond a set of numeric limits that would “make care safe and learning effective” and optimize residents' professional development. One enhancement to the 2010 standards is that residents are allowed to remain and care for their patients when it is important from a patient safety, educational, or humanitarian consideration.\n\n【4】Another limitation is that the survey was completed in July 2010, two months before the ACGME released the final standards. At the same time Antiel et al fielded their instrument, the ACGME sought input from the education community and received comments from more than 1000 organizations and individuals. In late August 2010, the ACGME Task Force made minor yet important revisions to the standards, including no longer stipulating that the frequency of in-house call could not be averaged. An article from the same survey data shows that, other than the 16-hour limit for first-year residents, this standard generated the most negative reactions.\n\n【5】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【6】ACGME duty-hour recommendations—a national survey of residency program directors.\n\n【7】The ACGME learned the same from feedback from the education community, which led to a return to the time averaging permitted under the standards currently in effect.\n\n【8】Finally, although program directors' perceptions of the standards are important, real benefit will come from work to test interventions that enhance resident learning and acquisition of competence under the standards. This includes the work by McCoy et al\n\n【9】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【10】Effect of 16-hour duty periods on patient care and resident education.\n\n【11】published in the same issue of the _Proceedings_ . Their article showed that implementation of a night float system compliant with the 16-hour limit had no negative effect on quality of care metrics, including length of stay, readmissions, and mortality, and that a small increase in intensive care unit transfers may represent appropriate decisions by alert residents to move patients to a higher level of care. This kind of work makes a major contribution to the duty hour literature by exploring ways to enhance learning and patient care.\n\n【12】The science on sleep and performance, despite its limitations, appears incontrovertible to the public, which expects an alert physician. Residents make up approximately one-seventh of the physicians in the United States. As the accreditor for graduate medical education, the ACGME's role is to promote trust by seeking to bridge the gulf between public expectations for an alert physician and educators' expectations for educational time and rigor to ensure that graduates are prepared for independent practice. Ignoring public concern about resident fatigue carries the risk of public distrust and the threat of legislation ending a cherished tradition—the privilege of professional self-regulation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Zinc and copper are either bound to metallothionein and stored inside enterocytes or exist in an unbound state. Bound complexes are shed intra- luminally and excreted as enterocytes turn over. Unbound zinc and copper are absorbed into the portal circulation.\n\n【55】Metallothionein expression is regulated by dietary zinc content alone. When large amounts of dietary zinc are ingested, metallothionein expression increases, more zinc is bound to metallothionein, and more zinc-metallothionein complexes are excreted. Because of the difference in binding affinities between zinc and copper (copper binds metallothionein with greater affinity), a potential for pronounced copper excretion exists. Therefore, a substantial increase in zinc ingestion potentially would cause a dramatic decrease in copper absorption.\n\n【56】REPORT OF A CASE\n----------------\n\n【57】A 27-year-old man with no remarkable medical history presented to his primary care physician because of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion of 4 weeks’ duration. He was unable to work for 7 days due to weakness. The patient had no fever or recent infectious symptoms, but he recalled a single episode of night sweats 1 week before admission. Initially, he admitted to taking a daily multiple vitamin, along with vitamin E, vitamin A, topical benzoyl peroxide, and occasionally ginseng. He was taking no prescription medications. His father died of coronary artery disease at age 72 years, and his mother has breast cancer. The patient is a commodity stock trader, nonsmoker, and binge drinker (10 beers per weekend) who has no risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). A review of systems was remarkable for a 4.5-kg weight loss during the past month.\n\n【58】On physical examination, the patient's pulse was 88 beats/min, blood pressure was 100/50 mm Hg, respirations were 14/min, and temperature was 37.8°C. His conjunctivae and skin were remarkably pale, and no facial pustules or comedones were noted. He had a systolic ejection murmur radiating to his neck. The patient had no hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or palpable lymph nodes, and stool from a rectal examination was negative for occult blood.\n\n【59】The patient's initial complete blood cell count was remarkable for hemoglobin of 5.0 g/dL, hematocrit of 14.7%, total leukocyte count of 1.2 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (5% neutrophils, 70% lymphocytes, 25% monocytes), and a mean corpuscular volume of 85.7 fL. Liver function panel, electrolyte level, and heterophile antibody test were normal; findings on an electrocardiogram and a chest radiograph were normal. He was admitted for further evaluation.\n\n【60】A more focused inquiry into the patient's medication history revealed that he had been taking the following nutritional supplements: vitamin E, 1200 IU/d; vitamin A, 60,000 IU/d; 1 multiple vitamin tablet a day; and zinc gluconate, 850 to 1000 mg/d for the past year (recommended daily allowance, 15 mg). A year before presentation the patient saw a chiropractor for back pain and acne. He was referred to a textbook of remedies in the chiropractor's office from which he learned that zinc and vitamin A are therapeutic for acne. He also read that zinc may cause copper deficiency as an adverse effect but elected to take daily zinc gluconate treatment in low doses. After several weeks of poor response, the patient dramatically increased the dose to more than fifteen 50-mg tablets and noted substantial improvement in his acne.\n\n【61】On admission, the patient's serum zinc level was 3.18 µg/mL (reference range shown parenthetically) (0.66-1.10 µg/mL), serum copper level was 0.10 µg/mL (0.75-1.45 µ g/mL), and serum ceruloplasmin was less than 10 mg/dL (22-61 mg/dL) (zinc and copper levels were measured by Mayo Medical Laboratories, Rochester, Minn). His reticulocyte count was zero per high-power field, and serum vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> , red blood cell folate, and iron studies were normal. Immunologic assays for hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV were negative. The patient declined to undergo a bone marrow biopsy, but the peripheral blood smear was unremarkable except for neutropenia, microcytosis, and absence of ringed sideroblasts.\n\n【62】Initially, the patient was placed on neutropenic precautions (strict hand washing, private room, no fresh fruits or vegetables), and zinc was discontinued. Neoplastic and infectious etiologies were strongly considered until the patient admitted to taking large doses of zinc. Thereafter, copper sulfate was initiated intravenously at 2 mg/d.\n\n【63】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【64】Copper Sulfate. MICROMEDEX(R) Healthcare Series.\n\n【65】On day 2 of hospitalization, the patient had an episode of neutropenic fever and was empirically treated with intravenous ceftazidime and gentamicin. The evaluation of neu- tropenic fever included a lumbar puncture that was unrevealing and computed tomography of the sinuses that revealed right frontal sinus opacification consistent with acute sinusitis. From day 2 to day 9, the patient was treated with pseudoephedrine and oximetazoline nasal spray, and intravenous clindamycin was added for anaerobic coverage of sinusitis. Repeated evaluations by an otolaryngologist were unremarkable. Despite intravenous copper therapy, the patient's zinc level, copper level, and red and white blood cell counts remained the same. He also remained febrile. Subcutaneous human granulocyte colony- stimulating factor was administered from day 5 to day 9, which dramatically raised his white blood cell count and aided in resolution of his neutropenic fever. Before discharge on day 9, the patient was given a transfusion of 2 U of packed red blood cells, his antibiotic regimen was changed to oral amoxicillin/clavulonic acid, and the copper sulfate was changed to an oral regimen (10 mg/d for the first 10 days followed by 2 mg/d for 10 weeks). During the next 3 months, the complete blood cell count, serum copper levels, and zinc levels returned to normal . However, at follow-up the patient admitted to continuing to take zinc supplements because his acne had worsened. He was strongly cautioned against this and was given topical antibiotics instead. To our knowledge, he stopped taking zinc supplementation thereafter.\n\n【66】Figure 1 Top, graphic representation of patient's hematocrit (Hct) and leukocyte (white blood cell \\[WBC\\]) counts (x 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) over time. The mode (intravenous \\[IV\\] or oral \\[PO\\]) and daily copper dose administered over time is shown at the top of the figure. Initially, 2 mg IV per day for 5 days was administered, followed by 10 mg PO per day for 10 days, and finally 2 mg PO per day for 70 days. The steep rise in Hct levels on day 7 (arrow) of hospitalization is attributed to the transfusion of 2 U of packed red blood cells. The rapid rise in WBC count at the same time is due to human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy. Bottom, As expected, serum zinc and copper levels measured over 90 days return to normal with zinc discontinuation and copper supplementation.\n\n【67】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【68】We want to emphasize 2 important points from this case of zinc toxicity. First, patients taking large doses of dietary supplements may be exposed to substantial harm; therefore, an exhaustive list of dietary supplements should be a part of the medical history. Second, patients may be unaware of this harmful potential, and physicians need to take a more active role in educating patients and preventing such events from occurring.\n\n【69】Our patient failed to give a history of consumption of zinc supplements at the initial presentation. A recent report indicates that up to 61% of outpatients seen at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn, use dietary supplements; however, only half of those provided that information in the initial history, and the other half admitted to it only after answering a detailed questionnaire.\n\n【70】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【71】Underreporting the use of dietary supplements and nonprescription medications among patients undergoing a periodic health examination.\n\n【72】In fact, dietary supplements often are not considered medications or drugs by patients or physicians, and such supplements are clearly subjected to less scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration. There fore, patient underreporting and physician underinquiring about supplements are not surprising. A more detailed inquiry into dietary supplement use at physicians’ offices is a necessary first step in prevention of adverse effects, as is patient education about the potential for adverse effects and drug-drug interactions in taking dietary supplements, herbal medications, and over-the-counter medications.\n\n【73】Because of widespread use of supplements and their harmful potential, Zeisel\n\n【74】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【75】Regulation of “neutraceuticals”.\n\n【76】has called for tighter regulation. Although the debate over this issue is sure to continue, we submit that better history-taking and simple patient education are the most logical first steps.\n\n【77】Our patient sought alternative medical care at a chiropractor's office before seeking care from an allopathic physician. It is perhaps ironic that the therapy that he chose for acne, oral zinc and vitamin A, may be loosely based on evidence-based medicine literature.\n\n【78】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【79】Effects of oral zinc and vitamin A in acne.\n\n【80】The use of complementary and alternative medicine in the United States also has substantially increased over the past half century, with up to 70% of a cohort of Americans visiting alternative medicine practitioners.\n\n【81】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【82】Long-term trends in the use of complementary and alternative medical therapies in the United States.\n\n【83】A lack of conventional physician awareness regarding these therapies has been identified— in some cases as high as 72%—as well as a relative failure to teach medical students about alternative medicine therapies.\n\n【84】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【85】Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990-1997: results of a follow-up national survey.\n\n【86】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【87】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【88】Unconventional medicine in the United States: prevalence, costs, and patterns of use.\n\n【89】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【90】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【91】Courses involving complementary and alternative medicine at US medical schools.\n\n【92】Clearly, a need for inquiry into alternative medicine uses and better communication with patients is reemphasized by these data. It is also clear that educating current and future physicians about alternative medicine therapies and social trends in their use is urgently needed.\n\n【93】In conclusion, our case exposes a complex interplay between conventional and alternative medicine, patient- physician communication, supplemental zinc benefits and harms, and the competitive relationship between zinc and copper absorption. When taken in large doses, supplements clearly can be harmful. Because of such wide availability and use of supplements, cases such as this one will likely be repeated. Therefore, careful history-taking, patient instruction, and education of the next generation of physicians are keys to prevention.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Of those 17 patients, 10 (59%) had paradoxical increases in serum potassium levels greater than 0.1 mEq/L ( _P_ <.05), with the average increase being 0.15 mEq/L. The potassium level gradually decreased for approximately 5 minutes but not lower than the baseline.

Nevertheless, the clinical importance of this phenomenon is debatable. β-Agonists are not recommended as monotherapy or as initial therapy; thus, a paradoxical increase in potassium would likely be ameliorated with concurrent administration of insulin, glucose, and calcium. It is interesting that the transient increase in potassium levels after β-agonist administration occurred in only 59% of patients in the report by Mandelberg et al, suggesting that some interpatient variability of α-adrenergic response might exist.

His medical history was notable for Crohn disease diagnosed in 1994, complicated by ileocolonic resection (20 cm of ileum and 15 cm of the right colon removed) in 2001. He had been taking mesalamine for 2 years, and although the prednisone dose was increased over the previous 3 months because of recurrent abdominal pain, it produced minimal relief. Computed tomography (CT) revealed fistulizing distal ileal Crohn disease with abscess formation.\n\n【1】The patient was hospitalized; ertapenem and vancomycin were initiated, and 2 trials of CT-guided abscess drainage were attempted but failed. Twelve days after admission, the patient underwent laparotomy for abscess drainage without any surgical complications. On postoperative day 1, his vital signs deteriorated, with a temperature of 39.3°C, respiratory rate of 30 breaths/min, heart rate of 108 beats/min, and blood pressure of 130/80 mm Hg. Pertinent findings on examination included mild respiratory distress and rapid heart rate but regular rhythm and no murmurs. His skin was warm to touch, and no rashes or edema were noted on examination. A right lower quadrant drain was in place with minimal blood-tinged drainage. Evaluation included chest CT with contrast medium, which ruled out pulmonary embolism, and blood cultures were obtained. Intravenous ketorolac, 30 mg every 6 hours, was initiated for fever and postoperative pain management. Blood culture results remained negative after 48 hours, and the vancomycin and ertapenem regimen was continued. On postoperative day 3, laboratory testing yielded the following notable findings (reference ranges provided parenthetically): hemoglobin, 7.1 g/dL (13.5-17.5 g/dL); white blood cells (WBCs), 14.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (3.5-10.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with 13.8% neutrophils; sodium, 136 mmol/L (135-145 mmol/L); potassium, 3.9 mmol/L (3.6-5.2 mmol/L); serum urea nitrogen, 12 mg/dL (8-24 mg/dL); and creatinine, 1.6 mg/dL (0.8-1.3 mg/dL).\n\n【2】*   1.\n\n【3】    **In patients with Crohn disease, which _one_ of the following is the _most_ commonly associated renal finding?**\n\n【4】    *   a.\n\n【5】        Renal cystic disease\n\n【6】    *   b.\n\n【7】        Small vessel vasculitis\n\n【8】    *   c.\n\n【9】        Medullary sponge kidney\n\n【10】    *   d.\n\n【11】        Nephrolithiasis\n\n【12】    *   e.\n\n【13】        Diabetic nephropathy\n\n【14】Patients with Crohn disease are at considerable risk for multiple lower genitourinary tract and renal parenchymal and interstitial diseases. Renal cystic disease encompasses a wide spectrum of both genetic and acquired forms of renal cysts and has not been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Small vessel vasculitis may be associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and manifest as microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatous polyangiitis, or Churg-Strauss syndrome. There have been case reports of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody–associated vasculitis in patients with IBD, but this association is rare. Medullary sponge kidney is a congenital abnormality of the collecting tubules in the medullary region causing cystic dilatation. Medullary sponge kidney has a benign course but is associated with hematuria, nephrolithiasis, and recurrent urinary tract infections. An association with IBD has not been reported. Nephrolithiasis is the most commonly associated renal disease in patients with IBD. Patients with IBD have a 12% to 28% incidence of nephrolithiasis compared with 5% in the general population.\n\n【15】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【16】Renal manifestations and complications of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【17】Nephrolithiasis tends to be more common in patients with Crohn disease and a history of ileocolonic disease, as in this patient. Diabetic nephropathy has been reported in association with prolonged corticosteroid use in patients with IBD who have development of diabetes, but it does not have a unique association with IBD itself.\n\n【18】This patient had no history of chronic kidney disease, proteinuria, hematuria, or acute kidney injury (AKI), and his baseline creatinine concentration ranged between 0.8 g/dL and 1.0 g/dL before the current admission. He had never passed a kidney stone. Abdominal imaging studies performed a few years before admission revealed no renal abnormalities. During the current hospitalization, AKI developed and the creatinine level increased to 1.6 g/dL within 48 hours and peaked at 2.1 g/dL. Urinary output declined to 500 mL in 24 hours the day preceding the increase in creatinine.\n\n【19】*   2.\n\n【20】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ next step in the management of this patient’s AKI?**\n\n【21】    *   a.\n\n【22】        Discontinue ertapenem and vancomycin\n\n【23】    *   b.\n\n【24】        Discontinue ketorolac\n\n【25】    *   c.\n\n【26】        Initiate _N_ \\-acetylcysteine\n\n【27】    *   d.\n\n【28】        Obtain vancomycin trough level\n\n【29】    *   e.\n\n【30】        Repeat electrolyte panel\n\n【31】For several nephrotoxic drugs, administration can be suspended, the pattern of administration changed, or another less toxic or nontoxic drug used instead. However, this strategy cannot be used for all potential nephrotoxic medications. Because the patient meets the criteria for severe sepsis, discontinuing antibiotics may jeopardize his clinical status. Evaluation for antibiotic-induced nephrotoxicity must be pursued before discontinuation. The nephrotoxicity of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is mostly attributable to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.\n\n【32】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【33】Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and acute renal failure in elderly persons.\n\n【34】They disrupt the compensatory vasodilation response of renal prostaglandins to vasoconstrictor hormones released in the context of sepsis.\n\n【35】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【36】Significant acute kidney injury due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: inpatient setting.\n\n【37】These aberrations in renal hemodynamics result in decreased cortical blood flow, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and acute deterioration of renal function. They can also induce acute interstitial nephritis (AIN). Because the patient has had development of AKI and there are other less nephrotoxic medications for pain control available, the most reasonable next step in management is to discontinue ketorolac. _N_ \\-acetylcysteine may reduce the nephrotoxicity of contrast media through antioxidant and vasodilatory effects when given before administration of contrast but not after the onset of AKI.\n\n【38】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【39】N-acetylcysteine in the prevention of radiocontrast-induced nephropathy.\n\n【40】Its use is still controversial for prevention of contrast-induced AKI. Determining vancomycin trough levels and repeating the electrolyte panel will be helpful to guide next steps, but the most important immediate next step is discontinuation of ketorolac.\n\n【41】Ketorlac was discontinued. Further abdominal imaging revealed a fluid collection extending from the right subdiaphragmatic region to the right lower quadrant that was concerning for persistent abscess vs bowel leak as the likely cause for the persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The vancomycin trough level was monitored and noted to be elevated at 30.1 μg/mL (<15 μg/mL). Vancomycin was withheld because of the supratherapeutic levels, and the ertapenem dose was adjusted for renal impairment. Nephrology consultation was requested.\n\n【42】*   3.\n\n【43】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _best test_ for evaluation of this patient’s AKI?**\n\n【44】    *   a.\n\n【45】        Urinalysis\n\n【46】    *   b.\n\n【47】        Urinary eosinophil measurement\n\n【48】    *   c.\n\n【49】        Complement level determination\n\n【50】    *   d.\n\n【51】        Kidney ultrasonography\n\n【52】    *   e.\n\n【53】        Measurement of the fractional excretion of sodium (FENa)\n\n【54】Urinalysis is the most important step in the evaluation of AKI. The urinalysis includes 2 components, an analysis for proteinuria, leukocyte esterase, glucosuria, bilirubin, and urinary pH and microscopic examination of the urinary sediment, which evaluates for cells, crystals, and casts.

In clinical practice, urinary eosinophils are often measured to help guide the clinician in determining whether AIN may be the cause of AKI, and based on clinical impressions from nephrologists, sensitivities and specificities for urinary eosinophils have ranged from 40% to 91% and 52% to 95%, respectively.\n\n【58】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【59】Utility of urine eosinophils in the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis.\n\n【60】Recent work evaluating the diagnostic utility of urinary eosinophil measurement compared with kidney biopsy, the criterion standard for diagnosis of AIN, found that the presence of urinary eosinophils was not specific for AIN and may occur in many renal disease processes; thus, it may not be useful to differentiate AIN from acute tubular necrosis.\n\n【61】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【62】Utility of urine eosinophils in the diagnosis of acute interstitial nephritis.\n\n【63】Complement levels may be helpful when an immune deposit glomerulonephritis is suspected, but its use should be based on clinical suspicion in conjunction with the presence of RBCs on urinalysis. Kidney ultrasonography is useful to evaluate for the presence of hydronephrosis and kidney stones; however, it should not be the first step in AKI evaluation. The FENa is commonly used to differentiate prerenal vs intrarenal causes of AKI. However, the FENa has only been found to reflect a sodium-avid state or prerenal state in oliguric cases of AKI. Moreover, in early phases of AKI, both intrarenal and extrarenal causes of AKI have been associated with low FENa values resembling those in the prerenal state.\n\n【64】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【65】Fractional excretion of sodium: exceptions to its diagnostic value.\n\n【66】The cause of AKI should be based on the global presentation including history, clinical examination, urinalysis, and response to volume resuscitation.\n\n【67】Urinalysis revealed granular and hyaline casts, 4 to 10 WBCs per high-power field, and more than 180 RBCs per high-power field. The protein to creatinine ratio and albumin levels were both normal. Gram stain with urine culture yielded negative results. On the basis of the clinical scenario and evidence of granular casts on urinalysis, the cause of AKI in this patient was likely multifactorial due to acute tubular necrosis from several risk factors: severe sepsis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and recent contrast media exposure. The degree of hematuria noted was concerning for a secondary process.\n\n【68】*   4.\n\n【69】    **On the basis of this patient’s clinical presentation, which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ explanation for the hematuria?**\n\n【70】    *   a.\n\n【71】        Nephrolithiasis\n\n【72】    *   b.\n\n【73】        Bladder malignant neoplasm\n\n【74】    *   c.\n\n【75】        AIN\n\n【76】    *   d.\n\n【77】        IgA nephropathy\n\n【78】    *   e.\n\n【79】        Postinfectious glomerulonephritis\n\n【80】Nephrolithiasis can be asymptomatic and can cause marked hematuria in the absence of proteinuria. This patient has several risk factors for nephrolithiasis including Crohn disease, history of ileocolonic involvement, and ileal resection.\n\n【81】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【82】Renal and urologic complications of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【83】Considering the patient’s young age and no smoking history, a bladder malignant neoplasm is less likely to explain this degree of hematuria. Although both RBCs and WBCs can be present in AIN, WBCs are usually present in greater proportion than RBCs. IgA nephropathy usually manifests as microscopic hematuria in association with proteinuria and often presents at the onset of IBD or during a relapse. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis is an immunologic response of the kidney that occurs after a nonrenal infection, often with streptococci, and is associated with low complement levels.\n\n【84】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【85】An update on acute postinfectious glomerulonephritis worldwide.\n\n【86】Proteinuria is an important hallmark of this disease process.\n\n【87】The presence of RBCs on urinalysis prompted measurements of total complement and C3 and C4 levels. The results were normal, which in conjunction with the absence of any proteinuria makes the diagnosis of postinfectious glomerulonephritis less likely. A review of the patient’s abdominal contrast CT on admission revealed multiple kidney stones in a pattern consistent with medullary nephrocalcinosis, likely explaining the hematuria. The patient’s renal function recovered to baseline within 4 days after the creatinine concentration peaked. He underwent exploratory laparotomy with ileocolonic resection and ileostomy for an anastomotic leak. The patient recovered and was dismissed on the 23rd day of hospitalization.\n\n【88】At follow-up 2 months after dismissal, the patient’s creatinine level remained stable. Urinalysis continued to show hematuria and no proteinuria or microalbuminuria, consistent with his underlying medullary nephrocalcinosis. He underwent a 24-hour urinary metabolic evaluation, which yielded 2.9 L of urine, normal urinary sodium and calcium levels, low urinary pH (5.4), hypocitraturia, hypomagnesuria, hyperuricosuria, and increased risk for precipitation of calcium oxalate and uric acid crystals.\n\n【89】*   5.\n\n【90】    **On the basis of the 24-hour urinary metabolic evaluation, which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ treatment?**\n\n【91】    *   a.\n\n【92】        Penicillamine\n\n【93】    *   b.\n\n【94】        Sodium bicarbonate\n\n【95】    *   c.\n\n【96】        Potassium citrate\n\n【97】    *   d.\n\n【98】        Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n【99】    *   e.\n\n【100】        Calcium carbonate\n\n【101】This patient has several urinary metabolic risk factors for nephrolithiasis. In addition to careful adherence to high-fluid, low-sodium, low-purine dietary restriction, medical therapy is warranted to decrease the likelihood of future stone formation. Penicillamine is a chelating agent used for the treatment of cystine nephrolithiasis. It forms penicillamine-cysteine disulfide bonds that are easily excreted compared with cysteine-cysteine bonds. There is no role for the use of penicillamine in this patient. Sodium bicarbonate therapy is helpful in patients with evidence of non–anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is often present in patients with chronic diarrhea. This patient does not have evidence of acidemia, and therefore, treatment with sodium bicarbonate is not warranted at this juncture. Potassium citrate is the mainstay of therapy for patients with hypocitraturia and uric acid crystals. Citrate inhibits stone formation and alkalinizes the urine, which increases uric acid crystal solubility and decreases uric acid stone formation. Thiazidelike diuretics are useful in patients with hypercalciuria and calcium oxalate stones. This patient has a normal urinary calcium level. Calcium carbonate is often needed for supplementation in patients with low urinary calcium and high urinary oxalate levels, as can be seen in patients with enteric hyperoxaluria. However, this patient has normal urinary calcium and oxalate levels, and therefore, calcium supplementation is not helpful.\n\n【102】The patient was encouraged to continue with high fluid intake and a low-sodium diet and was educated about a low-fat, low-purine diet. Potassium citrate tablets were prescribed.\n\n【103】Discussion\n----------\n\n【104】Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are 2 distinct types of IBD and represent a state of chronic T-cell–mediated inflammation that is heavily influenced by genetic predisposition and environmental and lifestyle factors. Up to 23% of patients with IBD will experience lower genitourinary tract and/or kidney involvement, namely in the form of fistulizing disease, interstitial renal disease, and nephrolithiasis.\n\n【105】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【106】Renal and urologic complications of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【107】IgA nephropathy has been reported as one of the most common histopathologic findings on kidney biopsies of patients with IBD and is significantly more frequent in these patients than in those without IBD (24% vs 8%; _P_ <.01).\n\n【108】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【109】The histopathologic spectrum of kidney biopsies in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【110】Several other intrarenal causes of kidney disease have been reported in IBD—AA (previously called secondary) amyloidosis, which has been linked to chronic inflammation; interstitial nephritis, which has been associated with salicylate therapy as an idiosyncratic drug reaction (necessitating regular monitoring of renal function); and in some reports as a possible direct complication of IBD independent of treatment.\n\n【111】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【112】Tubulointerstitial nephritis as an extraintestinal manifestation of Crohn's disease.\n\n【113】Nephrolithiasis in IBD may be asymptomatic, complicated by ureteral obstruction and hydronephrosis, or associated with crystal deposition in renal parenchyma leading to interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Patients with IBD have a 12% to 28% incidence of nephrolithiasis compared with 5% in the general population.\n\n【114】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【115】Renal manifestations and complications of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【116】Patients with Crohn disease and ileocolonic involvement are more likely to have development of nephrolithiasis than patients with ulcerative colitis or colonic or ileal disease. Two types of nephrolithiasis predominate in IBD: calcium oxalate and uric acid stones. There are dietary, metabolic, and genetic risk factors that predispose to calcium oxalate stones including hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hypocitraturia, and strong family history. Specific to gastrointestinal disorders, patients with jejunoileal bypass for obesity and pancreatic insufficiency are at highest risk. First, in patients with a diseased or resected ileum, there is decreased bile acid absorption, which consequently leads to fat malabsorption. Calcium is bound by the intestinal fat through the process of saponification, so there is less calcium available to bind to oxalate. Thus, there is increased oxalate absorption via the colon, also known as enteric hyperoxaluria. Second, deconjugated bile salts have toxic effects on the colonic mucosa that may directly enhance oxalate absorption. Third, several biological inhibitors of kidney stones such as citrate and magnesium have been found to be low in the urine of patients with IBD. Uric acid stones occur predominantly in the context of chronic diarrhea, which may lead to non–anion gap metabolic acidosis that then drives increased urinary acid excretion. Low urinary pH is a major risk for uric acid crystallization and stone formation. Moreover, most patients with chronic diarrhea are at risk for hypovolemia, and low urinary volume is another important risk factor for stone formation.\n\n【117】In evaluating patients with nephrolithiasis, imaging studies and a complete urinary metabolic evaluation are needed to determine stone type, size, location, metabolic activity, and risk factors. Computed tomography with a stone protocol helps differentiate calcium- from noncalcium-based stones and provides insight into whether stone burden necessitates urological intervention. Review of previous imaging studies will help determine if stones are metabolically active. Urinary metabolic evaluation for sodium, calcium, oxalate, magnesium, and uric acid will help individualize the management approach to minimize future stone formation. For patients with calcium oxalate stones, the focus of treatment is to increase the luminal calcium concentration with calcium carbonate supplementation and dietary restriction of fat and oxalate.\n\n【118】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【119】Hyperoxaluria and renal calculi.\n\n【120】For those with uric acid stones, the key treatment is alkalinization of the urine with potassium citrate, and if hyperuricosuria is present, allopurinol and a purine-restricted diet are recommended. Close follow-up is essential to monitor nephrolithiasis risk factors, adjust treatment, and assess for changes in stone type over time. Patients with IBD and risk factors for nephrolithiasis benefit from regular urinalysis to assess for hematuria. Patients with metabolically active or symptomatic kidney stone disease will benefit from tailored treatment to decrease further stone formation and risk for associated complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Exclusion criteria included human immunodeficiency virus infection, lung cancer, active tuberculosis, hospitalization within 7 days, length of stay (LOS) more than 14 days, and requirement of mechanical ventilation. All patients were cared for by either a full-time hospitalist or a primary care physician. Data collected included patient insurance status, variables to calculate each patient's Pneumonia Severity Index score, initial antibiotic selection, door-to-needle time, time to patient stability for switch to oral antibiotics, time to actual switch, unstable variables at discharge, and subspecialty consultation rate.

These features do not fit our patient's clinical situation.\n\n【20】In a patient taking hydrochlorothiazide, thiazide-induced hypercalcemia is usually mild. Thus, thiazide intake per se is rarely the primary cause of a serum calcium level higher than 12 mg/dL. Our patient's calcium level suggests the presence of an underlying disease even if the diagnosis is not suspected before initiation of thiazide.\n\n【21】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【22】Hypercalcemia and primary hyperparathyroidism: prevalence in patients receiving thiazides as detected in a health screen.\n\n【23】Fatigue and malaise may be the initial manifestations of an apathetic form of hyperthyroidism that is found especially in elderly patients.

Diffuse bone loss and vertebral fractures occur in most patients. The serum creatinine value is elevated in more than one half of patients at diagnosis and is higher than 2.0 mg/dL in approximately one fourth of patients. A normocytic, normochromic anemia is seen in nearly two thirds of patients at the time of diagnosis. The presence of mild anemia, hypercalcemia, acute renal failure, and vertebral fracture in our patient suggests MM.\n\n【30】Hypercalcemia that occurs in patients with FHH is usually mild. Mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid cells and kidneys lead to a defective calcium regulation such that higher than normal calcium levels are necessary to suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH) release. Patients with this rare autosomal dominant disorder are not at increased risk of kidney stones. These anticipated findings are incongruent with findings in our patient.\n\n【31】*   2.\n\n【32】    _Which one of the following is the most important factor in the diagnostic work-up of this patient's suspected condition?_\n\n【33】    *   a.\n\n【34】        _PTH_\n\n【35】    *   b.\n\n【36】        _Alkaline phosphatase_\n\n【37】    *   c.\n\n【38】        _Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)_\n\n【39】    *   d.\n\n【40】        _β2-Microglobulin_\n\n【41】    *   e.\n\n【42】        _1,25-Hydroxyvitamin D_\n\n【43】Although there are numerous causes of hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy account for 80% to 90% of the cases,\n\n【44】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【45】Role of assays for parathyroid-hormone-related protein in investigation of hypercalcaemia.\n\n【46】the former accounting for more than 90% of cases in ambulatory patients. Hence, PTH measurement should always be the first step in the laboratory diagnosis of hypercalcemia. However, this is not the most important test in the diagnostic work-up of MM.\n\n【47】More than 95% of the total serum activity of alkaline phosphatase is derived from liver cells and osteoblasts. The quantification of this enzyme as a biochemical index is nonspecific; it is used primarily for screening and follow- up of liver and metabolic bone disease.\n\n【48】Serum protein electrophoresis is an easy to perform screening procedure for M proteins. When a plasma cell disorder is suspected, SPEP should always be performed in combination with immunofixation. Depending on the method, SPEP has a sensitivity of up to 95% and a specificity of 99% for monoclonal gammopathies. Approximately 2% of patients with MM are null excretors of protein, and MM will be diagnosed only with bone marrow biopsy. Nevertheless, SPEP is the most helpful test in this patient in whom we suspect MM. Urinary protein electrophoresis should likewise be performed since the results from this test complement those from SPEP in establishing the diagnosis of various paraproteinemias.\n\n【49】β <sub>2 </sub> \\-Microglobulin measurement is not helpful because it does not distinguish clearly between monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) and myeloma. Likewise, increased levels of β <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin are found in association with various lymphoproliferative disorders\n\n【50】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【51】Serum beta 2 microglobulin in multiple myeloma: a critical review.\n\n【52】 however, β <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin measurement is extremely useful for assessing the prognosis of and response to therapy in patients with MM.\n\n【53】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【54】Plasma cell labeling index and beta 2-microglobulin predict survival independent of thymidine kinase and C-reactive protein in multiple myeloma.\n\n【55】In patients with certain lymphoproliferative and granulomatous diseases, calcitriol is produced in extrarenal sites, probably by macrophages or B cells. This results in elevated serum 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. However, this assay is not vital to the diagnosis of MM.\n\n【56】Serum protein electrophoresis and urinary protein electrophoresis with immunofixation showed no apparent monoclonal protein. Further tests were performed to investigate the etiology of this patient's hypercalcemia.

Because both entities are unlikely given the result of the SPEP and urinary protein electrophoresis, this test is inappropriate.\n\n【74】A skeletal survey is useful for searching for osteolytic lesions in patients with either MM or metastatic carcinoma. However, it is nonspecific and should be used for prognostic staging rather than for diagnosis.\n\n【75】Although MRI is preferred over CT in certain settings, such as in delineating soft tissue abnormalities particularly around bony structures that can produce imaging artifacts on CT, MRI is rarely the first-line diagnostic imaging modality of choice because of cost and technical issues.\n\n【76】Positron emission tomography provides input regarding the metabolic activity of certain lesions, hence suggesting the probability of malignancy. It is generally considered only after suspicious lesions have been identified with standard imaging techniques such as CT. Although use of positron emission tomography in staging tumors and detecting occult malignancy is increasing, its role in evaluating disease remains to be adequately defined.\n\n【77】Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral renal stones. In addition, moderate adenopathy in the gastrohepatic ligament and enlarged periceliac and peripancreatic nodes were present. Chest CT showed no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.\n\n【78】*   4.\n\n【79】    _Which one of the following procedures is the best choice to elucidate the cause of this patient's lymphadenopathy?_\n\n【80】    *   a.\n\n【81】        _Exploratory laparotomy_\n\n【82】    *   b.\n\n【83】        _CT-guided biopsy_\n\n【84】    *   c.\n\n【85】        _Bone marrow aspiration_\n\n【86】    *   d.\n\n【87】        _Gallium citrate Ga 67 lung scan_\n\n【88】    *   e.\n\n【89】        _Indium In scan_\n\n【90】To establish the etiology of lymphadenopathies in general, obtaining a tissue specimen for pathologic diagnosis is the “gold standard.” In this patient who has several intra- peritoneal lymph nodes that are causing no morbid or severe symptoms such as obstruction or pain refractory to medical management, exploratory laparotomy is unwarranted. The risks would outweigh any potential benefit. Biopsy with CT guidance is minimally invasive and is relatively safe and effective. Nevertheless, normal or nonspecific results may be obtained due to sampling error, and further diagnostic or therapeutic measures rely on clinical judgment and overall course of the disease.\n\n【91】Bone marrow aspiration is not used for the diagnosis but rather for disease staging of lymphoma because involvement of the marrow is usually focal. Hence, this test is inappropriate in our patient.\n\n【92】Gallium lung scanning is not recommended for evaluating causes of lymphadenopathy. The test result is not only difficult to interpret but also nonspecific and has low sensitivity. However, it is superior to CT in distinguishing mediastinal fibrosis from active tumor tissue after treatment of lymphomas. Indium scanning images the entire body and is generally used for patients in whom the initial evaluation shows no underlying infection or inflammation. Use of these nuclear imaging scans remains investigational to date.\n\n【93】The patient subsequently underwent fine-needle aspiration of a retroperitoneal lymph node. Noncaseating granulomatous inflammation was seen. Special stains for microorganisms and acid-fast bacilli were negative. The serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was elevated at 81 U/L (7-46 U/L). The purified protein derivative test result was negative.\n\n【94】*   5.\n\n【95】    _At this point, which one of the following diagnoses is most likely in this patient?_\n\n【96】    *   a.\n\n【97】        _Tuberculosis_\n\n【98】    *   b.\n\n【99】        _Sarcoidosis_\n\n【100】    *   c.\n\n【101】        _Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)_\n\n【102】    *   d.\n\n【103】        _Lymphoma_\n\n【104】    *   e.\n\n【105】        _Berylliosis_\n\n【106】Tuberculosis is a mycobacterial infection that has been associated with hypercalcemia and an increased ACE level.\n\n【107】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【108】Elevated serum angiotensin converting enzyme in miliary tuberculosis \\[abstract\\].\n\n【109】However, caseation is the typical histopathologic finding in this entity, which differs from that seen in our patient.\n\n【110】Although the presence of noncaseating granulomas is not diagnostic by itself, the composite of clinical findings such as high levels of calcitriol, hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, negative purified protein derivative test results, and increased ACE levels together with the cytologic evidence makes sarcoidosis the most likely diagnosis.\n\n【111】A differential diagnosis to consider in a patient who presents with fatigue and has anemia and abdominal lymphadenopathy is CLL. Most symptomatic patients have enlarged lymph nodes and splenomegaly. Enlargement of the cervical and supraclavicular nodes occurs more commonly than lymphadenopathy elsewhere. Mesenteric or retroperitoneal involvement is infrequent. Moreover, patients with CLL have demonstrable lymphocytosis in routine complete blood cell counts. Lymph node architecture is diffusely effaced by small lymphocytes. These points argue against the diagnosis of CLL in our patient.\n\n【112】Although elevated serum levels of calcitriol are found in many patients with hypercalcemia who have either high- grade widespread B-cell lymphomas or Hodgkin disease, individual characteristic histopathologic findings distinguish such patients from those with sarcoidosis. Moreover, the ACE level is usually low in patients with malignant lymphomas.\n\n【113】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【114】Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme in malignant lymphomas, leukaemia and multiple myeloma.\n\n【115】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【116】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【117】Noninvasive testing of asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy.\n\n【118】Berylliosis is an antigen-driven pulmonary disease characterized histologically by noncaseating granulomas and mononuclear cell infiltrates and is diagnosed in the presence of beryllium exposure and evidence of beryllium sensitization. However, our patient had findings confined to the peritoneal cavity, incongruous with berylliosis.\n\n【119】After we withheld hydrochlorothiazide and administered aggressive saline diuresis, the patient's hypercalcemia improved, and his serum calcium levels plateaued at 11 to 11.2 mg/dL. Prednisone, 40 mg/d, was then initiated. His serum calcium level normalized within 5 days of institution of prednisone. Corticosteroid use was tapered over 6 months. Repeated CT of the abdomen after treatment showed remarkable regression in the size of the intra- abdominal lymph nodes. Although withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids is a risk factor for exacerbation of psoriasis, this did not occur in our patient.\n\n【120】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【121】First described by Hutchinson in 1877, sarcoidosis has remained an enigma despite progress in accumulating pathologic and clinical data. Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disorder whose etiology remains unknown.\n\n【122】The diagnosis is made by histological evidence of non- caseating epithelioid cell granulomas in support of clinico- radiologic findings and by exclusion of other diseases capable of producing a similar histological or clinical picture. The value of monitoring ACE levels for disease activity remains unclear. However, the ACE level should never be used as the sole indication for initiating treatment.\n\n【123】Hypercalcemia is usually transient in patients with subacute sarcoidosis and may fluctuate in those with chronic sarcoidosis, depending on disease activity. Although hypercalcemia has long been recognized as a complication of sarcoidosis, the importance of hypercalciuria has been less appreciated. In patients with sarcoidosis, hypercalciuria is 3 times more common than hypercalcemia.\n\n【124】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【125】Noninvasive testing of asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy.\n\n【126】In some studies, the frequency of hypercalciuria is 60%.\n\n【127】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【128】Renal involvement in sarcoidosis.\n\n【129】Renal calculi have been found in about 10% of patients with chronic sarcoidosis. Hypercalciuria is slightly more common in men than in women and in white people than in West Indian patients. The mechanism of hypercalciuria appears to be 2-fold: (1) absorptive, associated with elevated serum 1,25- hydroxyvitamin D levels and an abnormally high urinary calcium-creatinine ratio; and (2) resorptive, as evidenced by the association of osteopenia, persistence of hyper- calciuria despite a calcium-poor diet, and association with an osteoclast-activating factor. An osteoclast-activating factor is a bone-reabsorbing substance produced by activated lymphocytes, mononuclear cells, and sarcoid granulomas. These sarcoid granulomas may be responsible for bone resorption.\n\n【130】Corticosteroids have conventionally been the initial treatment of choice, but there is no clear evidence that they modify the course of sarcoidosis despite numerous investigations. However, systemic therapy is clearly indicated in patients with severe organ impairment, such as progressive pulmonary disease. Extrapulmonary involvement of the neurologic, cardiac, and ophthalmologic systems unresponsive to topical agents or in patients with hypercalcemia warrants treatment even when symptoms are minimal because of the deleterious consequences that may ensue. Prednisone, 20 to 40 mg/d, is the drug of choice to reduce the endogenous production of 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D. Institution of corticosteroid therapy causes a decrease in circulating 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum calcium levels within 3 to 5 days. A decrease in the urinary calcium excretion rate occurs within 7 to 10 days.\n\n【131】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【132】Vitamin D, calcium and sarcoidosis.\n\n【133】If the serum calcium level fails to normalize after 2 weeks of corticosteroid therapy, the clinician should exclude the possibility of a coexisting disorder, including hyperparathyroidism, carcinoma, lymphoma, and myeloma. Once the calcium abnormality is controlled, the prednisone dose can be reduced over a period of 4 to 6 weeks. If the patient develops unbearable adverse effects from corticosteroid therapy or treatment fails, chloroquine or hydrochloroquine should be given. The latter 2 drugs are known to reduce serum 1,25- hydroxyvitamin D and calcium concentrations by inhibiting 1a-hydroxylase.\n\n【134】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【135】Effective reduction in the serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and calcium concentration in sarcoidosis-associated hypercalcemia with short-course chloroquine therapy.\n\n【136】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【137】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【138】The effects of chloroquine on serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D and calcium metabolism in sarcoidosis.\n\n【139】Correct answers: 1. _d_ , 2. _c_ , 3. _a_ , 4. _b,_ 5\\. _b_", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Unfortunately, hearing loss is often undiagnosed and untreated. This article summarizes symptoms of typical hearing loss associated with aging and simple screening procedures that can be implemented into a primary care practice. In addition, hearing aid treatment options, including monaural or binaural fitting, size and style, and circuitry and feature options, are reviewed.\n\n【1】Hearing loss affects more than 31.5 million people in the United States\n\n【2】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【3】MarkeTrak VII: hearing loss population tops 31 million people.\n\n【4】and is a major public health issue. As many as 40% of adults older than 65 years have some degree of presbycusis (age-related hearing loss). Furthermore, exposure to intense sounds, such as excessively loud music, occupational noise, or recreational noise (eg, hunting, shooting, or motorcycles) can cause hearing loss or contribute to a decrease in threshold sensitivity due to aging or ear disease.\n\n【5】Because hearing is a critical component of effective communication, loss of hearing can be frustrating. In elderly people, hearing loss may cause considerable social, emotional, and communication dysfunction.\n\n【6】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【7】Association between hearing impairment and the quality of life of elderly individuals.\n\n【8】In 1999, the National Council on the Aging\n\n【9】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【10】The consequences of untreated hearing loss in older persons. The National Council on the Aging , Washington, DC 1999\n\n【11】reported a survey of more than 2000 hearing-impaired adults and their family members or close friends. Respondents with untreated hearing loss were more likely to report depression, paranoia, and a reduction of social activities. Respondents who received treatment for hearing loss reported better feelings about themselves, greater independence, improved mental health, and better relationships with family. Only 22% of respondents with hearing loss received any type of treatment.\n\n【12】SIGNS OF HEARING LOSS\n---------------------\n\n【13】There are several obvious indicators of hearing loss. For example, a patient may report having to ask people to repeat themselves or turning the television volume louder than the rest of the family. A patient may also think that many people mumble or have difficulty communicating in a noisy environment. A one-on-one encounter, such as a patient-clinician conversation in a quiet room, may not be a good indicator of hearing loss because there are many redundant cues in the speech message. However, if the patient shows obvious difficulty during conversation in a quiet room, hearing loss is almost certain.\n\n【14】SCREENING FOR HEARING LOSS\n--------------------------\n\n【15】Most patients are not tested for hearing loss during a routine physical examination. Only 14% of patients reported that their primary care physician inquired about hearing.\n\n【16】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【17】MarkeTrak VI: 10-year customer satisfaction trends in the US hearing instrument market.\n\n【18】This small percentage is unfortunate because there are fast and effective ways to screen for hearing loss. The Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly,\n\n【19】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【20】The Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly: a new tool.\n\n【21】a 25-question assessment completed by the patient in the waiting room, determines a handicap score related to the level of difficulty experienced during communication. The assessment consists of statements describing how hearing loss affects the patient's life. Patients respond by answering yes, no, or sometimes. A higher score reflects greater concordance with the statements. The physician uses the score to establish a baseline for future tests. The AudioScope (Welch Allyn Medical Products, Skaneateles Falls, NY) is a hand-held instrument that randomly presents a series of 4 tones at frequencies important for understanding speech (500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, and 4000 Hz). This screening test is easily administered in less than a minute by holding the device next to the patient's ear, placing the probe in the ear canal, and presenting the tones. It can be administered by a nurse or assistant in a quiet examination room. If a patient fails to hear any of the tones in either ear, a comprehensive evaluation by an audiologist is appropriate.\n\n【22】AUDIOLOGICAL EVALUATION\n-----------------------\n\n【23】During the audiological evaluation, the audiologist assesses the patient's communication requirements and measures the degree and type of hearing loss. The threshold is determined by using a psychophysical bracketing procedure to determine the minimum intensity (loudness) heard by the patient 50% of the time. Thresholds are determined for the frequencies (pitches) most important for understanding speech. Thresholds are typically obtained for the octave frequencies from 250 Hz through 8000 Hz. Sensitivitythresholds are measured for air- and bone-conducted sounds to identify whether the hearing loss is conductive (external and/or middle ear problem) or sensorineural (inner ear and/or auditory nerve problem).\n\n【24】The audiogram in Figure 1 shows the frequency and intensity levels represented by common sounds. For a patient with normal hearing levels (HLs) at all frequencies, the sensitivity thresholds would be 20 dB HL or better. This audiogram from a patient with presbycusis depicts a sloping mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss. The patient had near-normal hearing ability for low-frequency sounds, which include many vowels and environmental sounds, but marked hearing loss for softer high-frequency sounds, including consonants, that are critical for word understanding. This patient most likely reported being able to hear people talking but could not clearly understand the words. In addition, the patient probably reported difficulty hearing amid high levels of background noise because soft consonants are easily obscured in background noise.\n\n【25】FIGURE 1 Understanding the audiogram. Frequency in cycles per second or Hertz (the physical correlate of pitch) is plotted on the abscissa, and intensity in decibels (the physical correlate of loudness) is plotted on the ordinate. Threshold results from a typical patient with mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss are depicted on the graph for the right ear (O), the left ear (X), and bone conduction (Λ). Letters within the shaded area indicate the typical frequency and intensity of that speech sound. ANSI = American National Standards Institute.\n\n【26】HEARING AID CANDIDACY\n---------------------\n\n【27】If the underlying cause of hearing difficulties is medical, the patient should be referred to an otolaryngologist. If medical intervention is unnecessary, hearing aids or other assistive listening devices can be used to improve hearing sensitivity. Any patient with documented hearing loss who reports communication difficulties is a candidate for hearing aids. Use of properly fitting hearing aids can improve speech understanding and reduces communication problems.\n\n【28】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【29】Efficacy of 3 commonly used hearing aid circuits: a crossover trial.\n\n【30】If the hearing loss is profound, hearing aids may yield negligible benefit, and a cochlear implant may be a consideration.\n\n【31】Successful use of hearing aids depends on several factors, including hearing demands, environments where problems are experienced, and motivation of the patient to adjust to using hearing aids. Approximately 30% of people with hearing aids do not wear them daily because of difficulty of use, unrealistic performance expectations, stigma associated with hearing aids, or unwillingness to be responsible for adjusting to hearing aid use.\n\n【32】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【33】MarkeTrak VI: 10-year customer satisfaction trends in the US hearing instrument market.\n\n【34】This highlights the importance of consistent follow-up care with the audiologist.\n\n【35】HEARING AID OPTIONS\n-------------------\n\n【36】Hearing aid technology has progressed rapidly in the past 10 years, and several options are currently available. The audiologist assists in making decisions regarding the use of 1 (monaural) or 2 (binaural) hearing aids, the size and style of hearing aids, internal circuitry details, and other options. Binaural hearing aids are typically recommended for bilateral hearing loss because patients hear substantially better with binaural hearing aids.\n\n【37】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【38】Binaural versus monaural hearing aid amplification for hearing impaired individuals.\n\n【39】Even if there is bilateral asymmetry in hearing, both ears should be aided when possible. One hearing aid may suffice if hearing needs are minimal or if caring for 2 hearing aids is difficult. If finances are a concern, 2 basic hearing aids may provide a better outcome than 1 sophisticated hearing aid.\n\n【40】The style of hearing aid most appropriate for a patient depends on hearing test results, ear canal size and shape, required features, and patient preference. Four basic styles of hearing aids are available. The behind-the-ear model  fits over the ear and directs sound into the ear canal through a tube and ear mold. The ear mold is a custom-fitted piece, but the behind-the-ear portion is a standard size. This style has the greatest number of circuit and feature options, and it is easy for most people to handle. The in-the-ear model  is custom-fitted to the patient. It fills the entire concha of the external ear and projects slightly into the ear canal. This style is also easy to handle and can support a large number of features. The in-the-canal model  is relatively small and protrudes slightly into the concha. This style generally uses a smaller battery, and many have fewer features. Some patients find this style difficult to handle, or their ears may be too small for the hearing aid to fit well. The smallest hearing aid is the completely-in-the-canal style . This model is contained within the ear canal and does not noticeably extend into the concha. Because of the size, handling requires good dexterity. This style uses the smallest batteries and has the fewest available features. The completely-in-the-canal style is usually recommended for patients who express concerns about the outward appearance of hearing aids and have mild to moderate hearing loss and a moderate-sized ear canal.\n\n【41】FIGURE 2 Four basic styles of hearing aids fitted to a woman's ear. Upper left, Behind-the-ear style. Upper right, In-the-ear style. Lower left, In-the-canal style. Lower right, Completely-in-the-canal style. For all hearing aids, the portion in the ear canal is custom-fitted to the patient.\n\n【42】Many models of hearing aids now incorporate digital components. Digital capability alone does not improve the quality of the hearing aid, but it supports a greater number of features and programming options. It is important to match hearing aid features with the patient's needs. For example, some models have components specifically designed for telephone use. A hearing aid should provide frequency-specific amplification across a range of input levels such that conversational speech is at a comfortable volume, while louder sounds are not heard at harsh or dangerous levels.\n\n【43】In addition to physically fitting hearing aids, audiologists program the circuit and features of each one on the basis of a patient's hearing evaluation results, ear canal acoustics, and perception of sounds. Hearing aids can be reprogrammed as needed. Depending on the hearing loss configuration, a patient may require amplification to be programmed differently in multiple frequency bands. However, typical audiometric configurations rarely require a large number of frequency bands for adjustment.\n\n【44】Recent improvements in hearing aid technology help the patient distinguish speech in background noise environments. Some models can dynamically adjust themselves to the environment, whereas others require the user to activate the processing. Nevertheless, no hearing aid can completely eliminate background noise in the environment. In fact, background noise is usually other people speaking, and hearing aids are designed to amplify voices. Innovations to dampen or reduce the perception of this noise make listening more comfortable but can also reduce speech understanding.

This is highly beneficial for patients with severe hearing loss who need a great deal of amplification. Diminutive feedback suppression circuitry allows hearing aids to fit with minimal occlusion in the ear canal and is well suited for patients with mild high-frequency hearing loss. Minimal occlusion is also beneficial for patients who prefer an “open ear” hearing aid configuration to receive both natural and amplified sounds.\n\n【51】There is no single “best device” for all patients.

As a vasoconstrictor, nicotine contributes to tissue hypoxia and adversely affects the cardiovascular system by raising blood pressure and pulse rates. Nicotine negatively impacts maternal and fetal health and has been speculated to be a carcinogen.

The central unanswered question is whether the benefit of nicotine replacement therapy to help patients quit smoking preoperatively outweighs any potential harmful impact on the overall success of the operation.\n\n【14】In their extensive and clearly presented review, Nolan and Warner\n\n【15】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【16】Safety and efficacy of nicotine replacement therapy in the perioperative period: a narrative review.\n\n【17】summarize the literature—including basic science research, results from animal experiments, and clinical data—regarding the impact of nicotine replacement therapy on operative outcomes. The major limitation of their review remains the relatively limited amount of clinical data and human studies on which to draw clear conclusions. Although the deleterious impact of smoking on nonunion of spinal fusions, failed repairs of hip fractures, and wound healing complications after reduction mammoplasty (among many other conditions) has been well characterized in humans, data related to nicotine alone has come mostly from animal models. Preclinical animal studies suggest that nicotine can impair bone healing and metabolism,\n\n【18】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【19】Influence of low-dose nicotine on bone healing.\n\n【20】decrease mechanical strength of healing fractures,\n\n【21】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【22】The effect of transdermal nicotine on fracture healing in a rabbit model.\n\n【23】adversely impact osseointegration of titanium implants,\n\n【24】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【25】The effect of systemic nicotine on osseointegration of titanium implants in the rat femur.\n\n【26】contribute to flap ischemia and necrosis,\n\n【27】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【28】Nicotine on rat TRAM flap.\n\n【29】and reduce anastomotic patency in blood vessels.\n\n【30】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【31】Acute and chronic effects of nicotine on anastomotic patency following ischemia/reperfusion.\n\n【32】Intriguingly, a contradictory study suggested that nicotine aids in wound healing.\n\n【33】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【34】Nicotine at a low concentration promotes wound healing.\n\n【35】However, many of these studies examined nicotine levels likely higher than those achieved in humans through nicotine patch, gum, or lozenge use. One option is to repeat the studies in animals with lower physiologic concentrations of nicotine. Even better would be to perform the critical human studies that could definitively characterize nicotine's effects.\n\n【36】The authors cautiously conclude that policies prohibiting the use of nicotine replacement therapy perioperatively should be reexamined. The implications of their conclusions on preoperative assessment in particular have worldwide importance because many physicians and hospital systems have not fully embraced the use of nicotine replacement therapy perioperatively. At one end of the spectrum (in support of their conclusions), there is little doubt that nicotine replacement therapy is preferable to patients actively smoking at the time of their operation. The good news from this article is that there is no clear evidence of harm from this strategy.\n\n【37】At the other end of the spectrum is the perspective that the goal should be higher—complete smoking cessation and nicotine abstinence around the time of operation. This is the perspective of plastic and orthopedic surgeons in particular, who are concerned that smoking or the use of any nicotine-releasing products, including patches, vaporizers, or gums, increases the incidence of serious complications after aesthetic, reconstructive, and orthopedic surgical procedures. For this reason, many surgeons refuse to perform elective operations in patients who are smokers or are using nicotine in any form. Some require that smoking and the use of any nicotine-releasing products be completely stopped at least several weeks before elective surgical procedures and not restarted for a week or more postoperatively. Some surgeons cancel the operation if the results of a test for urinary cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine) on the morning of the procedure are positive.\n\n【38】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【39】A plastic surgeon comments on smoking.\n\n【40】This position is supported by strong evidence from animal studies, but the lack of clinical studies might lead some to criticize this decision as anecdotally based practice and an illustration of the need for better data to guide an evidence-based approach.\n\n【41】Most readers will likely agree that nicotine replacement therapy is unlikely to affect anesthetic outcome because there are few reports of any harm in the operating room or immediate recovery in the postanesthetic care area. However, the intraoperative phase is relatively brief in comparison to the preoperative and postoperative periods, and it is unclear whether nicotine poses any longer-term surgical risks. Most readers will also agree that the existing limited data do not document a clear harmful effect of nicotine replacement therapy on surgical outcomes, but some may believe that concluding the opposite, that preoperative nicotine replacement therapy is therefore safe, might be premature. The absence of reported harm in limited studies is not convincing proof of safety, and this issue requires further research.\n\n【42】Ideally, the primary role of nicotine replacement therapy in the hospital setting would be to help smokers who have already undergone emergency surgical procedures control their postoperative cravings for cigarettes and to serve as the bridge to lifelong cessation. Hopefully, the recently completed operation will prove to be the final procedure in the patient's lifetime. However, although nicotine replacement therapy is welcome in active smokers hospitalized immediately after emergent procedures, it would be preferable if nicotine replacement therapy has only a temporary role in a larger effort to achieve complete tobacco abstinence.\n\n【43】The elective setting is more complex, and a key principle should be to capitalize on the teachable moment of elective surgical intervention to transition the patient to full tobacco and nicotine abstinence. The difference compared with emergency operations is that there is time to prepare the patient in an outpatient setting through a combination of counseling, quitlines, and medications to help them quit. Existing policy in England requires that patients scheduled for elective surgical procedures undergo smoking cessation counseling for several weeks preoperatively.\n\n【44】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【45】Helping smokers quit around the time of surgery.\n\n【46】Naturally, the ideal is for patients to taper off both smoking and nicotine replacement therapy in the days leading up to the operation and not resume use postoperatively.\n\n【47】Additional studies to characterize the therapeutic nicotine dose response and to convincingly document that nicotine replacement therapy does not affect wound healing, bone fracture healing, or anastomoses would be ideal. Research has revealed that the incidence of wound healing complications in smokers is dose dependent, with higher preoperative cotinine levels linked to a greater risk of healing delay.\n\n【48】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【49】The evils of nicotine: an evidence-based guide to smoking and plastic surgery.\n\n【50】Until these nicotine replacement studies are completed, one alternative is to prescribe nonnicotine therapies such as varenicline or bupropion to aid perioperative smoking cessation. The contraindications should be noted, and the adverse effects and efficacy of these medications in this setting should also be studied. Others might question whether to use electronic cigarettes without nicotine (placebo), which have been found to be almost 60% as effective as electronic cigarettes containing nicotine in promoting cessation.\n\n【51】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【52】Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation: a randomised controlled trial.\n\n【53】However, this approach would not work everywhere, including England, where the use of electronic cigarettes perioperatively for smoking cessation has been discouraged.\n\n【54】Another current challenge is to develop a new assay to distinguish a patient who is actively smoking from one who is using nicotine replacement therapy; in both groups, urinary cotinine levels will be elevated. New tests for anabasine or other metabolites specific to the nicotine from cigarettes will help prevent cancellation of an operation on the day of the procedure for a patient who is compliant with nicotine replacement therapy and has stopped smoking,\n\n【55】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【56】Anabasine and anatabine as biomarkers for tobacco use during nicotine replacement therapy.\n\n【57】as opposed to someone who is still smoking and not being honest about his or her tobacco use.\n\n【58】In the final analysis, the goal is to help our patients stop smoking and to utilize the teachable moment of elective surgical procedures as an opportunity to break the addiction to nicotine and achieve permanent smoking cessation. A new diagnosis of myocardial infarction or lung cancer requiring surgical intervention can be one of the most powerful motivators for a patient to finally quit smoking. Some will question whether allowing nicotine replacement therapy delivers a mixed message to patients that indirectly condones both nicotine addiction and continued smoking. Nicotine replacement therapy should not serve as a bridge to relapse after operation or promote lifelong addiction to nicotine.\n\n【59】Where Nolan and Warner's review succeeds the most is with suggestions of where new research might be directed. The authors note that no animal studies have examined how nicotine may affect surgical site infections, and virtually no human studies have directly examined the impact of nicotine replacement therapy on bone healing, perioperative cardiovascular risk, or plastic surgery wound outcomes. Young surgical researchers in particular could dedicate their careers to answering these questions and to strengthening smoking cessation efforts around the time of surgical treatment.

More specifically, would it lead to reclassification of patients from one risk group to another (for example, from “low risk” or “intermediate risk” to “high risk”) with resultant changes in management?\n\n【4】For patients at high risk of stroke who are already being treated with maximal primary prevention techniques, measurement of Lp-PLA <sub>2 </sub> is unlikely to result in changes in management. For example, if a patient's risk of stroke is 20%, an elevated Lp-PLA <sub>2 </sub> (OR, 1.91) results in a revised stroke risk of 28%. Physicians are likely to treat both levels of risk in the same way, making the utility of Lp-PLA <sub>2 </sub> measurement questionable. For patients at low or intermediate risk of stroke who are not receiving maximal therapy, an elevated Lp-PLA <sub>2 </sub> measurement may prompt more aggressive risk reduction, although in our experience, ORs in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 rarely result in changes in management. That being said, reducing stroke risk often hinges on motivating patients to be compliant with interventions and lifestyle changes. If a clinician believes that additional evidence of an increased stroke risk, as provided by an elevated Lp-PLA <sub>2 </sub> level, would motivate a patient to be more compliant with risk reduction interventions, then it should certainly be used. The same point applies to the use of Lp-PLA <sub>2 </sub> for risk stratification of patients for CVD.\n\n【5】Dr Myerson believes that comparing Lp-PLA <sub>2 </sub> to C-reactive protein may be inappropriate because Lp-PLA <sub>2 </sub> is more specific for CVD. Although physiologic theory supports this view, the evidence indicates that in clinical practice, the contribution of C-reactive protein (OR, 1.58) and Lp-PLA <sub>2 </sub> (OR, 1.60) to risk stratification for CVD is similar.\n\n【6】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【7】C-reactive protein and other circulating markers of inflammation in the prediction of coronary heart disease.\n\n【8】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【9】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【10】Narrative review: assessment of C-reactive protein in risk prediction for cardiovascular disease.\n\n【11】Finally, we concur with Dr Myerson that cardiovascular risk stratification is a “very good, but imperfect, science.” The Framingham Risk Score remains a useful way to estimate the risk of CVD that works well for most patients, and routine measurement of Lp-PLA <sub>2 </sub> and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein for this purpose is not recommended. However, at its best, risk stratification (and evidence-based medicine) is a highly individualized exercise that combines data from population-based studies with the physician's clinical judgment and the individual circumstances of the patient.

Verner-Morrison syndrome has not been described as a paraneoplastic syndrome in non–small cell lung cancer. We describe a 38-year-old man with metastatic non–small cell lung cancer of large cell carcinoma with neuroendocrine differentiation who presented with bone metastasis and intractable secretory diarrhea that was unresponsive to pharmacological treatment, including octreotide. Laboratory evaluation indicated elevated serum calcitonin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide levels.

Typically, it is mediated by a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway best described in _Vibrio cholerae_ enterotoxin. This leads to increased secretion of intracellular chloride and bicarbonate and decreased absorption of intraluminal sodium. Patients with enterotoxin-mediated diarrhea present with severe hypokalemia secondary to potassium loss in the stool and dehydration due to concomitant free water loss.\n\n【6】Evaluating a patient who presents with chronic secretory diarrhea can be complicated. Patients may present with large volumes of watery diarrhea refractory to traditional antidiarrheals such as atropine or loperamide. Patients often undergo a gastrointestinal evaluation, including multiple stool studies for infection, laxative abuse, protein-losing enteropathy, and inflammatory bowel disease. Also, patients often undergo upper and lower endoscopies to exclude underlying colitis, celiac sprue, vasculitis, intestinal lymphangiectasia, and lymphoma. In most cases, these investigations are sufficient for finding the etiology of the diarrhea. However, if no source is found, an endocrine cause must be considered for this extremely debilitating problem.\n\n【7】In secretory diarrhea induced by paracrine hormones such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), calcitonin, and gastrin, the stimulus for chloride secretion is via the same cAMP mechanism as _Vibrio_ toxin.

Subsequently, the patient required narcotic analgesics for relief of pain and developed a right foot drop. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine revealed a compression fracture of the T7 vertebra with impingement on the adjacent spinal cord. The patient was given intravenous (IV) corticosteroids for spinal cord compression and underwent vertebrectomy of the T7 vertebra 2 days later. The pathology of the vertebral specimen was reported as a malignant neoplasm not further classifiable due to widespread necrosis, and ancillary studies with an extensive panel of immunohistochemical stains were noncontributory. The patient was noted to have a normal complete blood cell count and electrolyte panel; also, computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were normal. Subsequent laboratory test results included normal serum protein electrophoresis, an elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of 39.5 ng/mL (upper limit of normal \\[ULN\\], 3.0 ng/mL), and normal levels of alpha fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin. The patient was otherwise asymptomatic and was observed for 2 weeks.\n\n【47】Five weeks after surgery, the patient developed profuse watery diarrhea, initially believed to be related to postoperative antibiotics. However, no stool analyses were performed at that time. Approximately 6 to 7 weeks after the patient's spinal surgery, he presented to the Mayo Clinic for evaluation of malignancy of unknown origin, persistent back pain, and uncontrollable diarrhea. Initial blood test results revealed the following (reference ranges shown parenthetically): sodium, 137 mEq/L (135-145 mEq/L); potassium, 2.8 mEq/L (3.6-4.8 mEq/L); calcium, 14.4 mg/ dL (8.9-10.1 mg/dL); CEA, 161.0 ng/mL (≤3.0 ng/mL); alkaline phosphatase, 440 U/L (98-251 U/L); prostate-specific antigen, 5.0 ng/mL (<2.0 ng/mL); lactate dehydrogenase, 304 U/L (91-198 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 57 U/L (12-31 U/L); and bicarbonate, 20 mEq/L (22-29 mEq/L). Test results for magnesium, glucose, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, creatinine, and serum urea nitrogen were normal.\n\n【48】The patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment of hypercalcemia and dehydration. On admission, the patient's physical examination revealed a moderately wasted man. No skin changes were noted. Examination of his chest, heart, and extremities revealed only tachycardia. The patient had no palpable lymph nodes or thyroid nodules. Abdominal examination was notable for hyperactive bowel sounds, mild distention, no organomegaly, and mild tenderness of the left lower quadrant. Chest radiographic findings were normal except for postoperative changes of the vertebrectomy . The patient was treated with fluid hydration and 4 mg of IV zoledronic acid for hypercalcemia of malignancy. The hypercalcemia improved within 3 days of treatment. With hydration, the patient's potassium level decreased to 2.1 mEq/L on day 5 of hospitalization. Continuous IV infusion of potassium chloride at 10 mEq/h and oral potassium chloride at 40 mEq every 8 hours did not improve his hypokalemia. His diarrhea worsened to approximately 5 L of stool per day. The patient's stool osmolality was 299 mOsm/kg (220-280 mOsm/kg). Stool electrolytes were as follows: sodium, 7 mEq/kg (ULN, 160 mEq/kg); potassium, 157 mEq/kg (ULN, 200 mEq/kg); chloride, 42 mEq/kg (ULN, 40 mEq/kg); magnesium, 2 mEq/kg (ULN, 200 mEq/kg). The patient's stool osmotic gap was calculated at –38 mOsm/kg, consistent with a secretory diarrhea. Bacterial cultures (number of cultures in brackets) were negative (including _Aeromonas_ \\[2\\], _Clostridium difficile_ toxin screens \\[6\\], ova and parasite screens \\[2\\], _Giardia_ antigen \\[2\\], and _Cryptosporidia, Isospora,_ and _Microsporidia_ \\[1 each\\]). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with small bowel biopsies revealed normal mucosa with no evidence of Whipple disease, celiac sprue, or _Giardia_ . Colonoscopy showed normal colonic mucosa with no evidence of microscopic colitis or inflammatory bowel disease. The patient was given a maximal dose of loperamide and atropine/diphenoxylate without improvement in symptoms. Subcutaneous octreotide, up to 300 µg 4 times a day, was added with no quantitative or symptomatic relief in high-volume diarrhea. Also, tincture of opium was added without success.\n\n【49】Figure 1 Chest x-ray film on admission shows normal findings except for postoperative changes of the vertebrectomy.\n\n【50】On hospital day 2, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was repeated to look for the primary source of malignancy. Computed tomography  revealed diffuse small lytic lesions throughout the visualized skeleton, the largest of which was 5 mm. Moderate lymphadenopathy was noted in the right paratracheal space with 2 noncalcified indeterminate nodules in the apex of the right lung, the largest being 1 cm. Multiple small metastatic lesions were present throughout the liver and kidneys, the largest being 6 mm. Mediastinoscopy with lymph node biopsy was performed. The histological features were those of a large cell carcinoma of lung origin, confirmed by positive immunoreactivity for keratin, CAM 5.2, and thyroid transcription factor 1 tumor markers . Neuroendocrine differentiation was confirmed at an immunohistochemical level with positive immunoreactivity for chromogranin ; however, the neoplastic cells were negative for calcitonin and VIP.\n\n【51】Figure 2 Chest computed tomogram shows nodules in 2 slices of the right upper lung.\n\n【52】Figure 3 Left, Intermediate-power photomicrograph of malignant neoplasm within paratracheal lymph node shows lack of glandular or squamous differentiation. The cells are large and pleomorphic with areas of necrosis (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×100). Right, Neoplastic cells, diffusely positive for chromogranin, show neuroendocrine differentiation by immunohistochemistry (chromogranin, original magnification ×100).\n\n【53】The patient's serum was screened for paraneoplastic causes of diarrhea. His VIP level was elevated at 2200 pg/mL (ULN, 75 pg/mL); calcitonin level was elevated at 9571 pg/mL (ULN, 15.9 pg/mL); corticotropin level was elevated slightly at 82 pg/mL (ULN, 60 pg/mL); and gastrin level was normal. The patient's thyrotropin level was depressed at 0.26 mIU/L (lower limit of normal, 0.30 mIU/L), but both total and free triiodothyronine levels were within normal limits. The parathyroid hormone (PTH)– related peptide level was normal, and the PTH level was elevated at 24 pmol/L (ULN, 5.2 pmol/L).\n\n【54】The patient was given etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy for NSCLC. The patient responded clinically within 2 days of treatment with substantial improvement in stool volume of less than 1 L per day. Next, parenteral potassium chloride was gradually decreased and discontinued. The patient's potassium level stabilized at 3.8 mEq/L. Serum markers for disease improved with treatment . Four days after treatment, the patient's calcitonin level decreased from 9571 to 3738 pg/mL, and his VIP level decreased from 2200 pg/mL to 428 pg/mL. However, his CEA level increased from 161 ng/mL to 299 ng/mL.\n\n【55】Figure 4 Endocrine tumor markers. Initiation of chemotherapy was on hospital day 11. We observed a substantial decline in tumor marker levels within 3 days. VIP = vasoactive intestinal polypeptide.\n\n【56】The patient's improvement was transient. He returned home, but within 2 weeks of treatment, his diarrhea and associated hypokalemia returned. A repeated calcitonin test revealed that the level had increased to 10,000 pg/mL or higher. The patient received a repeated course of etoposide and cisplatin, which improved both his diarrhea and potassium level for 1 week. Repeated CT of the abdomen showed enlarging liver metastases. Chemotherapy was changed to docetaxel and carboplatin without benefit. Shortly thereafter, the patient developed _Candida_ sepsis and died.\n\n【57】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【58】To our knowledge, this is the first published case of a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by secretory diarrhea due to the secretion of multiple active hormones, VIP and calcitonin, by metastatic pulmonary LCCND. Endocrine paraneoplastic syndromes occur in approximately 20% of patients with lung cancer but are associated much more commonly with small cell lung cancer and carcinoid tumors because of their neuroendocrine differentiation, which is characterized ultrastructurally by the presence of neuroendocrine granules and by immunoreactivity with different neuroendocrine markers, including chromogranin and synaptophysin. However, up to 20% of NSCLC, including adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, can display similar neuroendocrine differentiation and thus may explain the occurrence of endocrine syndromes with these subtypes, as seen in our patient.\n\n【59】A common neuroendocrine syndrome described with NSCLC is hypercalcemia of malignancy, secondary to osteolytic bone metastases and ectopic production of PTH or PTH-related peptide. Multiple other neuroendocrine syndromes have been described. Most are case reports, with large cell carcinoma described in association with ectopic secretion of chorionic gonadotropin, growth hormone, glucagon, and gastrin, but not with VIP. Although secretion of calcitonin has been described in NSCLC including large cell carcinoma, it usually has not been associated with any clinical manifestation.\n\n【60】Seven described neuroendocrine tumors can cause diarrhea: gastrinomas (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome), VIPomas (Verner-Morrison syndrome), glucagonomas, somatostatinomas, pancreatic endocrine tumors secreting calcitonin, medullary thyroid cancer, and carcinoid syndrome.\n\n【61】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【62】Overview of chronic diarrhea caused by functional neuroendocrine neoplasms.\n\n【63】These constitute a rare form of chronic diarrhea but should be considered when all other causes have been ruled out. Helpful features in identifying a paraneoplastic endocrine syndrome as the cause of chronic diarrhea include identification of a malignancy and the development of hypokalemia and hypercalcemia in association with fasting hyperglycemia. Verner-Morrison syndrome is most commonly caused by islet cell tumors of the pancreas secreting VIP, but calcitonin has been noted as a possible cause in some patients.\n\n【64】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【65】Hypersecretion of calcitonin in patients with the Verner-Morrison syndrome.\n\n【66】Interestingly, immunohistochemical studies of our patient's tumor revealed no calcitonin or VIP in the tumor. This suggests rapid release of synthesized hormone, reaching high levels in the blood and low to absent levels in tumor cells, similar to pancreatic epithelial VIPoma.\n\n【67】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【68】The morphology and neuroendocrine profile of pancreatic epithelial VIPomas and extrapancreatic, VIP-producing, neurogenic tumors.\n\n【69】Alternatively, the tumor conceivably produced another as-yet unidentified substance that stimulated abnormal production of VIP and calcitonin by normal tissues.

The use of chemotherapy when the primary source of the malignancy was unclear and the tumor type was poorly defined was complicated by the concern that many chemotherapies are associated with diarrhea as a common adverse effect. Nevertheless, when the paraneoplastic mechanism for the secretory diarrhea was determined, it required specific treatment of the tumor to control the symptoms because all other supportive measures had failed. Although the benefit of chemotherapy was shortlived, it allowed the patient to return home to spend valuable time with his family.

For the in-hospital and 30-day mortality, respectively, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.92 and 0.88 for the NYSRS and 0.93 and 0.90 for the MCRS, indicating excellent discrimination. The NYSRS model underpredicted event rates when applied in Mayo Clinic data (2.6% observed \\[127 of 4898 patients\\] vs 2.3% predicted \\[114 of 4898 patients\\]), even after recalibration. The instantaneous hazard over time revealed the highest risk of death in the first 3 days after PCI (daily probability, >0.2%), declined to 0.1% until about day 12, and then decreased below 0.1%. Cardiac causes (mainly myocardial infarction) dominated in the first week (83 of 85 deaths \\[97.6%\\]) and then decreased to 59.5% (25 of 42 deaths) between 8 and 30 days after PCI.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The discriminatory ability of the NYSRS and the MCRS for in-hospital and 30-day mortality after PCI is roughly interchangeable.

Vail introduced the concept of using a peer-review system to evaluate the education, training, and qualifications of medical specialists and advocated for the development of a specialty board that would oversee this process. His foresight served as the springboard for the genesis of the specialty board movement in the United States and led to the establishment of the American Board for Ophthalmic Examinations, now the American Board of Ophthalmology,\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】History of the American Board of Ophthalmology.\n\n【3】in 1916.\n\n【4】The subsequent founding of the American Board of Otolaryngology (1924), American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (1930), and American Board of Dermatology (1932) led to the establishment of an umbrella organization, the Advisory Board for Medical Specialties, in 1933 to facilitate the common purposes and activities of these fledgling boards; in 1970 it was reorganized as the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS).\n\n【5】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【6】*   American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS)\n\n【7】ABMS Maintenance of Certification: Ten Years Strong and Growing. 2010 ABMS Certificate Statistics.\n\n【8】ABMS , Chicago, IL 2010\n\n【9】The stated mission of the ABMS, now composed of a total of 24 member boards, is to maintain and improve the quality of medical care in the United States, and it does this by assisting its member boards in their efforts to develop professional and educational standards for the evaluation and certification of physician specialists. These boards issue certificates for more than 150 primary specialties and subspecialties.\n\n【10】The intent of these certificates is to assure the public that a board-certified physician has successfully completed an approved educational program and evaluation process that has assessed the knowledge, skills, and experience required to provide high-quality care in a given specialty or subspecialty. Certificates are initially issued after physicians successfully complete accredited training, pass a secure written examination, and, for some member boards, pass an oral examination. For the first 36 years of existence of the ABMS, these certificates were issued for life. However, when the American Board of Family Medicine was founded in 1969, it did so with the intent of only issuing time-limited certificates that would require renewal every 7 years.\n\n【11】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【12】Family medicine at forty years of age: the journey to transformation continues.\n\n【13】Thereafter, growing awareness within the ABMS that one-time certification was not sufficient to guarantee to the public that physicians could continue to deliver high-quality care throughout their careers led to an increasing number of member boards embracing the concept of recertification. However, although the American Board of Surgery and American Board of Thoracic Surgery followed suit with the issuance of time-limited certificates in 1976, it took an additional 30 years before this concept was fully embraced by the ABMS when the final remaining member board began issuing time-limited certificates in 2006.\n\n【14】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【15】*   American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS)\n\n【16】ABMS Maintenance of Certification: Ten Years Strong and Growing. 2010 ABMS Certificate Statistics.\n\n【17】ABMS , Chicago, IL 2010\n\n【18】Spurred by the reluctance of many member boards to fully come to terms with the compelling arguments in favor of recertification, ABMS leadership moved forward with the establishment of the Task Force on Competence in 1998 to ensure that specialists maintained up-to-date knowledge and skills throughout their careers. The work of this task force led to the commitment to evolve existing certification programs into a new paradigm called Maintenance of Certification (MOC). This new process would be built on the definition of a competent physician that encompassed all of the important domains of professional medical practice and the 6 general competencies jointly developed and agreed upon by the ABMS and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education—professionalism, medical knowledge, patient care, interpersonal and communications skills, systems-based practice, and practice-based learning and improvement. These competencies would be assessed within the framework of 4 distinct parts of MOC: professional standing, commitment to lifelong learning and periodic self-assessment, cognitive expertise, and performance in practice.\n\n【19】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【20】American Board of Medical Specialties and repositioning for excellence in lifelong learning: maintenance of certification.\n\n【21】This new certification program was approved by the ABMS and its member boards in March 2000, and by 2006 all member boards had received approval for their individual MOC programs.\n\n【22】Although the ABMS was developing the framework for MOC, much was happening within the health care environment. Charged with developing strategies for improving the quality of health care in the United States, the Committee on the Quality of Health Care in America was formed in 1998 by the Institute of Medicine, now the National Academy of Medicine. The Committee published 2 landmark consensus reports. The first, _To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System_ published in 1999,\n\n【23】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【24】*   Institute of Medicine\n\n【25】To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System.\n\n【26】The National Academies Pr , Washington, DC 2000\n\n【27】warned that tens of thousands of Americans died each year as a result of errors in their care that a truly high-quality health care system would prevent. The second, _Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century_ published 2 years later,\n\n【28】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【29】*   Institute of Medicine\n\n【30】Crossing the Quality Chasm: A New Health System for the 21st Century.\n\n【31】The National Academies Pr , Washington, DC 2001\n\n【32】reported that our health care system frequently fell short in its ability to translate knowledge into practice and that a fragmented delivery system resulted in poorly designed care and duplication of services; it concluded that the absence of progress toward addressing quality and cost was distressing. The ongoing work of Fisher and Wennberg\n\n【33】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【34】Health care quality, geographic variations, and the challenge of supply-sensitive care.\n\n【35】with the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care underscored the issues raised in these reports with convincing evidence of significant variation in health care quality and cost throughout the country.\n\n【36】It would have seemed that the decision by the ABMS member boards to implement their MOC programs at the beginning of the 21st century was propitious. The aims of the program seemed perfectly designed to address these critical issues. Unfortunately, the subsequent implementation of MOC did not match the careful thought and sound rationale that went into conceptualizing it. Controversy swirled around the introduction of this new certification paradigm with considerable resistance from multiple quarters, but most prominently from the Internal Medicine community.\n\n【37】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【38】Boarded to death—why maintenance of certification is bad for doctors and patients.\n\n【39】Why does so much resistance to MOC exist? An article in this issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ provides some clues to the answer.\n\n【40】Cook et al\n\n【41】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【42】Physician attitudes about maintenance of certification: a cross-specialty national survey.\n\n【43】conducted a national survey by randomly sampling physicians across multiple specialties and querying them about their attitudes toward MOC. The survey instrument included 13 questions about MOC, 2 burnout items, and demographic questions. Overall, 81% of physicians believed that MOC was a burden, only 24% agreed that MOC activities were relevant to their patients, and only 15% felt that MOC was worth the effort. Although attitudes varied significantly across specialties, low perceived value and relevance was seen across almost all the specialties. Although 38% of the respondents met the criteria for being burned out, no association between attitudes toward MOC and burnout was found.\n\n【44】The authors are to be applauded for the rigor of their study design and methodological approach, the meticulous design of their survey instrument, and the robust analysis of their data. Nevertheless, several methodological issues, most acknowledged within the article and not unusual for survey research, may limit our ability to accurately interpret the conclusions. First, the 21.6% response rate raises the potential issue of sampling bias. Second, we do not know how many respondents had actually completed any elements of MOC; given that almost 30% of the respondents held lifetime certificates, the number that may not have participated may have been substantial. Finally, physician responses may have reflected misconceptions about MOC not based in fact.\n\n【45】Even with these limitations, if the ABMS member board community disregards the results of this study, it does so at its own peril. The data suggest that displeasure with MOC is prevalent and that no single member board appears to be immune. Although the reasons for this discontent are multifactorial and beyond the scope of this editorial to enumerate, one very important piece of data from this study is illuminating; namely, 88% of respondents felt that MOC activities were not well integrated into their daily routine.\n\n【46】Physicians today are overburdened coping with the vagaries of their electronic health records, endless reporting requirements, and the demands of multiple payors. The amount of time that they are spending with patients continues to dwindle, and the last thing that they want to do is spend additional time, meeting yet another set of requirements that they find burdensome. It is imperative that ABMS member boards take these issues into account and redesign their MOC programs to become more efficient, meaningful, and impactful.\n\n【47】Greater effort needs to be placed on critically assessing whether MOC components are helping physicians deliver better care and are therefore perceived as being valuable. Many member boards have begun the important task of doing so,\n\n【48】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【49】Physician satisfaction with and practice changes resulting from American Board of Family Medicine maintenance of certification performance in practice modules.\n\n【50】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【51】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【52】Family physicians' quality interventions and performance improvement through the ABFM diabetes performance in practice module.\n\n【53】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【54】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【55】Practice improvements based on participation in simulation for the maintenance of certification in anesthesiology program.\n\n【56】but until this becomes a systematic design feature of MOC programs, member boards will continue to flounder, not knowing whether the assessment tools that they are developing are effective or not. This will only lead to continuing frustration and discontent.\n\n【57】Other than the publication of the Flexner Report in 1910, perhaps no singular event was more important in firmly establishing American medicine as a profession than the establishment of the American Board of Ophthalmology in 1916.

Fabry disease–specific therapy necessitates early diagnosis; however, the optimal screening strategy and cost efficacy of routine α-galactosidase A (α-gal A) vs comprehensive galactosidase alpha gene ( _GLA_ ) testing remain poorly understood. We identified 1192 patients who underwent routine α-gal A screening between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2017, for suspected HCM. Cost efficacy was explored using prevalence and cost estimates. Ten patients had reduced α-gal A enzyme activity, and 5 (3 women) were ultimately diagnosed with FD (prevalence estimate, 0.42%). An alternative cardiac diagnosis was made in 3 patients with mildly reduced enzyme activity. Two women with reduced borderline enzyme levels did not undergo confirmatory testing, but FD was not suspected. The number needed to screen to diagnose 1 patient with FD in a similar cohort is estimated at 238 (5 new cases per 1192 at-risk individuals) at a cost of approximately US $24,000 per diagnosis. We identified a 0.42% prevalence of FD using routine α-gal A screening in adult patients referred to a dedicated HCM center in the United States.

He described his dyspnea as a feeling of “breathing through a straw.” Additional symptoms included a weight gain of 5 kg in the prior 3 weeks, increased abdominal girth, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He also noticed a decline in exercise tolerance from a prior ability to ascend 9 flights of stairs to tolerating only a few steps. He denied fevers, chills, night sweats, palpitations, lightheadedness, or dizziness. He had no recent upper respiratory illness symptoms, such as nasal congestion, sore throat, cough, or sinus pain. His medical history was notable for a small, congenital ventricular septal defect (VSD), obesity (body mass index, 35 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) and seasonal allergies. His only medication included fexofenadine. He never used tobacco products and reported an average alcohol intake of 2 to 3 beverages per week. In terms of family history, he has a brother with a history of atrial fibrillation; otherwise, there was no family medical history of heart failure or premature coronary artery disease. On physical examination, he was tachycardic with a heart rate of 148 beats per minute with an irregularly irregular rhythm, bibasilar crackles, abdominal distention, jugular venous distension, hepatojugular reflux, and 1+, symmetric, bilateral lower extremity pitting edema.\n\n【1】*   1.\n\n【2】    **Which _one_ of the following diagnoses is _most_ consistent with the patient’s clinical picture?**\n\n【3】    *   a.\n\n【4】        Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n\n【5】    *   b.\n\n【6】        Congestive heart failure (CHF)\n\n【7】    *   c.\n\n【8】        Pulmonary embolus\n\n【9】    *   d.\n\n【10】        Acute coronary syndrome\n\n【11】    *   e.\n\n【12】        Constrictive pericarditis\n\n【13】The clinical findings are not suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is no history of smoking and no wheezing on physical examination. His symptoms are consistent with a classic presentation of CHF. Patients with volume overload secondary to CHF often demonstrate dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. He also has physical examination findings of bibasilar crackles, pitting edema, and abdominal distension. The progressive nature of dyspnea is less consistent with pulmonary embolus or an acute coronary syndrome. Although constrictive pericarditis can manifest with jugular venous distension and chest discomfort in the flat position, he does not have pleuritic chest pain, fever, or a friction rub on physical examination.\n\n【14】His laboratory studies were the following: hemoglobin, 16.0 g/dL; sodium, 143 mmol/L; creatinine, 1.2 mg/dL; low density lipoprotein, 77 U/L; high density lipoprotein, 54 mg/dL, triglycerides, 88 mg/dL; total cholesterol, 137 mg/dL; thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 2.0 mlU/L. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (RVR) at rate of 148 beats per minute (bpm) without ST-T segment changes suggestive of ischemia. Chest radiography demonstrated new mild cardiomegaly.\n\n【15】*   2.\n\n【16】    **What is the next _most appropriate_ test for evaluation of his clinical presentation?**\n\n【17】    *   a.\n\n【18】        Right heart catheterization\n\n【19】    *   b.\n\n【20】        Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE)\n\n【21】    *   c.\n\n【22】        Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【23】    *   d.\n\n【24】        Endomyocardial biopsy\n\n【25】    *   e.\n\n【26】        Coronary angiogram\n\n【27】Right heart catheterization would provide additional hemodynamic information including cardiac output, filling pressures, and central venous pressure; however, it is not routinely indicated in new diagnosis of heart failure. A TTE is a first-line diagnostic test in new cases of heart failure to assess for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and structural changes, such as wall motion abnormalities or ventricular dilatation or hypertrophy. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can be used to evaluate assess wall motion abnormalities, function, and myocardial tissue perfusion, injury, infiltration, fibrosis, and viability, but is not an appropriate initial test. Endomyocardial biopsies are reserved for patients with progressively worsening heart failure despite appropriate medical therapy, for whom amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, or giant-cell myocarditis is suspected. Coronary angiogram can be considered in new diagnoses of heart failure to determine whether there is an ischemic etiology or reversible ischemia, especially in patients with risk factors. However, angiography would not be the first diagnostic test.\n\n【28】His TTE showed an LVEF of 25% with severe generalized left ventricular hypokinesis, moderate right ventricular enlargement with moderate reduction in right ventricular systolic function, right ventricular systolic pressure of 56 mm Hg, severe left atrial enlargement, and mitral and tricuspid annulus dilatation with secondary functional severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. There was no change in his congenital VSD. At the time of the study, he was notably tachycardic (132 bpm). An ECG 1 year ago showed an LVEF of 60%, no regional wall motion abnormalities, normal right ventricular size and systolic function, small membranous VSD with restrictive left-to-right shunt, mild tricuspid regurgitation, mild mitral regurgitation, trivial aortic stenosis, and trivial aortic regurgitation.\n\n【29】His clinical symptomatology of CHF and LVEF less than 50% classifies the diagnosis of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).\n\n【30】Along with a TTE, initial diagnostic evaluation for acute CHF presentations should include a 12-lead ECG to evaluate for acute myocardial infarction, tachyarrhythmia, conduction abnormalities, or left ventricular hypertrophy. A chest radiography should be obtained to evaluate for an acute cardiopulmonary process such as pneumonia, pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax. Other initial laboratory studies should include a complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential, electrolyte levels, creatinine, N-terminal-pro b-type natriuretic peptide, troponin level, urinalysis, lipid panel and TSH. Coronary artery disease causes approximately two thirds of CHF, and an acute coronary syndrome should be suggested as a cause of new-onset heart failure if there are elevated troponin levels, new ECG abnormalities, an acute onset of symptoms, or concurrent signs and symptoms of systemic hypoperfusion.\n\n【31】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【32】Risk factors for congestive heart failure in US men and women: NHANES I epidemiologic follow-up study.\n\n【33】Hyponatremia, if present, is a poor prognostic factor.\n\n【34】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【35】OPTIME-CHF Investigators  \nLower serum sodium is associated with increased short-term mortality in hospitalized patients with worsening heart failure: results from the Outcomes of a Prospective Trial of Intravenous Milrinone for Exacerbations of Chronic Heart Failure (OPTIME-CHF) study.\n\n【36】The patient also had an ECG Holter monitor revealing of atrial fibrillation with heart rates varying from 93-179 bpm (average, 126 bpm) with RVR occurring 99.9% of the time captured. He reported dyspnea while in atrial fibrillation with RVR. He was given furosemide and metoprolol tartrate by his primary care physician with plans to titrate to heart rates slower than 110 bpm.\n\n【37】*   3.\n\n【38】    **What is the next _most appropriate_ step for optimizing this patient’s medical treatment of HFrEF?**\n\n【39】    *   a.\n\n【40】        Switch metoprolol tartrate to atenolol\n\n【41】    *   b.\n\n【42】        Stop furosemide and start hydrochlorothiazide\n\n【43】    *   c.\n\n【44】        Refer for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement\n\n【45】    *   d.\n\n【46】        Refer to cardiothoracic surgery for mitral valve replacement\n\n【47】    *   e.\n\n【48】        Start anticoagulation\n\n【49】Three beta blockers with beta-1 activity have been shown to decrease mortality in heart failure: carvedilol, bisoprolol, and metoprolol succinate. A switch to atenolol would not be appropriate. There is some debate as to whether carvedilol is superior to metoprolol in mortality reduction, as shown by the COMET trial in 2003.\n\n【50】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【51】Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial Investigators. Comparison of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure in the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial (COMET): randomised controlled trial.\n\n【52】In this study, carvedilol had better reduction in mortality rate compared with metoprolol tartrate. Carvedilol has alpha blockade properties that is speculated to be beneficial by facilitating vasodilation, glucose uptake, and insulin sensitivity.\n\n【53】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【54】Carvedilol in the treatment of chronic heart failure: lessons from the Carvedilol Or Metoprolol European Trial.\n\n【55】Of note, because the COMET trial used the tartrate formulation instead of the extended-release succinate form, a definite superiority between metoprolol succinate and carvedilol cannot be determined. Beta blocker dose response relationship to reduction in mortality has been shown; patients should be uptitrated on beta blockers as tolerated in HFrEF and until rate control is achieved in atrial fibrillation. Furosemide is a more appropriate diuretic than hydrochlorothiazide. Dosing should be based on volume status; however, there is no dose-dependent relationship to mortality outcomes. ICD placement consideration is indicated for primary prophylaxis against sudden cardiac death in patients with New York Heart Association Class II or III HFrEF with LVEF less than 35% after 3 months of optimal medical management. However, patients should be on optimal medical treatment and treated for reversible underlying etiologies before ICD implantation consideration. Similarly, mitral valve replacement is not indicated at this time, as his severe mitral regurgitation is functional and could improve with treatment of reversible causes.

He transitioned to carvedilol for beta blockade, started taking lisinopril, and continued with furosemide as directed by his cardiologist.\n\n【59】His HFrEF was thought to be most likely due to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Initial clues were new reduced LVEF with generalized hypokinesis in the setting of a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation with predominant RVR on ECG Holter monitoring.\n\n【60】On a return visit to his primary care physician, the patient had persistently elevated heart rates to the 130-bpm range despite being uptitrated on carvedilol therapy. His in-clinic blood pressure was 104/81 mm Hg.\n\n【61】*   4.\n\n【62】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ next step in the management of this patient?**\n\n【63】    *   a.\n\n【64】        Further increase beta blocker dosage\n\n【65】    *   b.\n\n【66】        Refer for prompt direct electrical cardioversion\n\n【67】    *   c.\n\n【68】        Refer for pacemaker placement\n\n【69】    *   d.\n\n【70】        Refer for ICD placement\n\n【71】    *   e.\n\n【72】        Prescribe aspirin and clopidogrel\n\n【73】Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy results from prolonged elevated heart rate, which is often reversible upon control of the arrhythmia or heart rate. The goal of initial therapy is to achieve rate control. Increasing beta blockade would be an option for achieving rate control in this patient. However, rate control may be difficult to achieve with beta blockade in patients with rapid ventricular rates and new reduction of ejection fraction (EF)—as in this case.

The TEE also showed severe left atrial enlargement, along with previously seen severe mitral regurgitation and severe tricuspid regurgitation. An ECG after cardioversion showed sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 94 bpm with premature atrial complexes.\n\n【78】Although direct electric cardioversion is an effective way to revert to sinus rhythm, there is a high rate of atrial fibrillation recurrence,\n\n【79】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【80】Prediction of uneventful cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm from direct-current electrical cardioversion of chronic atrial fibrillation and flutter.\n\n【81】with as few as 23% of patients remaining in sinus rhythm after 1 year.

The risks and benefits of continuing the drug should be discussed with the patient. Baseline tests include chest radiography, pulmonary function tests, thyroid function tests, and transaminases. Hematologic, renal, and cardiac toxicities are uncommon; thus, CBC/peripheral smear/lactic acid dehydrogenase, sodium/potassium/creatinine, ECG Holter and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and cardiac catheterization are not routine studies before starting amiodarone.\n\n【95】Repeated TTE 2 months later showed a significantly improved EF of 52%, with mild–moderate left ventricular enlargement, mild generalized hypokinesis, and borderline right ventricular enlargement with borderline decreased systolic function and estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 32 mm Hg. The degree of mitral regurgitation had improved to mild–moderate severity and tricuspid regurgitation was trivial. The patient had a weight loss of 15 kg while taking furosemide and overall symptomatic improvement with increased exercise capacity.\n\n【96】Four months later, a repeated TTE revealed a decline in EF to 35%-40 %, with substantial beat-to-beat variability, return of atrial fibrillation with RVR, moderate left ventricular hypokinesis, borderline decrease in right ventricular systolic function, and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation and tricuspid regurgitation. His heart rate was 111 bpm. He underwent repeat direct current cardioversion. Follow-up TTE 2 months after repeated direct current cardioversion showed improvement of his EF again to 61% without regional wall motion abnormalities and a mildly enlarged left ventricle. Long-term therapy with amiodarone was discussed with this patient, but not pursued because of potential adverse effects.\n\n【97】Given recurrent episodes of atrial fibrillation, and subsequent reduced EF with each of these episodes, the decision was made to pursue a rhythm control strategy, and the patient underwent atrial fibrillation ablative therapy. He remained asymptomatic 6 months later, with no recurrent episodes, and maintained his left ventricular systolic function (EF = 61%).\n\n【98】Discussion\n----------\n\n【99】Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy (TIC) should be considered in a new diagnosis of heart failure, especially if the degree of left ventricular impairment is out of proportion to other comorbidities. This patient presented with CHF in the setting of new-onset atrial fibrillation with RVR. The improvement in LVEF from 25% to 52% after restoration of sinus rhythm, followed by a drop to 35% with return of atrial fibrillation with RVR, further supports the diagnosis of tachycardia-induced heart failure in this patient. Given the reduced LVEF, difficulty controlling heart rates, and his relatively young age, our patient was treated with cardioversion and a short course of amiodarone. He ultimately underwent ablative therapy because of his marked reduction in LVEF and high risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence.\n\n【100】TIC can be induced by a variety of tachyarrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【101】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【102】Tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy.\n\n【103】A prompt diagnosis and treatment of TIC is important given the potential reversibility.

There are no formal guidelines for follow-up, but suggested surveillance should include interval outpatient clinic visits with ECGs and TTEs. An outpatient ECG Holter monitor is suggested if symptoms occur.\n\n【117】Treatment of atrial fibrillation is initially dependent on hemodynamic stability of the patient. Had this patient been hemodynamically unstable, it would have been appropriate to pursue initial cardioversion. Rate control can be chosen for a patient who is in a hemodynamically stable condition.

In the acute setting, however, a rhythm control strategy can be considered, especially in the setting of symptoms or reduced LVEF.\n\n【127】Thus, rhythm control can be pursued when atrial fibrillation symptoms persist despite rate control, or depending on a patient’s comorbidities, age, and duration of atrial fibrillation. Direct current cardioversion is more effective than pharmacologic cardioversion.\n\n【128】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【129】Rhythm control in atrial fibrillation.\n\n【130】Pharmacologic choices for cardioversion include amiodarone, flecainide, propafenone, or sotalol.

Although the stomach and bowel loops were distended, no abrupt termination of distention (cutoff sign) suggestive of mechanical obstruction was observed. No obvious leaking from the packages was seen.Plain abdominal radiographs of the abdomen (anteroposterior and lateral views) taken at the time of admission showed the stomach and bowel were entirely loaded with numerous drug packets that had density similar to soft tissue.

On CT scanning and radiography 48 hours later, the abdomen appeared to be clear of drug packets. Customs agents collected 207 intact pellets of opium. Repeated imaging confirmed complete decontamination.\n\n【16】This case demonstrates the appearance of multiple drug packets using different imaging modalities and the importance of serial imaging in diagnosing and treating patients who are body packing.

Specifically, Bijlsma and associates evaluated our risk score in a cohort of 218 patients who had bacterial meningitis and a negative Gram stain. They discovered that our model had a high sensitivity (98.5%) but a very low specificity (9.2%) for identifying patients with meningitis and a negative Gram stain at risk for an adverse clinical outcome.\n\n【1】We derived and validated our prognostic model in a very large and heterogeneous patient population from the Houston, Texas, area that included meningitis caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and mycobacteria and in which only 22 of 567 patients (3.7%) had culture-proven bacterial meningitis. In contrast, the analysis by Bijlsma and colleagues included only bacterial meningitis cases, which are associated with higher adverse clinical outcomes.

This neurochemical finding furthers our understanding of this enigmatic sleep disorder typically characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations. Narcolepsy appears to be fundamentally related to abnormally regulated rapid eye movement sleep. The diagnosis of this disorder remains challenging because of multiple other conditions that can cause daytime sleepiness and the difficulties in recognizing cataplexy based on patient report. The role of hypocretins in narcolepsy is unclear but intriguing because the cell bodies are restricted to the lateral hypothalamus, a brain region long associated with sleep regulation, with neuronal widespread projections to areas including the locus ceruleus, ventral tegmental area, amygdala, and dorsal raphe. Hypocretins potentially modulate the activity of monoamines and acetylcholine, and therefore their absence leads to the multiple symptoms of narcolepsy.

Delivering Primary Preventive Services", "text": "【0】Clinical Preventive Medicine in Primary Care: Background and Practice: 2. Delivering Primary Preventive Services\nStrategies to incorporate preventive services into primary care settings have been underutilized. The first component of delivering preventive services in the primary care setting is the health risk assessment followed by establishment of practice guidelines and protocols for preventive services—who is eligible for what service (based on age, sex, and other clinical characteristics) and when. A computerized reminder system can be useful to track past and currently due preventive services for each patient and can also serve as a follow-up system for test results. Well-trained paramedical personnel can perform appropriate patient counseling and education. The goal of counseling and education is to change patient behavior. The first step in this difficult process is once again to ascertain health risks and then to determine the patient's stage of readiness—defined as precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance. The counselor assists in identification of target behavior, advocates and commends behavior change, reinforces health benefits of behavior change, offers resources, strategies, and support, and creates a plan of action and monitoring mechanisms. Improved implementation of preventive services in primary care could have a major impact on the health of the population.\n\n【1】The implementation of preventive services is high on the nation's agenda. The US Department of Health and Human Services has published _Healthy People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives_ .\n\n【2】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【3】Healthy People 2000: National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives.

Death is inevitable, and some may feel this is a valid argument against preventive services; ie, everyone dies of something. Preventing premature death and improving the health and quality of life through preventive efforts are far different than lengthening life without maintaining quality of life.\n\n【5】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【6】Preventive medicine for our ailing health care system.\n\n【7】An assessment of the progress toward the goals of Healthy People 2000 has been published.\n\n【8】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【9】Healthy People 2000 at mid decade.\n\n【10】Shortfalls were noted in attaining these goals, and corrections in the targets and strategies to achieve them are being proposed.\n\n【11】In clinical practice, at least 4 components are necessary for the successful delivery of preventive health care: knowledge, skills, attitude, and organizational structure.\n\n【12】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【13】*   Preventive Health Care Committee\n*   Society for Research and Education in Primary Care Internal Medicine\n\n【14】Preventive medicine in general internal medicine residency training.\n\n【15】Preferably, education about prevention should begin early in medical school and continue through residency training and on into practice.

The need for preventive services can be determined and screening tests can be ordered by nurses, nurse practitioners, and appointment secretaries using standard protocols. Appointments can be tied into computer reminder systems to notify patients when it is time for a test,\n\n【115】<sup><a>33</a></sup>\n\n【116】The effectiveness of mailed patient reminders on manrunography screening: a meta-analysis.\n\n【117】keeping in mind that not all patients want to participate in such a system.\n\n【118】<sup><a>34</a></sup>\n\n【119】Cancer screening behav-lors and attitudes of women in southeastern Minnesota.\n\n【120】Written materials are widely available from the American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, and other organizations to supplement verbal education from health care providers. It is important that handing out written material not take the place of a face-to-face encounter in which the patient can ask questions and voice concerns, and where the health care provider can deliver a personalized message.\n\n【121】Preventive Services Clinic\n--------------------------\n\n【122】At Mayo Clinic Rochester we have initiated a Preventive Services Clinic. This type of clinic has been shown to markedly increase prevention rates.\n\n【123】<sup><a>35</a></sup>\n\n【124】Implementing preventive services: success and failure in an outpatient trial.\n\n【125】Patients seen at Mayo Clinic and their relatives may participate in this clinic, the goal of which is to ensure screening tests and health promotion education are appropriately recommended. Many patients will have these items addressed during their general medical evaluation, but patients who are seen in a subspe-cialty area for a specific medical problem need to have their preventive services updated in addition to evaluation and treatment of their subspecialty medical problem.\n\n【126】In this model, which could be modified and used in virtually any medical practice, a patient first completes a health risk appraisal instrument—a questionnaire that inquires about health behaviors and demographic data. Based on responses to the questionnaire, an estimate of the risk of developing certain diseases and overall mortality is determined. Next, based on sex, age, and risk factor profile, each patient is scheduled for recommended screening tests including blood pressure measurement, lipid screening, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and a barium enema study. Women receive a Papanicolaou test and mammography. Information is provided to male patients regarding the pros and cons of prostate cancer screening, including digital rectal examination and prostate-specific antigen test, and testing is performed at the discretion of the health care provider and the patient, recognizing that proof supporting routine screening is not available at this time. Immunization status is updated. Patients also receive appropriate information and counseling from a health educator regarding nutrition, exercise, smoking cessation, and other health promotion activities. If medical problems are discovered, referral to the appropriate specialty area for further evaluation and treatment is available.\n\n【127】This clinic is staffed by a nurse practitioner, who is supervised by a physician and functions mainly by protocol with relatively little physician input unless problems are discovered. No symptomatic conditions are addressed; this is purely a preventive visit. It is hoped reimbursement will improve for this type of clinical activity as data accumulate documenting its effectiveness relative to the cost.\n\n【128】Components Of A Preventive Services Office Practice\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【129】To use this model effectively in a primary care practice, certain features should be emphasized . First, a health risk appraisal instrument or questionnaire should be selected, which gives desired information about the risk factor status of the patient. Second, common guidelines for preventive services should be established and protocols outlined so specific screening tests, immunizations, and health promotion counseling can be initiated automatically based on patient characteristics. Third, a reminder system or flow chart outlining which preventive services have already been provided and which ones are currently due should be established, possibly using a computer and preferably linked with the medical history. A record-keeping system is vital when incorporating preventive services into ongoing primary care. Fourth, it is desirable to have paramedical personnel available to coordinate testing, perform health promotion counseling, and provide written information and resources. Finally, a system for follow-up (perhaps also using a computer) of test results, abnormal test findings, and future preventive service recommendations should be in place. A system that works effectively in one office practice may not necessarily work in another. Therefore, these components and how they are incorporated into an office practice should be tailored to each practice. Although it would require some effort initially to incorporate such a system within an existing practice, once established it should function relatively smoothly and help ensure recommended preventive care.\n\n【130】Table 1 Desired Components of a Primary Care Preventive Services Office Practice\n\n| 1.Health risk appraisal2.Guidelines and protocols for preventive services3.Reminder system or flow chart outlining past and currently due preventive services4.Paramedical personnel to perform health promotion counseling and provide educational information5.Follow-up system for test results and future preventive services |\n| --- |\n\n【132】To enhance the delivery of preventive care in primary practice, the US Public Health Service initiated the Put Prevention Into Practice Campaign in 1994.

In the ambulatory setting immunization status can be part of a larger questionnaire on health risk assessment. A protocol can be established whereby, after a brief review of immunization status and potential contraindications, patients who are not up-to-date can automatically be scheduled to receive indicated immunizations that same day in the office. Once this is established, updating immunizations should require minimal time on the part of the physician. Paramedical personnel can assess the patient and administer appropriate immunizations. This model of providing immunizations by protocol can also be applied to other health care settings.

At Mayo-affiliated hospitals a program is in place to immunize all hospitalized patients unless there are contraindications. Protocols such as these require minimum physician input and therefore save on expenses while achieving the goal of increased vaccination rates. Patients should be encouraged to keep records of their immunization status. At the Mayo Clinic each patient seen in the Immunization Clinic is given a wallet-sized card containing a record of all immunizations received in addition to other important medical information.\n\n【201】### Health Promotion\n\n【202】Health promotion counseling and patient education can increase preventive behaviors.\n\n【203】<sup><a>48</a></sup>\n\n【204】A meta-analysis of trials evaluating patient education and counseling for three groups of preventive health behaviors.\n\n【205】There are 6 main steps for effective health promotion counseling . The initial step is an assessment of the demographic characteristics, health habits, and health risks of the patient. This assessment can be done either formally using a health risk appraisal instrument or informally during the medical history taking. Issues surrounding the use of health risk appraisals have been reviewed.\n\n【206】<sup><a>49</a></sup>\n\n【207】Health risk appraisal in the 1990s: opportunities, challenges, and expectations.\n\n【208】Many different health risk appraisals are in existence. _Healthier People,_ developed by the Carter Center and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is a widely used instrument. The benefits of using a written appraisal instrument include efficiency, completeness, a quantitative estimate of risk, and the ability to provide individualized written feedback concerning health risks and behavior change. Disadvantages of these instruments include lack of a personal message and concerns about the quality and overreliance on the data used to determine and express risk. For example, benefits of behavior change are sometimes reported as the additional time one can expect to live, yet the improved quality of life is not addressed. Stating on a report that exercising regularly will lead to an increase in life span of only a few months will probably not motivate many people. Health risk appraisals are popular in the workplace, and there is limited evidence that a health risk appraisal in combination with counseling can lead to behavior change in this setting.\n\n【209】<sup><a>50</a></sup>\n\n【210】The impact on factory workers of health risk appraisal and counseling in health promotion.\n\n【211】Table 3 Steps in Administering Health Promotion Counseling\n\n| 1.Define health risks2.Determine stage of readiness of the patient3.Advocate and commend behavior change4.Assist in identification of a target behavior; identify barriers vs benefits5.Reinforce health benefits of behavior change6.Offer resources, strategies, and support; create plan of action and monitoring mechanisms |\n| --- |\n\n【213】Health risk assessment can also be done informally by asking patients questions concerning their health habits. Suggested areas of discussion and possible questions to use in assessing these areas are outlined in Table 4 . This assessment can be combined with a health questionnaire the patient fills out ahead of time that can be reviewed when the medical history is taken. Although inquiring about all of these topics would appear to take a considerable amount of lime, in our experience use of a questionnaire and brief, pointed questions requires only a few minutes to complete the entire list. The questions in Table 4 attempt to gather the maximum amount of information in a minimum amount of time, which is necessary in a busy practice. For example, nutritional habits could be assessed by many methods, including food frequency questionnaires, dietary records, dietary recall, or detailed questions. Question 2 in Table 4 , if answered reasonably well, will give a fair amount of qualitative and rough quantitative information concerning typical food intakes, yet it does not require a great deal of time. Some of these risk areas can be addressed quickly if health habits are good, while answers to other questions that indicate a need for improvement may lead to follow-up questions and more in-depth inquiries, which can be pursued as necessary.\n\n【214】Table 4 Areas to Explore and Potential Questions During Informal Risk Assessment\n\n| --- |\n\n【216】A particularly difficult area is communicating risk to the patient. The goal in this is to help the patient understand what their risk factor profile means in terms of the likelihood of future morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. There are many different ways to express risk—absolute risk (10 per 100,000), relative risk (twice as likely to get a disease compared with someone who doesn't have a particular risk factor), or risk age (40 years based on an individual's risk factor profile compared with their chronologic age of 37 years). Each of these measurements has potential problems and can be intuitively difficult for patients to understand. Another approach is to combine relative risk with absolute risk and explain this to the patient. This will give the patient an idea about how important it is to change a specific risk factor along with a perspective on the overall likelihood of disease. For example, one could say, “Someone with a scrum total cholesterol of 250 mg/dL such as you is twice as likely to develop coronary heart disease over his lifetime compared with someone with a total cholesterol of 200. In addition, coronary heart disease is the most common cause of death.” This should be followed by a discussion of the benefits of changing behaviors (eg, diet) and providing resources to help facilitate change .\n\n【217】The second step that can be helpful in health promotion counseling is determining the stage of readiness or motivation of the patient. The stages of change include (1) precontemplation: not thinking about changing behavior; (2) contemplation: considering changing behavior in the foreseeable future; (3) preparation: making plans for changing behavior in the near future; (4) action: in the process of changing behavior; and (5) maintenance: continuing behavior changes for an extended period.\n\n【218】<sup><a>52</a></sup>\n\n【219】Stages of change in the modification of problem behaviors.\n\n【220】A reasonable goal is to try to help the patient progress from one stage to the next. It is important to realize that a person may relapse through these stages several times prior to making a permanent change. Therefore, past attempts at behavior change should be determined along with the reason they did not work over the long term. The stages of change have been used to describe behavioral change in at least a dozen different areas, including diet, safer sexual activity, exercise, and smoking cessation.\n\n【221】<sup><a>53</a></sup>\n\n【222】Stages of change and decisional balance for 12 problem behaviors.\n\n【223】The third step from Table 3 in administering health promotion counseling is to advocate and commend behavior charge. An important factor in motivating patients to change behavior is the relationship between the patient and the health care provider. The health care provider's role is to provide information, resources, and a supportive environment to facilitate behavior change. During the initial portion of the patient—health care provider encounter the health care provider is gathering information while building and establishing a relationship. Critical aspects during this time are the clinician's ability to listen, empathize, legitimize, and support the patient. This is truly the art of medicine and underlies the success of many outstanding clinicians.\n\n【224】Reading the patient correctly sets the stage for individual recommendations. Some people respond to a “soft sell” approach. A direct and frank approach works better for others. In either case it is important to make recommendations in a manner that the patient can understand. When counseling patients, it is important to be optimistic and empathic, yet at the same time give clear, unequivocal messages that impress on the patient the importance of making the behavioral change. For example, when seeing patients who smoke, the clinician must acknowledge, with appropriate empathy and without judgment, the difficulties of quitting. However, a firm recommendation to stop smoking should always be given to the patient.\n\n【225】Health care providers develop their own style of counseling. Sometimes this is based on a personal experience that can help to illustrate a point and motivate a patient if used effectively. Outlined in Table 5 arc examples of brief counseling messages that can be used in a few areas of health promotion. These brief examples of “sound bites” can be used in counseling at the same time an informal health risk assessment is being performed. In some cases, such as discussing postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy, a longer discussion is necessary. These discussions can be supplemented with written material and referrals to paramedical personnel for more detailed education and counseling.\n\n【226】Table 5 Examples of Brief Counseling Messages\n\n| **Smoking cessation:** ”The most important thing you can do for your long-term health is to quit smoking, no matter how difficult it is. If you quit now, it is likely you will live longer and healthier. There are medications and programs available to help you quit.“ |\n| --- |\n| **Nutrition (general):** ”Two important dietary changes people can make are to eat less fat and to eat more fruits and vegetables. One way to begin doing this is to eat one less serving of meat and one more serving of fruit and vegetables each day compared to what you are currently eating.” (It is important to tell people not only what _not_ to eat, but also what _to_ eat.) |\n| **Exercise:** ”Current recommendations are to try to obtain at least 30 minutes of moderately vigorous physical activity daily such as vigorous walking or climbing stairs. Any activity is good activity, but if you begin to participate in formal exercise, I would recommend that you choose an exercise that you enjoy, that you can perform regularly and consistently, and that you strive to continue indefinitely.“ |\n| **Seat belt use:** ”Even if you're a good driver, accidents can happen very quickly, even around your own neighborhood. Wearing your seat belt could save your life someday. Besides, after a little while, it becomes a habit and you'll feel bare without it.“ |\n\n【228】Patients should be involved in choosing which behavior to work on . A health care provider may have an idea about what they would like the patient to change and can express this to the patient in terms of health risks, but the patient may have different views. Moreover, if patients disagree with a dogmatic recommendation, they will do what they want after leaving anyway. All the areas of health promotion listed in Table 4 should be assessed, and perhaps a brief health behavior message delivered during health promotion counseling. However, it may be desirable to focus on only 1 major behavioral change at a time so as not to overwhelm the patient with too many changes at once. Part of assisting in identification of the target behavior is assessing the barriers vs the benefits of changing a behavior and personalizing this for the patient. Encouraging the patient to consider these issues should help the patient arrive at a plan that is realistic and well thought out.\n\n【229】Once a target behavior is identified, the physician should reinforce the health benefits specific to that behavior change . For example, confirming and discussing the many benefits of regular exercise can provide further information to a patient and can be a strong motivating factor as well.\n\n【230】Offering resources, strategies, and support as well as appropriate referrals are all part of formulating a plan of action . The patient's stage of change should be considered and be a primary determinant of the type of intervention recommended. For someone in the precontemplation stage, just providing literature and information may be all that is appropriate. Giving advice on taking action may be ineffective for this patient. On the other hand, for someone in the action stage, providing specific help in making the change can be important.\n\n【231】Just as involving the patient in choosing which health behavior to work on is important, it is also important to involve the patient in designing the plan of action. It should be clear to patients that they are the ones who are responsible for their health behaviors. If available, appropriate referrals could be considered to a dietitian, physician—nutrition specialist, exercise physiologist, physical therapist, sports medicine physician, nicotine dependence counselor, or patient education specialist. Identifying appropriate goals should be included in this plan of action. Patients should be encouraged to formulate goals that are specific, measurable, and realistic. Finally, monitoring is necessary to follow through on the behavior change. A specific plan for follow-up should be in place as well as a plan in case of relapse.\n\n【232】### Chemoprevention\n\n【233】In recent years, increasing interest has focused on chemoprevention as a means of preventing disease, particularly in the area of cancer.\n\n【234】<sup><a>54</a></sup>\n\n【235】Cancer chemoprcvention, part 1: retinoids and carotcnoids and other classic antioxidants.\n\n【236】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【237】<sup><a>55</a></sup>\n\n【238】Cancer chemoprcvention, part 2: hormones, nonclassic antioxidant natural agents, NSAIDs, and other agents.\n\n【239】Chemoprevention includes a wide variety of compounds such as vitamins and other nutrients (retinoids, carotenoids, antioxidants), hormonally related agents (tamoxifen, dehydroepian-drosterone, finasteride), phytochemteals (genistein from soybeans, allyl sulfides from onions and garlic, isothio-cyanates from cruciferous vegetables), and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin, sulindac). Chemoprevention could be primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention. Taking folic acid to prevent neural tube defects is an example of primary prevention. Tamoxifen treatment could be either secondary prevention (taken by someone with proliferative breast disease who is at high risk for breast cancer) or tertiary prevention (taken by someone with established breast cancer to prevent recurrence). It is beyond the scope of this article to review the details of the different types of chemoprevention, but a few comments are in order.\n\n【240】When taking a substance for chemoprevention, the patient must be aware of the potential risks as well as the benefits. It is particularly unfortunate when a healthy person is taking an agent for prevention of a condition and an adverse event occurs. For example, beta carotene supplementation was believed to be protective against cancer and cardiovascular disease after observational studies reported that increased dietary intake and blood levels of beta carotene were associated with a reduced risk of these conditions. Moreover, the risk of adverse effects of taking a dietary supplement such as beta carotene was believed to be small. However, large-scale randomized trials reported no benefit, and 2 large studies showed an increase in lung cancer mortality and overall mortality in smokers who took beta carotene supplements.\n\n【241】<sup><a>56</a></sup>\n\n【242】*   Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta Carotene Cancer Prevention Study Group\n\n【243】The effect of vitamin E and beta carotene on the incidence of lung cancer and other cancers in male smokers.\n\n【244】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【245】<sup><a>57</a></sup>\n\n【246】Effects of a combination of beta carotene and vitamin A on lung cancer and cardiovascular disease.\n\n【247】Anodier related point is that there is no quality control for dietary supplements, and therefore the potential for contamination, inaccurate dose, and other adverse consequences is always present.\n\n【248】Aspirin deserves specific mention because it is widely used for chemoprevention against coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease and is promising for preventing colon polyps and cancer.\n\n【249】<sup><a>58</a></sup>\n\n【250】*   Antiplatelct Trialists' Collaboration\n\n【251】Collaborative overview of randomised trials of antiplatelet therapy, I: prevention of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke by prolonged antiplatelet therapy in various categories of patients Ipublishcd correction appears in _BMJ._ 1994:308:1540\\].\n\n【252】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【253】<sup><a>59</a></sup>\n\n【254】Antithrombotic agents in coronary artery disease.\n\n【255】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【256】<sup><a>60</a></sup>\n\n【257】Antiplatelet therapy in coronary artery disease: review and update of efficacy studies.\n\n【258】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【259】<sup><a>61</a></sup>\n\n【260】Aspirin and gastrointestinal cancer.\n\n【261】The evidence for aspirin in the tertiary prevention of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease is strong.\n\n【262】<sup><a>58</a></sup>\n\n【263】*   Antiplatelct Trialists' Collaboration\n\n【264】Collaborative overview of randomised trials of antiplatelet therapy, I: prevention of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke by prolonged antiplatelet therapy in various categories of patients Ipublishcd correction appears in _BMJ._ 1994:308:1540\\].\n\n【265】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【266】<sup><a>59</a></sup>\n\n【267】Antithrombotic agents in coronary artery disease.\n\n【268】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【269】<sup><a>60</a></sup>\n\n【270】Antiplatelet therapy in coronary artery disease: review and update of efficacy studies.\n\n【271】In general, aspirin (75-325 mg/d) should be considered for patients with a history of coronary heart disease, stroke, or transient ischemic attack, provided there are no contraindications.

Obstructive sleep apnea is a common medical condition characterized by recurrent episodes of breathing cessation during sleep associated with collapse of the upper airway. Such apneas may be associated with oxygen desaturation and often are terminated by brief arousal from sleep.\n\n【1】One of the first major reports describing the possible adverse consequences of sleep apnea came from the Henry Ford Hospital in 1988.\n\n【2】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【3】Mortality and apnea index in obstructive sleep apnea: experience in 385 male patients.\n\n【4】A significant increase in mortality was reported during an 8-year period in patients with severe OSAS compared with those with less severe OSAS. This increase in mortality was mitigated by both tracheostomy (up to that time the most accepted treatment of severe OSAS) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Subsequently, several more studies\n\n【5】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【6】Long-term outcome for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients: mortality.\n\n【7】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【8】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【9】Mortality in sleep apnea patients: a multivariate analysis of risk factors.\n\n【10】corroborated this finding of increased mortality associated with OSAS. What is the cause of this increase?\n\n【11】Several studies have revealed a 2 to 3 times greater incidence of automobile crashes related to excessive daytime sleepiness in many patients with OSAS.\n\n【12】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【13】Automobile accidents involving patients with obstructive sleep apnea.\n\n【14】Performance in driving simulators is impaired in patients with OSAS but improves when the patients are treated with CPAP.\n\n【15】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【16】Driving simulator performance in patients with sleep apnea.\n\n【17】Also, OSAS is associated with an increased risk of numerous cardiovascular diseases. For example, OSAS has been associated with an increased prevalence of arterial hypertension both in animal studies\n\n【18】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【19】Obstructive sleep apnea as a cause of systemic hypertension: evidence from a canine model.\n\n【20】and in large epidemiological studies such as the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study\n\n【21】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【22】Prospective study of the association between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension.\n\n【23】and the National Institutes of Health–sponsored Sleep Heart Health Study.\n\n【24】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【25】Association of sleep-disordered breathing, sleep apnea, and hypertension in a large community-based study .\n\n【26】Furthermore, OSAS is associated with an increased prevalence of coronary artery disease and stroke.\n\n【27】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【28】Sleep apnea in acute cerebrovascular diseases: final report on 128 patients.\n\n【29】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【30】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【31】Sleep-disordered breathing and cardiovascular disease: cross-sectional results of the Sleep Heart Health Study.\n\n【32】One remarkable finding in these studies is that even mild OSAS is associated with an increased prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. Sleep-disordered breathing is common in patients with congestive heart failure.\n\n【33】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【34】Occult sleep-disordered breathing in stable congestive heart failure .\n\n【35】Treatment of OSAS in patients with congestive heart failure has improved survival rates and left ventricular ejection fractions.\n\n【36】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【37】Controlled trial of continuous positive airway pressure in obstructive sleep apnea and heart failure.\n\n【38】Together, these findings clearly show that OSAS is a serious condition with major health-related consequences and that identification of patients with OSAS is important.\n\n【39】In 1993, the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study\n\n【40】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【41】The occurrence of sleep-disordered breathing among middle-aged adults.\n\n【42】reported that in individuals aged 30 to 65 years, the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing could be as high as 9% in women and 24% in men (although the calculated prevalence depended on the definition used). Prevalence rates may be higher in the elderly population. However, because of the increase in the epidemic of obesity in the US population,\n\n【43】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【44】Action on obesity: report of a Mayo Clinic National Summit.\n\n【45】undoubtedly these estimates of the prevalence of OSAS have increased accordingly. Recent data show that sleep-disordered breathing may be common in children as well, especially in children who are overweight, have large tonsils, snore loudly, or have craniofacial abnormalities. Children with sleep-disordered breathing may experience impaired cognitive function and impaired school performance.\n\n【46】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【47】Neurobehavioral implications of habitual snoring in children.\n\n【48】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【49】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【50】Neurobehavioral correlates of sleep-disordered breathing in children.\n\n【51】The gold standard in the diagnosis of OSAS is facility-based polysomnography.\n\n【52】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【53】The indications for polysomnography and related procedures.\n\n【54】Polysomnography is used to monitor electroencephalographic activity, muscle activity, and various cardiorespiratory parameters including airflow, respiratory effort, oximetry, and electrocardiographic activity. A trained polysomnographic technician monitors the patient in real time, makes adjustments for faulty signals, and analyzes and scores the data. The studies are interpreted by sleep specialists. However, in many communities, the number of beds is insufficient to accommodate the demand for sleep studies. As a result, there is often a delay between the time a primary care physician initially suspects the diagnosis and the time that OSAS is diagnosed and treated with CPAP. Hence, there have been efforts to identify alternative ways of diagnosing OSAS or to identify patients who should receive highest priority for sleep study and treatment. Unattended home polysomnography has been proposed, but a recent meta-analysis found insufficient data to recommend its routine clinical use.\n\n【55】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【56】Practice parameters for the use of portable monitoring devices in the investigation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in adults.\n\n【57】Oximetry is easy to use, reliable, and generally available.

Specifically, they examined how oximetry results influenced the referral of patients to sleep specialists for polysomnography. Of 100 results from ambulatory overnight oximetry, 79 were abnormal. Among patients with abnormal oximetry results, only 51 (65%) were referred for sleep-related consultation. Of the 51 patients for whom sleep consultation was recommended, only 24 actually completed the consultation, and of those 24, only 19 completed polysomnography. However, patients with the most severe abnormal results from ambulatory overnight oximetries had expedited evaluations and were seen more quickly for sleep consultation and sleep study than were those with mildly abnormal oximetry results. The reasons why patients with abnormal results from ambulatory overnight oximetries were not referred for sleep consultation were not recorded in this study but may provide the basis for an additional study to look at both physician and patient attitudes toward OSAS, the factors that influence a physician's decision to recommend sleep consultation, and the factors that influence a patient's decision to possibly decline that consultation.\n\n【61】Nevertheless, the work by Martinez et al is important because it identifies potential limitations in the use of ambulatory overnight oximetry in diagnosing OSAS, even when the diagnosis is suspected initially by the general internist. Even with abnormal results from oximetry, not all patients are referred for sleep consultation, and of those patients advised to have consultation, not all follow through with it. Clearly, in the future we will need to look at alternative diagnostic and treatment strategies in an attempt to accommodate the many patients with OSAS. Sleep specialists will need to work closely with primary care physicians to identify and treat these patients. Further research on home unattended studies will be necessary. Also, the use of mid-level practitioners such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners to enhance access to sleep centers will need to be considered and studied. Obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome represents a large public health burden. Effective treatment is available, but diagnostic and treatment strategies must be improved for the many patients with this condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "d57c03dc-8e00-45f7-a0c4-9d8347424be2", "title": "Compassion in a Crisis", "text": "【0】Compassion in a Crisis\nThe disruption to health care delivery introduced by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic suggests a near-term future very different from a few months ago. Among the many lessons learned are the value of preparing for unpredictable medical events and the need for high-human-touch health care when serious situations arise.\n\n【1】In addition to logistical questions, there is a compelling existential one: “How should health care address patient and caregiver distress and uncertainty from life-threatening situations?”\n\n【2】We believe that the principles and practices of palliative care are one answer to this question. Palliative care is both a care philosophy and specialty clinical service that provides relief from the symptoms and stress of a serious illness with the goal of improving quality of life for both the patient and the family.\n\n【3】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【4】Generalist plus specialist palliative care — creating a more sustainable model.\n\n【5】The philosophy of palliative care views every human being as deserving of the best quality of life regardless of social circumstances or health condition. Thus, we use the term “palliative care” to designate the foundational and universal responsibility of all health professionals to relieve suffering through pain and symptom management, skilled communication, and support for the best possible quality of life. For patients with serious illnesses, attention by all clinicians to the experience of living with a serious illness is like oxygen: vital to thriving and stifling when absent. This is everyone’s job.\n\n【6】During situations of medical complexity or times of overwhelming uncertainty, clinicians consult specialty palliative care teams to provide an extra layer of support. This phrase reflects a field-wide commitment to help as needed, when needed, in support of all. For more than a decade, interprofessional specialty palliative care teams have integrated into outpatient clinics, emergency departments, hospital floors, intensive care units, and home- and nursing home–based care delivery. Access to hospital-based consultation teams has nearly quadrupled in the last 2 decades.\n\n【7】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【8】The growth of palliative care in US hospitals: a status report.\n\n【9】An expanding evidence base shows that integrating specialty palliative care into usual care improves many patient, caregiver, and health system outcomes of importance.\n\n【10】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【11】Palliative care for the seriously ill.\n\n【12】The national pandemic has highlighted the role of palliative care when stakes are high, uncertainty is rampant, and possible health outcomes are troubling. Specialty palliative care teams across the country have worked with interprofessional colleagues to develop and disseminate resources to guide goals of care discussions, processes for connecting geographically distant families and patients, tools for compassionate and truthful conversations, and safe and straightforward protocols for symptom management.\n\n【13】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【14】CAPC. COVID-19 Response Resources. 2020\n\n【15】These efforts emphasize quickly building and scaling palliative care capacity for all clinicians.\n\n【16】Further, specialty palliative care teams have quickly expanded their own capacity to care for the most complex patients. For example, teams have established designated inpatient units for the critically ill, organized 24/7 hotline telephone programs for distance-based conversations with patients and worried love ones, created debriefing sessions for stressed and morally distressed health care colleagues, participated in tough system-level discussions regarding resource allocation, and integrated into emergency department and intensive care unit teams to provide just-in-time support. The demand for palliative care services from our colleagues across the continuum is unprecedented. These experiences reflect that when the going gets tough, the principles and practices of palliative care are essential and foundational to high-quality care.\n\n【17】The current crisis underscores two principles of palliative care which should integrate across all of health care, even outside of an active crisis. First, discussing and documenting health care preferences — commonly referred to as advance care planning — is essential for everyone, regardless of age or health status. A global pandemic reminds us all of the fragility of human life, and the universal need for knowing one is receiving “the right care” however that is defined by the person. Recent events have increased the feasibility of advance care planning as insurers and regulators now allow clinician billing for telehealth-based delivery. Experiences to date have been positive, including high feasibility of remotely performed conversations, and strong willingness of patients and families to engage with an array of clinical team members, not just physicians.\n\n【18】Second, a core principle of palliative care is that of understanding the whole patient, including their life, their loved ones, and community. This involves understanding both medical and non-medical sources of strength and distress, such as social, cultural, spiritual, financial, and emotional factors. The pandemic has illuminated the importance of these domains on access to high-quality care. As the crisis waxes and wanes, disadvantaged populations lack financial and other reserves necessary to compensate for job and health insurance losses. Thus, the purposeful understanding of the person beyond the chief complaint and the problem list, coupled with questions about the role of the health care system in addressing social determinants of health, will be critical.\n\n【19】As the pandemic subsides, financially strapped health care organizations may be tempted to de-prioritize all poorly reimbursed cognitive services, including specialty palliative care teams. But we believe the opposite should occur. The ongoing need for high-touch support for the 45 million patients with serious conditions will persist,\n\n【20】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【21】Dying in America: improving quality and honoring individual preferences near the end of life.\n\n【22】heightened by the millions who avoided medical care out of fear of entering the health care system. The rapid scaling of telehealth and other home-based care delivery techniques to care for seriously ill patients will lean heavily upon compassionate communication and distress management skills intrinsic to palliative care. Lastly, planning for the next public health crisis, akin to helping individual patients plan for changes in their own health, will require population-health level efforts to match health care resources and capacity to the needs, values, and preferences of the people they serve.\n\n【23】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【24】Why population health and palliative care need each other.\n\n【25】The current national crisis reminds us of the individual crises faced by our patients and their loved ones, from the time of diagnosis of a serious illness onwards. And such crises indelibly alter the course of patients’ lives and relationships, threaten quality of life, introduce fear and uncertainty, and require meticulous attention to both medical and non-medical sources of distress. As we reflect on the implications of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, one lesson learned is clear. In times of uncertainty and complexity, palliative care should stand shoulder-to-shoulder with patients, caregiver, clinicians, and health systems to contribute to hoping for the best, and planning for the rest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

In his youth, his uncle taught him carpentry and he became facile with a saw, a skill that served him well in his later life as an orthopedic surgeon. After finishing secondary school in Saint Pierre, he obtained a scholarship to the French Institute in London (which had been temporarily moved to Scotland due to World War II) and crossed the Atlantic alone on a troop ship in 1944. At the time of his journey, he spoke no English, and had never seen a railroad train or visited a large city.\n\n【1】In 1946, a few months after the end of the war, Emile went to the University of Paris to study medicine. He developed an interest in orthopedic surgery. To apply for a postgraduate position to continue his education, he had to visit all of the relevant faculty members and present letters of recommendation, but he had no letters to present. A friend recommended that he see Professor Robert Judet (1909-1980). After a cursory interview, Judet offered Letournel a 6-month position beginning in 1956, despite his lack of letters. This 6-month trial soon became a permanent appointment as Judet’s assistant at Hôpital Raymond-Poincaré in Garches, a residential community in the western suburbs of Paris. Judet’s research focused on pelvic fractures, so Letournel began to study these as well.\n\n【2】In 1961, Letournel published his University of Paris graduation thesis, “ _Les fractures du cotyle. Etude d’une serie de 75 cas_ ” (“Fractures of the acetabulum: Studies on a series of 75 cases”), which included the first classification of acetabular fractures based on their radiographic appearance and brought him to the attention of the wider surgical community. Letournel continued to work with Judet until Judet’s retirement in 1978.\n\n【3】Letournel advanced to the rank of Professor at the University of Paris in 1970 and became head of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the Centre Médico-Chirurgical de la Port de Choisy in southeast Paris. He remained at Choisy — a non-profit hospital — until his retirement in October 1993.\n\n【4】Letournel soon became the best-known acetabular surgeon in the world, training numerous young physicians and regularly hosting visiting colleagues. He developed a database for the statistical analysis of both immediate and long-term results of treatment of acetabular fractures, published dozens of articles, and organized the first acetabular fracture educational course in Paris in 1984. In addition to his classification system for injuries, he developed 2 major surgical approaches (ilioinguinal and extended iliofemoral), innovative fracture reduction techniques, and instrument and implant designs that continue to be used in many orthopedic operating theaters.\n\n【5】Emile Letournel published several major textbooks on acetabular surgery. The first was in French, “Fractures du Cotyle,” and published in 1974. The second book was in English, “Fractures of the Acetabulum” published in 1981, and another with the same title followed in 1993.\n\n【6】Letournel’s contributions to orthopedics were not limited to acetabular fractures. He implanted the first knee prosthesis in France in 1968, performed more than 6000 total hip arthroplasties, devised a scapulothoracic arthrodesis technique for patients with fascio-scapulohumeral myopathy, developed implant designs and surgical techniques for management of calcaneal fractures, and regularly performed operations for bone infections.\n\n【7】He was admitted to the French Academie de Medicine et Chirurgie in 1981 and received the Legion d’Honneur from President François Mitterrand in 1988. He became known to the French general public after he operated on several Formula 1 race car drivers, including Jacques Laffite and Didier Pironi, and other notables such as the great chef Michel Chabran.\n\n【8】On August 16, 1994, at the age of 66, Emile Letournel died unexpectedly. Shortly before his death, he completed his 1050th surgery for an acetabular fracture. Following his death, his name was given to the Lycée and to a street in Saint Pierre et Miquelon. Emile Letournel was honored philatelically by Saint Pierre et Miquelon in 1999 (Scott #676).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The challenges are enormous.\n\n【1】In May 2004, the Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services, Tommy G. Thompson, announced the appointment of a National Health Information Technology Coordinator to oversee the realization of President George W. Bush's then recently announced goal of ensuring that most Americans have electronic records within 10 years.\n\n【2】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【3】*   US Department of Health and Human Services\n\n【4】Secretary Thompson, seeking fastest possible results, names first Health Information Technology Coordinator.\n\n【5】Secretary Thompson stated: “Health information technology promises huge benefits, and we need to move quickly across many fronts to capture these benefits.” This was to be achieved by setting up secure local, regional, and national electronic networks that “would allow a doctor or health care provider to access an always-up-to-date electronic health record of a patient who has agreed to be part of the system, regardless of when and where the patient receives care.” He estimated that such a health information network could save the United States about $140 billion annually through improved care and reduced duplication of medical tests.\n\n【6】The additional $50 million proposed by President Bush's administration to help get the initiative off the ground is insignificant compared with the 6 billion pounds sterling ($10.5 billion) allocated by the United Kingdom government for its ambitious goal of modernizing and expanding information technology within the National Health Service (NHS) in England.\n\n【7】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【8】NHS Connecting for Health. A guide to the National Programme for Information Technology.\n\n【9】The program is coordinated by the Department of Health agency, NHS Connecting for Health. Fundamental to it is the creation of a national broadband secure network linking all NHS organizations in England to enable reliable and secure data exchange. Its components include the national NHS Care Record, electronic transmission of prescriptions from physicians to pharmacies, national access via Picture Archiving and Communication Systems networks to stored x-rays and images, and an electronic appointment booking service, Choose and Book, for patients referred from primary to specialist care. The brief for the NHS Care Record is similar to that proposed in the United States, with a Detailed Care Record that contains a comprehensive electronic patient record and a Summary Care Record that contains essential information such as allergies and medication. Access to each component will be regulated according to individual patient wishes and clinical need. The target date for full implementation of this ambitious program is 2010.\n\n【10】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【11】NHS Connecting for Health. A guide to the National Programme for Information Technology.\n\n【12】The European Union, of which the United Kingdom is a member, has recognized the importance of promoting the structured development of e-Health and has established several goals for its 25 member states to achieve by 2010.\n\n【13】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【14】*   Commission of the European Communities\n\n【15】e-Health — making healthcare better for European citizens: an action plan for a European e-Health area.\n\n【16】One of these is as follows: “By end 2006, Member States, in collaboration with the European Commission, should identify and outline interoperability standards for health data messages and electronic health records.” Some European states have embraced e-Health with enthusiasm. Finland, for instance, is well advanced in its plans to have a comprehensive nationwide electronic health record in place by the end of 2007.\n\n【17】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【18】The core data elements of electronic health record in Finland.\n\n【19】This year (2006) sees the phased introduction of an electronic Gesundheitskarte (health card) for Germany's 80 million citizens. This smart card will contain core data about the patient and, dependent on individual consent, links to stored health information, including patient notes, medications, and electronically stored images.\n\n【20】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【21】Bundesministerium für Gesundheit. Die Gesundheitskarte.\n\n【22】Underpinning the successful implementation of such programs is the availability of a structured terminology that is sophisticated enough to record the important elements of health care in a systematic way, without being unduly restrictive in the range of terms and language required by the numerous individuals, groups, and organizations who will be expected to use it. Exchanging information accurately among widely differing users depends crucially on capturing information in a precise, standardized, and reproducible fashion. This is simply illustrated by off-patent medications wherein one drug may be dispensed under a bewildering number of different proprietary names. A comprehensive medical terminology must be able to link all these to its approved generic name. The situation is much more complex when clinical findings or diagnoses have to be recorded. Most physicians would recognize that the established terminologies, in particular the World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases and its Clinical Modification, are not up to the task.\n\n【23】It is not only for the purposes of the individual medical record that a sophisticated medical terminology is required. Within any field of collective endeavor, the ability of people to communicate accurately and unambiguously with each other is vital to the advancement of knowledge. One of the most fundamental components of scientific communication is a comprehensive vocabulary that encompasses all aspects of the discipline under study. A core component of such a vocabulary is a comprehensive and up-to-date taxonomy or classification. This incorporates not only 1 or more labels by which a concept may be uniquely identified but also the hierarchical relationships between concepts. In the field of medicine, physicians rely on classifications of disease and the agents that cause disease to help them make sense of the multitude of ways in which disease may present. As an everyday example, the knowledge that a certain disease is caused by a virus informs the physician that it is unlikely to respond to treatment with an antibiotic effective against bacteria. A major challenge to today's taxonomists is the explosion in the understanding of molecular biology and genetics, which demands that completely new classifications are created to explain what have frequently been unexplained associations of seemingly diverse phenotypic expressions of disease. Classifications will always need to evolve and be modified to take into account new knowledge and understanding of disease.\n\n【24】For several decades, teams in the United States and in the United Kingdom have been trying to address the deficiencies of existing terminologies by developing new, more comprehensive thesauri. SNOMED ( **S** ystematized **No** menclature of **Med** icine) has been under development by the College of American Pathologists since the 1970s. The United Kingdom equivalent, Clinical Terms, began in the early 1980s as Read Codes (named after their creator, Dr James Read) and became popular within United Kingdom general practice for computerized coding. In the mid-1990s, they were renamed Clinical Terms and expanded to cover the whole health care field in a large United Kingdom government-funded project involving more than 40 Specialty Working Groups. In 1999, the 2 involved organizations merged the 2 terminologies as SNOMED CT. The amalgamated thesaurus now incorporates more than 300,000 distinct health care concepts and more than 1 million descriptive terms.\n\n【25】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【26】*   SNOMED International\n\n【27】SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) Core Content for the January 2006 Release.\n\n【28】In the United Kingdom, SNOMED CT has been designated the preferred clinical terminology for the NHS; in July 2003, the US Department of Health and Human Services, through the National Library of Medicine, came to an agreement with the College of American Pathologists and its subsidiary, SNOMED International, to support the continued upkeep and development of SNOMED CT with the aim of promoting it as the standard for health care information exchange in the United States.\n\n【29】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【30】*   National Library of Medicine\n\n【31】HHS launches new efforts to promote paperless health care system.\n\n【32】SNOMED CT can probably justifiably be considered unsurpassed in the number of health care concepts available within it. Additionally, SNOMED CT has the major potential advantage over previous terminologies such as the International Classification of Diseases in its ability to encode complex concepts by creating compositional expressions such as, for instance, disease A _due to_ agent B wherein the disease and the agent can be linked by the qualifying expression _due to._ However, there are concerns that nonsense compositional expressions are permitted. Another important feature of SNOMED CT is its multi-axial hierarchical structure that allows records to be searched or aggregated from different standpoints; for example, streptococcal sore throat would be located both under streptococcal infection and under pharyngitis. There are again concerns that the automatic rules used for building hierarchies within SNOMED CT can lead to nonsense relationships. Therefore, it is essential that proper mechanisms are in place for quality assurance.\n\n【33】Despite the large amount of work undertaken on both sides of the Atlantic in assembling SNOMED CT, little formal assessment of its fitness for purpose has been undertaken to date. In this issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Dr Elkin and collaborators, from the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minn, and from the Department of Veteran Affairs, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tenn, have examined how well SNOMED CT performs in encoding the 5000 most common clinical problems encountered in episodes of inpatient or outpatient care as recorded in the Mayo Master Sheet Index.\n\n【34】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【35】Evaluation of the content coverage of SNOMED CT: ability of SNOMED Clinical Terms to represent clinical problem lists.\n\n【36】Forty-nine of the 5000 identified problems were excluded as not being appropriate or sensible, leaving 4951 for comparison with SNOMED CT. Just over half were found to have an exact match. Use of the authors' Mayo Clinic Vocabulary Server and Browser tools to create additional compositional expressions within SNOMED CT produced a further 1765 matches, increasing the sensitivity from 51% to 87%. This illustrates the importance of such compositional expressions within SNOMED CT. Manual addition of synonyms and missing modifiers to SNOMED CT produced a further 243 matches, increasing overall sensitivity to 92%. The authors conclude that SNOMED CT has the ability to represent a large proportion of the terms seen commonly in medical problem lists but that further work is required to add missing synonyms and modifiers. They recommend that health care organizations be encouraged and given incentives to adopt SNOMED CT.\n\n【37】The governments of the United States and of the United Kingdom have given official support to SNOMED CT as their preferred health care terminology. Dr Elkin and his colleagues have demonstrated that common clinical problems can, in general, be satisfactorily encoded by SNOMED CT. Since physicians, in common with all health care workers, are likely to be compelled to use SNOMED CT, it is in their interests to ensure that it caters adequately to their needs. To achieve this, all branches of medicine need to nominate representatives to examine its content for accuracy and comprehensiveness. Several specialties have thus set up Working Groups in collaboration with SNOMED International to review the content of the terminology for its fitness-for-purpose. For example, dermatologists have recently been able to add more than 2000 missing concepts to SNOMED CT by working together with SNOMED International and are planning to examine content further by comparison with the officially recognized disease indexes of the American Academy of Dermatology and British Association of Dermatologists.

The survey included 2 items from the Maslach Burnout Inventory and items on their immediate supervisor leadership behaviors. Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the relationship between the leadership score and the prevalence of burnout and satisfaction after adjusting for age, sex, duration of employment, and job category. Sensitivity analysis was performed using mixed models with a random intercept for work unit to assess the impact of the correlation within work units on burnout and satisfaction with the organization.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of the 57,414 employees surveyed, 39,896 (69.5%) responded and answered the leadership questions. Supervisor scores in each dimension and composite leadership scores correlated with burnout and satisfaction of employees ( _P_ <.001 for all). In logistic regression, each 1-point increase in leadership score was associated with a 7% decrease in odds of burnout and an 11% increase in odds of satisfaction ( _P_ <.001 for both) of employees. The mean composite leadership score rating of each immediate supervisor correlated with rate of burnout ( _r_ \\=−0.247; _P_ <.001) and the satisfaction with the organization ( _r_ \\=0.416; _P_ <.001) at the work unit level.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Leadership qualities of immediate supervisors relate to burnout and satisfaction of nonphysician health care employees working in a large organization.

She described primarily right-sided abdominal pain with subjective fever and occasional loose stools. Physical examination was remarkable for fever and tenderness to palpation in the right upper and lower quadrants with accompanying peritoneal signs. A complete blood cell count revealed an elevated white blood cell count of 89.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L with absolute neutrophil count of 23.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, hemoglobin value of 7.3 g/dL, and platelet count of 142 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Myelomonocytic blasts were present on the peripheral smear. Abdominal computed tomography revealed pericolonic stranding and mucosal thickening involving the cecum and proximal ascending colon. This presentation was consistent with typhlitis in the presence of underlying leukemia, confirmed as acute myelogenous leukemia French-American-British (FAB) type M4 on subsequent bone marrow biopsy.

She was given idarubicin, 12 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> , and cytosine arabinoside, 100 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> . On day 4 of induction, she developed right lower quadrant pain, fever, diarrhea, and tenesmus. The patient's absolute neutrophil count at that time was 0.6 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Repeated computed tomography of the abdomen revealed bowel wall thickening up to 1 cm involving the entire colon, consistent with a diagnosis of neutropenic enterocolitis. The patient was treated supportively with bowel rest, broad-spectrum antibiotics, hydration, and parenteral nutrition. After 15 days, the patient's neutropenia and abdominal pain resolved. Stool and blood cultures were negative during the period of neutropenia.\n\n【11】This patient's presentation is intriguing because the original typhlitis was likely related both to the leukemia and an infectious process. This theory is supported by the patient's resolution of symptoms with supportive care and antibiotics. These factors leading to colitis were then likely unmasked and exacerbated by the resultant immunosup-pression and additive effects of the chemotherapy on a likely altered bowel mucosa. Hogan et al proposed that the etiology of observed enterocolitis is likely related to toxic effects secondary to idarubicin and cytosine arabinoside therapy or an undiagnosed infectious process. One could argue that in our case the cause was multifactorial with an infectious component (treated initially with antibiotics and supportive care) that later progressed because of additive toxic chemotherapeutic effects and immunosuppression.

Therefore, to investigate whether female endogenous estrogen exposure amount is associated with decreased renal function, the relationship between RLD and CKD was analyzed in postmenopausal women using a population-based cohort.\n\n【101】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【102】The present study obtained data from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), a population-based cohort study constructed from May 1, 2001, through December 25, 2017. The detailed profile and methods concerning the development of KoGES have been described previously.\n\n【103】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【104】KoGES group  \nCohort profile: the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) Consortium \\[published erratum for Cohort Profile: The Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES) Consortium. _Int J Epidemiol_ . 2017\\].\n\n【105】KoGES is composed of 2 geographically distinctive cohorts, the KoGES\\_health examinee (HEXA) cohort and the KoGES\\_Ansan-Ansung cohort. The KoGES\\_HEXA cohort consists of participants residing in 14 metropolitan cities in Korea. The KoGES\\_Ansan-Ansung cohort includes participants from a medium-sized city (Ansan) and a rural area (Ansung) in Korea. Baseline data from the KoGES\\_HEXA cohort were used for the cross-sectional analysis. For the longitudinal analysis, the KoGES\\_Ansan-Ansung cohort was used. A total of 173,343 participants from the KoGES\\_HEXA cohort and 10,030 participants from the KoGES\\_Ansan-Ansung cohort were initially screened.\n\n【106】For this study, males, those older than 65 years, and those who were premenopausal or did not offer information about their menarche and menopausal ages were excluded. Additionally, women who had premature menopause, defined as those in whom menopause occurred at younger than than 40 years, were also excluded because these cases were more likely to involve a recall error or nonphysiologic condition such as an underlying endocrinologic problem. A total of 50,338 women from the KoGES\\_HEXA cohort were included in the final cross-sectional analyses . Participants in the KoGES\\_Ansan-Ansung study went through a series of health checks and surveys biannually from 2001 to 2014. Excluding participants with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> and without follow-up creatinine data, 3155 women were analyzed for the longitudinal analysis.\n\n【107】Figure 1 Flow diagram of the study. <sup>a </sup> Participants were categorized into 4 groups according to reproductive life span duration quartile. eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; KoGES = Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study; KoGES\\_Ansan-Ansung = Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study with participants from a medium-sized city (Ansan) and a rural area (Ansung) in Korea; KoGES\\_HEXA = Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study\\_Health Examinee.\n\n【108】All participants were enrolled in the study voluntarily, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki principles and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Yonsei University Health System Clinical Trial Center (4-2019-0858).\n\n【109】### Anthropometric and Laboratory Data\n\n【110】All participants underwent a comprehensive health examination with laboratory tests and completed surveys concerning their lifestyle and health status at study entry. Menstrual status, age at menarche, and age at menopause were also surveyed. Biochemical data were determined using fasting blood samples. Proteinuria was present if results of the urine dipstick test were higher than the 1+ level. Serum creatinine level was measured using the Jaffé assay. Creatinine levels were reduced by a calibration factor of 5% for standardization to isotope-dilution mass spectrometry reference method values.\n\n【111】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【112】Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium  \nComparison of risk prediction using the CKD-EPI equation and the MDRD study equation for estimated glomerular filtration rate.\n\n【113】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【114】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【115】Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration  \nExpressing the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation for estimating glomerular filtration rate with standardized serum creatinine values.\n\n【116】The eGFR was calculated using the Korean version of the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration equation.\n\n【117】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【118】Development and validation of the Korean version of CKD-EPI equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate.\n\n【119】For detailed methods, see Supplemental Methods .\n\n【120】### Measurement of the RLD\n\n【121】Participants were regarded as postmenopausal when menstrual bleeding was not noted for at least 12 months, and age at menopause was defined as the age at the time of the last menstrual period. The RLD was calculated by subtracting the age at menarche from the age at menopause. Study participants were stratified into quartiles according to their RLD for analysis.\n\n【122】### Definition of CKD\n\n【123】The presence of CKD was determined by definitions using eGFR only, as well as criteria considering both eGFR and proteinuria. CKD based on eGFR only was defined as eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . CKD based on eGFR and proteinuria was defined as eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> and/or the presence of proteinuria with protein excretion of 1+ or higher according to the urine dipstick test. For the cross-sectional analysis, only 1 measurement of eGFR and proteinuria was used. The longitudinal analysis used at least 2 consecutive results to define CKD. The CKD development time point was defined as the time when the second consecutive assessment met the CKD definition criteria.\n\n【124】### Statistical Analyses\n\n【125】All statistical analyses were performed using the Stata, version 15.1 for Windows, software program (StataCorp LLC). Continuous variables are expressed as mean ± SD, and categorical variables, as absolute numbers with percentages, respectively. Comparisons between groups were performed using Student _t_ test or analysis of variance for continuous variables and χ <sup>2 </sup> test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to determine the normality of the distribution of the parameters. If the resulting data did not show a normal distribution, median and interquartile range were reported; Mann-Whitney _U_ test or Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparing the groups.\n\n【126】Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the independent relationship of RLD with CKD in the cross-sectional analysis. Restricted cubic spline curves were depicted for logistic regression models. Each of the 5 knots was placed at the 5th, 27.5th, 50th, 72.5th, and 95th percentiles of RLD, according to the recommended percentiles of Harrell.\n\n【127】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【128】Regression Modeling Strategies: With Applications to Linear Models, Logistic and Ordinal Regression, and Survival Analysis.\n\n【129】Springer , Cham, Switzerland 2015\n\n【130】The reference point of RLD was 30 years, which was the median RLD of quartile 1. Each 1 percentile of upper and lower RLD was eliminated to reduce distortion. Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed to determine the independent relationship of RLD with incident CKD development. Cumulative kidney survival rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Multivariable models were constructed for adjusting confounding factors. Variables that showed statistical significance ( _P_ <.05) in univariate analysis or have clinical significance were included in multivariable models. For all analyses, _P_ <.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\n\n【131】Results\n-------\n\n【132】### Baseline Characteristics\n\n【133】Baseline characteristics of the postmenopausal women included in the cross-sectional analysis are described in Table 1 . Mean ± SD age and RLD of participants were 56.3±4.9 and 34.2±4.0 years, respectively. Additionally, mean ± SD eGFR was 93.1±13.6 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> .\n\n【134】Table 1 Baseline Characteristics of Postmenopausal Participants Included in the Cross-Sectional Analysis Cohort\n\n【135】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【136】eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; Q = quartile.\n\n【137】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【138】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【139】SI conversion factors: To convert cholesterol values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259; to convert triglyceride values to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0113; to convert albumin values to g/L, multiply by 10.\n\n| Variables | Total (N=50,338) | Quartiles of Reproductive Lifespan Duration (y) | _P_ |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Q1; 15-32 (n=15,171) | Q2; 33-35 (n=14,950) | Q3; 36-37 (n=9877) | Q4; 38-50 (n=10,340) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Demographic data |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Reproductive life span duration (y), mean ± SD | 34.2±4.0 | 29.5±2.4 | 34.1±0.8 | 36.5±0.5 | 39.4±1.5 |  |\n| Reason of menopause, no.

Mean age tended to be increased in women with longer RLDs ( _P_ <.001). In the shortest RLD quartile, more participants experienced menopause due to causes other than aging, including especially due to surgery ( _P_ <.001). Comorbid conditions such as hypertension ( _P_ <.001) and diabetes mellitus ( _P_ <.001) were more frequent in the longest RLD quartile. Mean eGFR ( _P_ <.001), mean glycated hemoglobin ( _P_ <0.001), total cholesterol ( _P_ <.001), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( _P_ \\=.004), and triglyceride levels ( _P_ <.001) were statistically significantly different among the quartiles, but differences were not large. Both past and current use of postmenopausal hormone therapy were more frequent in quartiles with shorter RLDs ( _P_ <.001). The pairwise comparison results between the groups are presented in Supplemental Table 1 .\n\n【145】### Prevalence of CKD\n\n【146】With respect to each RLD quartile, CKD based on eGFR only was found in 263 of 15,171 (1.73%), 218 of 14,950 (1.46%), 118 of 9877 (1.19%), and 166 of 10,340 (1.60%) participants , respectively. Women with CKD based on the eGFR and proteinuria definition numbered 574 of 15,171 (3.78%), 500 of 14,950 (3.34%), 319 of 9877 (3.23%), and 342 of 10,340 (3.31%), respectively. The adjusted rate of CKD prevalence tended to decrease in quartiles with longer RLDs .\n\n【147】### Association of RLD With CKD Prevalence\n\n【148】Logistic regression models revealed that the odds ratios (ORs) of CKD based on eGFR only were lower in the third (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.49-0.82) and fourth (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53-0.84) RLD quartiles vs the quartile with the shortest RLD after adjustments were made for confounding factors. In addition, when RLD was considered as a continuous variable, the OR of CKD was significantly decreased with longer RLD values (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82-0.97).

Adjustments were made for age, number of children, history of hypertension, history of diabetes mellitus, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, triglyceride level, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, levels of education and income, and history of smoking. A reference point was created at 30 years of RLD, which was the median RLD of the shortest RLD quartile.\n\n【160】The relationship between RLD and prevalent CKD was further explored in a series of sensitivity analyses that yielded results consistent with those of the main analyses .\n\n【161】### Association of RLD With Incident CKD Development\n\n【162】To further validate the association between kidney function and RLD, the risk of RLD on incident CKD development was evaluated in a longitudinal analysis. Baseline characteristics of the longitudinal analysis cohort are shown in Supplemental Table 5 .\n\n【163】During a mean follow-up of 9.7 years, incident CKD based on eGFR only and eGFR and proteinuria occurred in 221 (7.00%) and 234 (7.42%) of 3155 participants, respectively. The corresponding incident rates of CKD for each RLD quartile were 9.5, 7.6, 5.2, and 4.9 per 1000 person-years, based on the eGFR only definition. According to the eGFR and proteinuria definition, incident rates of CKD for the RLD quartiles were 10.3, 7.9, 5.2, and 5.5 per 1000 person-years, respectively.\n\n【164】When Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was performed, the risk for incident CKD development was significantly lower in those in the third (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.96) and fourth (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.74) RLD quartiles compared with those in the shortest RLD quartile. Similar findings were also observed when CKD was defined based on eGFR and proteinuria criteria . Kaplan-Meier curves showed that time to development of incident CKD was significantly longer in those with longer RLDs compared with the group with the shortest RLD . The association between RLD and incident CKD development was further evaluated in a series of sensitivity analyses that showed results consistent with those of the main analyses .\n\n【165】Table 3 Cox Proportional Hazard Model of the Association Between RLD and Incident CKD Development\n\n【166】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【167】CKD = chronic kidney disease; eGFR = estimated glomerular filtration rate; HR = hazard ratio; KoGES = Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study; Q = quartile; RLD = reproductive life span duration.\n\n【168】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【169】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【170】N=3,155.

Q = quartile.\n\n【176】Discussion\n----------\n\n【177】In this study, the relationship between RLD and CKD was investigated in a population-based cohort of postmenopausal women. The odds for prevalent CKD and risk for incident CKD development were lower in women with longer RLDs than in those with the shortest RLDs. These relationships were significant even after adjustments for confounding factors, including lifestyle factors and comorbid conditions that affect renal function. These findings suggest that longer exposure to endogenous estrogen, which would correlate with a shorter duration of estrogen deficiency, may be associated with a lower possibility of kidney damage.\n\n【178】Previous investigations have shown that iatrogenic changes made to estrogen exposure amounts could affect kidney function. A recent cohort study of women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy before the onset of menopause revealed that the risk for incident CKD was higher vs in an age-matched group that did not undergo oophorectomy, suggesting that the premature depletion of endogenous estrogen due to surgical procedures could accelerate the deterioration in kidney function.\n\n【179】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【180】CKD in patients with bilateral oophorectomy.\n\n【181】However, observational studies evaluating the effect of hormone therapy on kidney function have shown conflicting results. A 5-year follow-up of postmenopausal women reported that those who received hormone therapy were at lower risk for developing albuminuria.\n\n【182】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【183】The relationship between albuminuria and hormone therapy in postmenopausal women.\n\n【184】However, a different study of 5845 women indicated that hormone therapy was associated with a greater decline in eGFR during a 2-year study period.\n\n【185】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【186】Alberta Kidney Disease Network  \nOral estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women is associated with loss of kidney function.\n\n【187】These inconsistent results could be because these previous studies did not take into account the amount of endogenous estrogen exposure. In addition, estrogen may have different effects depending on its types (endogenous/exogenous) and the consequence of estrogen exposure may also vary regarding to the site of action in the kidney.\n\n【188】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【189】Sex hormones in women with kidney disease.\n\n【190】The results of the present study propose that lifetime endogenous estrogen exposure amount, represented by RLD, may be a significant factor affecting kidney function. Evaluations excluding the possibilities of external factors that could affect estrogen exposure amount, such as surgery-related menopause and hormone therapy history, also revealed a clear association, further suggesting a significant role of endogenous estrogen exposure amount on kidney function.\n\n【191】Although the contribution of sex to disease progression has been repeatedly observed in various types of renal diseases, the precise mechanisms have not been fully understood. Although some studies have suspected direct effects of sex hormones, others have proposed factors associated with sex differences, such as lifestyle.\n\n【192】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【193】Gender and the prevalence and progression of renal disease.\n\n【194】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【195】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【196】The influence of gender and sexual hormones on incidence and outcome of chronic kidney disease.\n\n【197】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【198】<sup><a>30</a></sup>\n\n【199】Chronic kidney disease and the involvement of estrogen hormones in its pathogenesis and progression.\n\n【200】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【201】<sup><a>31</a></sup>\n\n【202】Identification of modifiable chronic kidney disease risk factors by gender in an African-American metabolic syndrome cohort.\n\n【203】Previous clinical studies comparing renal outcomes between men and women could not fully dissect the effects of these sex-related lifestyle factors from hormonal effects. This is because most potential lifestyle factors that could affect renal function vary widely between sexes. Commonly, the amounts of calories and protein consumed differ between men and women.\n\n【204】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【205】In addition, smoking is more common among men than among women in certain cultural regions.\n\n【206】<sup><a>33</a></sup>\n\n【207】Variation in nicotine intake among U.S. cigarette smokers during the past 25 years: evidence from NHANES surveys.\n\n【208】In this study, by evaluating the effect of lifetime endogenous estrogen exposure in women, the influence of sex-related lifestyle factors could be somewhat excluded. In addition, extensive adjustments, which included lifestyle factors such as smoking history and socioeconomic factors, further support the possibility of estrogen playing a protective role against renal disease development. Some animal studies investigating the mechanism of sex differences in renal disease development have also suggested the presence of testosterone rather than the absence of estrogen to be the main cause of this sex dimorphism.\n\n【209】<sup><a>34</a></sup>\n\n【210】Gender-specific effects of endogenous testosterone: female alpha-estrogen receptor-deficient C57Bl/6J mice develop glomerulosclerosis.\n\n【211】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【212】<sup><a>35</a></sup>\n\n【213】Testosterone exacerbates obstructive renal injury by stimulating TNF-alpha production and increasing proapoptotic and profibrotic signaling.\n\n【214】The results of this study propose that even without the effects of testosterone, less lifetime estrogen exposure could have an influence on renal function.\n\n【215】Several molecular mechanisms could be considered as explanations for the reduction in the prevalent CKD risk found in women with longer RLDs. Recent investigations have reported that the receptors for estrogen are found not only in reproductive organs but also in other solid organs, such as the brain, liver, and kidneys, suggesting a direct effect of estrogen acting as a ligand.\n\n【216】<sup><a>36</a></sup>\n\n【217】The estrogen receptors: an overview from different perspectives.\n\n【218】Activation of the estrogen receptor α in the renal vasculature was found to activate nitric oxide synthase through a phosphoinositide 3 kinase–Akt–dependent pathway.\n\n【219】<sup><a>37</a></sup>\n\n【220】Estrogen induces nitric oxide production via nitric oxide synthase activation in endothelial cells.\n\n【221】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【222】<sup><a>38</a></sup>\n\n【223】Membrane estrogen receptor engagement activates endothelial nitric oxide synthase via the PI3-kinase-Akt pathway in human endothelial cells.\n\n【224】In addition, activation of the estrogen receptor β was found to attenuate the inflammatory responses induced by tumor necrosis factor α in vascular smooth muscle cells.\n\n【225】<sup><a>39</a></sup>\n\n【226】Estrogen modulates TNF-alpha-induced inflammatory responses in rat aortic smooth muscle cells through estrogen receptor-beta activation.\n\n【227】Direct effects on glomerular cells have also been suggested. In an animal experiment with cultured rat mesangial cells, treatment with 17 β-estradiol inhibited mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis.\n\n【228】<sup><a>40</a></sup>\n\n【229】Effects of sex hormones on mesangial cell proliferation and collagen synthesis.\n\n【230】In addition, in podocytes, treatment with 17 β-estradiol decreased transforming growth factor β expression and increased the estrogen receptor subtype β, suggesting that estrogen may provide protective effects by directly acting on renal cells.\n\n【231】<sup><a>41</a></sup>\n\n【232】17 Beta-estradiol and tamoxifen upregulate estrogen receptor beta expression and control podocyte signaling pathways in a model of type 2 diabetes.\n\n【233】Another possibility is the possible contribution of estrogen-induced epigenetic changes. A recent study showed that 17 β-estradiol attenuates angiotensin II–induced H3 acetylation in the aorta and investigations proving the involvement of microRNAs in estrogen-related vascular biology support the probability of epigenetic changes playing a role.\n\n【234】<sup><a>42</a></sup>\n\n【235】17-β Oestradiol prevents cardiovascular dysfunction in post-menopausal metabolic syndrome by affecting SIRT1/AMPK/H3 acetylation.\n\n【236】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【237】<sup><a>43</a></sup>\n\n【238】Estrogen receptor-mediated regulation of microRNA inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells.\n\n【239】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【240】<sup><a>44</a></sup>\n\n【241】miRNA as a new regulatory mechanism of estrogen vascular action.\n\n【242】Moreover, because shorter RLDs are linked with longer durations of estrogen deficiency, the findings of the study may suggest a harmful effect of estrogen deficiency rather than a protective role of estrogen. Further evaluations would be needed to elucidate clearly whether these possibilities have significant biomolecular applications.\n\n【243】This study has several limitations. First, because ages at menarche and menopause relied on self-reporting, there is a possibility that the ages given for these events could be inaccurate. However, studies have shown that the recall of menarche is generally well reported, showing that 80% to 90% of women accurately recall their age at menarche, with an error range within a year.\n\n【244】<sup><a>45</a></sup>\n\n【245】The reproducibility of self-reported age at menarche: the Tromso Study.\n\n【246】In addition, previous studies have reported self-reporting of menopause to be in satisfactory agreement with gynecology medical reports.\n\n【247】<sup><a>46</a></sup>\n\n【248】A validation study on status and age of natural menopause reported in the E3N cohort.\n\n【249】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【250】<sup><a>47</a></sup>\n\n【251】Validity and reproducibility of self-reported age at menopause in women participating in the DOM-project.\n\n【252】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【253】<sup><a>48</a></sup>\n\n【254】Reproducibility and validity of self-reported menopausal status in a prospective cohort study.\n\n【255】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【256】<sup><a>49</a></sup>\n\n【257】Age at menarche in a Korean population: secular trends and influencing factors.\n\n【258】Nonetheless, the possibility of recall bias should be recognized.\n\n【259】Second, an inverse causal-effect relationship between RLD and CKD could be probable in the cross-sectional analysis. As suggested by Cheung et al,\n\n【260】<sup><a>50</a></sup>\n\n【261】Menopausal symptoms in women with chronic kidney disease.\n\n【262】even slight decreases in eGFR may be capable of inducing early menopause. However, results of the longitudinal analysis showing that RLD has an effect on incident CKD development among women with normal kidney function strengthens the probability of a causal association.\n\n【263】Third, using only single measurements of eGFR and proteinuria in the cross-sectional analyses to define CKD would also be a limitation. Further evaluations more accurately discerning CKD would be necessary. Last, medication histories that could affect renal function, such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockage, diuretics, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, were unobtainable. Investigations taking these factors into consideration would be needed.\n\n【264】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【265】The CKD prevalence and incidence were significantly associated with RLD. Assuming that RLD is closely correlated with the total amount of endogenous estrogen exposure, the results indicate that the amount of endogenous estrogen exposure is closely associated with CKD risk in postmenopausal women. Further investigations are needed to understand the pathophysiologic mechanism of this phenomenon fully.\n\n【266】Acknowledgements\n----------------\n\n【267】The epidemiologic data used in this study were obtained from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (4851–302) of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Republic of Korea.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

They may also have an increased risk of testicular cancer (SIR, 5.09; 95% CI, 0.62-18.38; _P_ \\=.06) and prostate cancer (SIR, 2.21; 95% CI, 0.95-4.35; _P_ \\=.05). The estimated cumulative risks at age 50 years were 1.72% (95% CI, 0.64%-4.55%) for thyroid cancer and 1.00% (95% CI, 0.25%-3.92%) for choroidal melanoma. There was no statistical evidence of an increased risk of brain, breast, colorectal, lung, renal, bladder, endometrial, or ovarian cancer; lymphoma; leukemia; or multiple myeloma.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Patients with myotonic dystrophy may have an increased risk of thyroid cancer and choroidal melanoma and, possibly, testicular and prostate cancers.\n\n【9】Myotonic dystrophy (dystrophia myotonica) is initially a clinically defined disorder and is commonly characterized by myotonia, progressive muscle weakness, and onset of cataracts at a young age.\n\n【10】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【11】Myotonic Dystrophy.\n\n【12】2nd ed.

Pilomatricomas are the most commonly reported neoplasms. A variety of other neoplasms have been described, including thymoma; basal cell carcinomas; insulinomas; leukemia; lymphoma; spinal hemangioblastoma; maxillary jaw odontoma; adenomas of the parotid, parathyroid, thyroid, and pituitary glands; and cancers of the stomach, colon, testis, ovary, kidney, larynx, and thyroid. Tumors were first diagnosed, on average, in patients 44 years of age.\n\n【66】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【67】Hypothesis: neoplasms in myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【68】To our knowledge, risks of cancers in patients with myotonic dystrophy have not been quantified.\n\n【69】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【70】### Identification of Patients\n\n【71】The electronic medical records of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, from January 1, l993, through May 28, 2010, were text-word searched for the term _myotonic dystrophy_ , identifying 1687 unique medical records. The medical records were then abstracted individually to confirm a diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy. A total of 307 patients had a confirmed diagnosis based on (1) a positive genetic test result in that individual (expansion mutation within _DMPK_ or _CNBP_ ), (2) a positive gene test result in a blood relative plus a clinical picture of myotonic dystrophy in the patient even if a gene test was not performed, or (3) a clinical diagnosis alone established by consultation with a neurologist plus relevant laboratory findings. We were not able to determine from this chart review how many unique families were represented by these 307 patients. Most patients had a comprehensive consultation in one or more departments, and all patients completed a medical history intake form. This study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board, and patients gave consent for use of their medical records for research.\n\n【72】### Statistical Analyses\n\n【73】Observation time for each patient started at birth and ended at the age at first diagnosis of cancer or last contact or death, whichever occurred first. Cancer-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated by dividing the observed numbers of cancers by the expected numbers. Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by exact methods, assuming Poisson distribution of observed cases. The expected numbers of cancers were calculated by multiplying the age- and sex-specific incidence for the US general population with the corresponding observation time in the study cohort. We obtained age- and sex-specific US cancer incidences in 1998-2002 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 14 registries.\n\n【74】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【75】Curado M.P.

Kaplan-Meier failure function was used to estimate cumulative risk (penetrance) at ages 50 and 70 years. All reported statistical tests were 2-sided, and _P_ <.05 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 11.2 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).\n\n【77】Results\n-------\n\n【78】The study comprised 307 patients with myotonic dystrophy (54% female) who were identified from medical records of Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN, and were included regardless of cancer status or family history of cancer. Of all patients with myotonic dystrophy in this study, 118 were type 1 (74 were verified by genetic test in our records) and 86 were type 2 (45 were verified by genetic test in our records). The remainder of these groups were assigned on the basis of genetic tests conducted elsewhere and cited in the medical record or known to be positive in a blood relative. For 103 patients, no genetic testing was reported to have been done in the patient or in any affected relative, but the clinical diagnosis was well established .\n\n【79】TABLE 2 Baseline Characteristics of Patients With Myotonic Dystrophy (N=307)\n\n| Characteristic | No. (%) of patients |\n| --- | --- |\n| Sex |  |\n| Male | 142 (46) |\n| Female | 165 (54) |\n| Race |  |\n| White | 239 (78) |\n| Other | 5 (2) |\n| Unknown | 63 (21) |\n| Type of myotonic dystrophy |  |\n| 1 | 118 (38) |\n| 2 | 86 (28) |\n| Unknown | 103 (34) |\n| Diagnosis with electromyography |  |\n| Yes | 123 (40) |\n| No | 1 (<1) |\n| Unknown | 183 (60) |\n| Genetic testing |  |\n| Yes | 165 (54) |\n| No | 19 (6) |\n| Unknown | 123 (40) |\n| Cancer diagnosis |  |\n| At least 1 | 41 (13) |\n| Never | 266 (87) |\n| Age at last contact (y), mean (SD) | 49.3 (16.7) |\n| Age at symptom presentation (y), mean (SD) | 39.6 (15.0) |\n| Age at diagnosis for affected patients (y), mean (SD) | 54.7 (13.2) |\n\n【81】We observed a total of 53 cancers in 41 patients with myotonic dystrophy (15 type 1, 18 type 2, 8 unknown type) at a median age at diagnosis of 55 years (mean ± SD age, 54.7±13.2 years). Table 3 shows that a total of 5 thyroid cancers (3 papillary carcinomas, 1 medullary carcinoma, and 1 unknown for histology) were observed at median age at diagnosis of 42 years; this was an approximately 6-fold increased risk compared with the general population (SIR, 5.54; 95% CI, 1.80-12.93; _P_ \\=.001).

The estimated cumulative risk for choroidal melanoma was 1.00% (95% CI, 0.25%-3.92%) at age 50 years.\n\n【95】The incidence of testicular and prostate cancers was increased but did not reach statistical significance: testicular cancer SIR, 5.09, 95% CI, 0.62-18.38, _P_ \\=.06; and prostate cancer SIR, 2.21, 95% CI, 0.95-4.35, _P_ \\=.05. We also observed 9 nonmelanoma skin cancers (8 basal cell carcinomas and 1 squamous cell carcinoma) at median age at diagnosis of 57 years. Because there are no referent incidences of nonmelanoma skin cancers for the general population (eg, SEER data), we are unable to estimate SIR to state whether this is excessive. Of the nonmelanoma skin cancers, 3 were observed in patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and 6 in patients with type 2. There was no statistical evidence of an increased risk of brain, breast, colorectal, lung, renal, bladder, endometrial, or ovarian cancers; lymphoma; leukemia; or multiple myeloma .\n\n【96】Discussion\n----------\n\n【97】In this analysis of medical records of 307 individuals with myotonic dystrophy seen one or more times as patients at Mayo Clinic, we have demonstrated an increased risk of thyroid cancer and choroidal melanoma compared with the incidence of these tumors in the US general population. There was also a suggestion of increased risks for cancers of the prostate and testicles, although this did not reach statistical significance.\n\n【98】The association with an increased risk of thyroid cancer is novel and convincing. Endocrine dysfunction in myotonic dystrophy is known to commonly involve insulin insensitivity and primary gonadal failure in males, but the literature on thyroid problems in myotonic dystrophy is limited. In their review of all neoplasms reported in the literature in conjunction with myotonic dystrophy of both types, Mueller et al\n\n【99】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【100】Hypothesis: neoplasms in myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【101】encountered instances of colloid goiter, thyroid adenoma, medullary thyroid cancer, and thyroid cancers (type unknown) but were unable to state whether these observations exceed what is expected in such a population. Daumerie et al\n\n【102】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【103】High CTG repeat number in nodular thyroid tissue from a myotonic dystrophy patient.\n\n【104】reported studying the CTG repeat number in a benign thyroid nodule in a patient with type 1 myotonic dystrophy and found that the triplet expansion was 7 times larger than the expansion found in lymphocytes. Fukazawa et al\n\n【105】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【106】Thyroid function in patients with myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【107】investigated 12 patients with myotonic dystrophy for endocrine disturbances. All were euthyroid, but the free triiodothyronine level was somewhat lower than in controls, the mean maximal thyrotropin response was less than in controls, and radioiodine uptake was decreased. An earlier report by Steinbeck and Carter\n\n【108】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【109】Thyroid abnormalities in patients with myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【110】stated that 15% of their series of 20 young adults with myotonic dystrophy and 20% of cases described (20/102) before their report had palpable thyroid abnormalities. They also showed reduced thyrotropin response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone, despite euthyroid status as judged by circulating thyroid hormone level. Our study is the first to document statistically increased risks for thyroid cancers (papillary, medullary, and 1 unknown type), with estimated disease penetrance of about 4% by age 70 years. Careful annual palpation of the thyroid gland is indicated for adults with myotonic dystrophy, and imaging should be offered to those with any palpable abnormalities.\n\n【111】Choroidal melanomas were reported in this study, but because only 2 cases were observed, the CIs are wide and further validation of this observation will be important. We recommend that patients with myotonic dystrophy be offered an ophthalmologic evaluation annually in adulthood because of the known high incidence of cataracts in both type 1 and type 2 myotonic dystrophy, as well as this new possible association with choroidal melanoma.\n\n【112】We observed marginal evidence of increased risk for testicular cancer and prostate cancer, but further studies are needed to determine whether this result is of any significance. It is unclear how an increased risk for testicular cancer may be related to the well-documented risk for male infertility and hypogonadism in myotonic dystrophy, but one could speculate that there is a connection. In the meanwhile, health care providers for men with myotonic dystrophy may want to make a point of examining testicles annually and to implement prostate cancer screening by age 50 years.\n\n【113】In this study, we observed brain, breast, colorectal, lung, renal, bladder, endometrial, and ovarian cancers; cutaneous melanoma; lymphoma; leukemia; and multiple myeloma in patients with myotonic dystrophy. These cancers have also been reported in previous clinical and case reports. However, we did not observe statistical evidence of an increased risk of these cancers. Several studies have reported benign neoplasms observed in patients with myotonic dystrophy, especially pilomatricomas\n\n【114】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【115】Giant pilomatricoma and psoriasis vulgaris with myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【116】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【117】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【118】Multiple pilomatricomas: case presentation and review of the literature.\n\n【119】and thymoma,\n\n【120】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【121】An autopsy case of myotonic dystrophy with familial diabetes mellitus, a mixed tumor of the parotid gland and a thymoma.\n\n【122】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【123】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【124】Myotonic dystrophy and thymoma associated with myasthenic behavior on electromyography \\[in Spanish\\].\n\n【125】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【126】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【127】Myotonic dystrophy and thymoma.\n\n【128】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【129】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【130】Myotonic dystrophy and thymoma: a necropsy case report.\n\n【131】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【132】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【133】Multiple thymoma with myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【134】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【135】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【136】Thymoma and myotonic dystrophy: successful treatment with chemotherapy and radiation: case report and review of the literature.\n\n【137】but data on benign neoplasms were not available in our patients with myotonic dystrophy to quantify their risks.\n\n【138】Genetic mechanisms and underlying pathophysiology responsible for tumorigenesis in patients with myotonic dystrophy are not known. The CTG expansion in _DMPK_ and the CCTG expansion in _CNBP_ both occur in the noncoding portions of these genes: they are transcribed but apparently do not affect the protein-coding regions of those genes. The altered RNA is sequestered in the nucleus and has been documented to alter normal function of RNA splicing factors, which likely affect a large number of downstream targets. Research suggests that “the basic molecular mechanism is disruption of messenger RNA metabolism, which has far-reaching effects on many other genes.”\n\n【139】<sup><a>30</a></sup>\n\n【140】Clinical and molecular aspects of the myotonic dystrophies: a review.\n\n【141】On the basis of clinical and in vitro evidence, Mueller et al\n\n【142】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【143】Hypothesis: neoplasms in myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【144】developed a hypothesis regarding predisposition to neoplasms and for tumor progression in myotonic dystrophy that invokes the up-regulation of _β_ \\-catenin via the _Wnt_ signaling pathway and possibly via the actions of RNA splicing factors (eg, CUG-BP1, MBNL, and likely many others) that could affect many downstream genes. At present, it is safe to say that the mechanisms of dysfunction wrought by the disease-causing trinucleotide and tetranucleotide expansions in _DMPK_ and _CNBP_ are very poorly understood but merit further research.\n\n【145】This study was based on 53 cancers observed in a retrospective cohort of 307 patients with myotonic dystrophy. To our knowledge, it is the largest sample to date used to investigate cancer risks for patients with myotonic dystrophy and the first to attempt quantification of risks. This study had notable limitations: it was a retrospective chart review; the number of cases is too small to address more definitively many of the site-specific cancer risks; one-third of the cases could not be classified as type 1 or type 2 myotonic dystrophy; how many different families are represented by the 307 cases is unclear; environmental risk exposure histories on the cases are not available; and some cancers were self-reported.\n\n【146】We considered whether our ascertainment of the included patients may have skewed our results in some way. Of the 5 patients with thyroid cancer, only 1 was referred specifically for the expertise offered at Mayo Clinic for thyroid cancer. The others were diagnosed with cancer years before or after coming to Mayo Clinic. The 2 patients with choroidal melanoma were both referred to the Ophthalmology Department at Mayo Clinic because of their choroidal lesions and therefore may not be fully representative of patients with myotonic dystrophy in the community setting. However, we did not ascertain myotonic dystrophy on the basis of a diagnosis of cancer or a family history of cancer, and therefore the estimates from this study are less likely to be inflated because of ascertainment bias.\n\n【147】<sup><a>31</a></sup>\n\n【148】Estimates of familial risks from family data are biased when ascertainment of families is not independent of family history.\n\n【149】We fully acknowledge how ideal it would be to have a larger population-based case series with prospectively collected data.\n\n【150】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【151】Patients with myotonic dystrophy may have an increased risk of thyroid cancer and choroidal melanoma and may also have an increased risk of prostate and testicular cancers. Perhaps this study will prompt development of a properly designed multicenter study that can capture this information prospectively on a larger number of cases of myotonic dystrophy.\n\n【152】Addendum\n--------\n\n【153】After completing our research, and after our manuscript was accepted for publication in this journal, we learned that Gadalla et al\n\n【154】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【155】Cancer risk among patients with myotonic muscular dystrophy.\n\n【156】have also reported an association between myotonic muscular dystrophy and cancer risks.

This article serves to commemorate those before us, ensuring that the details of this formative time are not forgotten. It also celebrates more than 150 years of otology, rhinology, and laryngology practice at Mayo Clinic. This report was compiled from multiple sources including the annual reports to the Mayo Clinic Board of Governors, the _Mayovox_ (Mayo Voice) newsletter, the illustration archives of the Mayo Clinic Division of Creative Media, staff biographies, curriculum vitae, memoirs, personal interviews, full-text journal articles, and book publications including _The Doctors Mayo_ , _Mayo Roots: Profiling the Origins of Mayo Clinic_ , _Early Days in the Mayo Clinic_ , and _Sketch of the History of the Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Foundation_ . The core information for this report was abstracted from the annual report documents submitted to the Mayo Clinic Board of Governors every year by the section or department chair that detailed routine departmental business and any notable activities from the preceding year. The article is organized into 4 distinct historical eras: (1) the early years, (2) the establishment of the specialty, (3) adversity, transformation, and expansion, and (4) the modern era.\n\n【3】### The Early Years\n\n【4】As with all specialties at Mayo Clinic, the genealogy of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology begins with Dr William Worrall Mayo. Dr W.W. Mayo immigrated to the United States from England in 1845, and received his medical training in La Porte, Indiana, and St. Louis, Missouri. Shortly after beginning his medical practice, Dr W.W. Mayo contracted malaria and elected to leave Lafayette, Indiana, and traveled to Minnesota in 1856 in search of a more healthful climate. Dr W. W. Mayo and his family journeyed to several cities in Minnesota before ultimately settling in Rochester after Dr Mayo was appointed by President Abraham Lincoln to serve as the examining physician for draftees in southern Minnesota during the Civil War. During these years, his 2 sons were born—“Will” on June 29, 1861, and “Charlie” on July 19, 1865. Even early on, Dr W. W. Mayo involved his sons in the care of his patients; they would frequently attend country rounds and were sometimes permitted to observe “kitchen table operations” at the Carpenter House or participate in autopsies .\n\n【5】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【6】Early Days in the Mayo Clinic.\n\n【7】Charles C. Thomas , Springfield, IL 1969\n\n【8】These early decisive experiences led the brothers to pursue formal surgical training and return to Rochester to join their father's practice—Dr William James Mayo after obtaining his medical degree in 1883 from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and Dr Charles Horace Mayo after receiving his medical doctorate at Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, in 1888. Notably, Dr W. J. Mayo received much of his training in Michigan under Dr George E. Frothingham, Professor of Ophthalmology and Otology.\n\n【9】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【10】Mayo Clinic  \nSketch of the History of the Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Foundation.\n\n【11】WB Saunders Co , Philadelphia, PA 1926\n\n【12】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【13】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【14】Mayo Historical Unit.

Mayo traveled to Europe for 6 months, where he spent much of his time observing treatment of eye, ear, nose, and throat conditions, and he assumed responsibility for most of this work after returning to Rochester.\n\n【16】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【17】Mayo Historical Unit.

In 1864, Dr Joseph Lister, disheartened by the formidable rate of infection and the constant stench of hospital wards, began using carbolic acid (phenol) as an antiseptic in solutions for hand washing, instrument cleaning, dressing application, and even steam spray atomization.\n\n【21】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【22】On the effects of the antiseptic system of treatment upon the salubrity of a surgical hospital.\n\n【23】It was also at this time that several signficant surgical advances in the field of head and neck surgery were made, including Dr Emil Theodor Kocher's goiter excision in 1872, Dr Christian Albert Theodor Billroth's first description of total laryngectomy in 1873, Dr William S. Halsted's beginning use of cocaine as a topical vasoconstrictant and anesthetic in 1885, and the introduction of rubber gloves in 1889.\n\n【24】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【25】Mayo Historical Unit.

In Dr W. W. Mayo's seventh bibliography entry of 13 publications, he reports on the surgical management of a lingual epithelioma, a carcinoma of the tongue, in the 1885 _Transactions of the Minnesota State Medical Society_ .\n\n【37】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【38】Lingual epithelioma.\n\n【39】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【40】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【41】Mayo Clinic  \nPhysicians of the Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Foundation.\n\n【42】The University of Minnesota Press , Minneapolis, MN 1937\n\n【43】In this report, the patient was placed in a reclined position, a chloroform anesthetic was administered, the tumor was resected using a “dulled scissors” and a “sharp scoop,” and the area was subsequently cauterized with a hot iron.\n\n【44】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【45】Lingual epithelioma.\n\n【46】Central to the history of the Mayo Clinic and the establishment of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology was the construction of Saint Marys Hospital after a series of tornados devastated the local region in August 1883.\n\n【47】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【48】Early Days in the Mayo Clinic.\n\n【49】Charles C.

H. Mayo put it best, “The definition of a specialist as one who ‘knows more and more about less and less’ is good and true.

H. Mayo was the first otorhinolaryngology specialist at the Mayo Clinic. In a 1905 publication, Dr C. H. Mayo remarked on the technical details of head and neck cancer surgery, an area at which he excelled, stating, “This is to me a most interesting region for surgical work.

The early sections at the Mayo Clinic that comprise the modern practice of otolaryngology–head and neck surgery included the sections of surgery, with treatment of thyroid and parathyroid disease and care of certain head and neck cancers ; the Section of Ophthalmology and Otology established in 1909 with Dr Carl Fisher as head, which primarily dealt with conditions of the eye; the Division of Medicine with Dr Henry Plummer and his interests in aerodigestive endoscopy; and the Section of Laryngology and Rhinology established in 1906, with Dr Justus Matthews serving as section head, which was subsequently divided in 1917 into the Section of Laryngology, Oral and Plastic Surgery and the Section of Otolaryngology and Rhinology .\n\n【169】Figure 11 Early surgical illustration depicting enucleation of a malignant tumor of the parotid gland in order to reduce the risk of facial paralysis.\n\n【170】Reproduced with permission of the W. Bruce Fye Center for the History of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.\n\n【171】Figure 12 Illustration of a surgical specimen with an infiltrating left vocal cord epithelioma, or squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【172】Reproduced with permission of the W. Bruce Fye Center for the History of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.\n\n【173】Given the fragmented, overlapping, and often shifting nature of many early surgical sections that comprise the modern practice of otolaryngology–head and neck surgery, the exact start date of the Mayo Clinic Department of Otorhinolaryngology initially may seem somewhat obscure. However, a careful review of publication history and surgical case logs of this time reveals that the official founding date of the department should be May 2, 1906, with the establishment of the Section of Laryngology and Rhinology. Subsequently, the department's history predominantly continues through the Section of Otolaryngology and Rhinology. Because the 1917 section transformation played a pivotal role in the history of the department, this transition is reviewed in greater detail. On April 1, 1917, 2 years after the official establishment of the Mayo School of Graduate Medical Education, Dr Harold I. Lillie joined Drs Matthews and New as a specialist in diseases of the nose and throat . Three months later, on July 1, 1917, the Section of Otolaryngology and Rhinology was established at Mayo Clinic, and Dr. H. I. Lillie was appointed chief, a position he held until October 1, 1951.\n\n【174】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【175】Mayo Clinic  \nSketch of the History of the Mayo Clinic and the Mayo Foundation.\n\n【176】WB Saunders Co , Philadelphia, PA 1926\n\n【177】The formal appointment of Dr H. I. Lillie to section head upset Dr Matthews, who resigned that same year. It is said that during this time, Dr New persuaded Dr H. I. Lillie to divest himself from several areas of the specialty to allow Dr New to form the separate section of Laryngology, Oral and Plastic Surgery (Thomas J. McDonald, MD, written communication, 2002). Dr New was originally an assistant to Dr Matthews in 1910 and had a background in dental surgery, head and neck trauma surgery, and ablative head and neck oncologic surgery. In contrast, during these years, most of Dr H. I. Lillie's time and interests involved the surgical treatment of suppurative disease and its related complications. He could not foresee the substantial changes to the field that would occur with the introduction of antibiotics, and thus this division of labor seemed both equitable and natural. Although not evident at the time, the departure of laryngology, oncologic surgery, and plastic surgery was a major strategic error on Dr H. I. Lillie's part because it set in motion major obstacles that the section would need to address more than 50 years later. Despite the seeming overlap of laryngology between the 2 sections, the appointments of 1917 stipulated that two-thirds of the laryngology cases go to the Section of Laryngology, Oral and Plastic Surgery and a third to the Section of Otolaryngology and Rhinology; however, in practice, laryngological surgery largely remained under the jurisdiction of the former.\n\n【178】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【179】Mayo Historical Unit.

Between 1913 and 1917, Dr H. I. Lillie worked as an instructor and assistant in otolaryngology at the University of Michigan Medical School and subsequently at Rush Medical College in Chicago. It was rumored that unfairness in referral apportion at his Chicago practice led him to search for other job opportunities, and the open land of Rochester was particularly appealing to him with his equestrian background.\n\n【202】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【203】Mayo Historical Unit.

It was believed that by removing the primary nidus, many chronic ailments could be prevented or cured. Numerous anatomic sites were implicated as common foci, but the oral cavity and pharynx were the most well recognized. As a result, tooth extraction and tonsillectomy were frequently performed even in the absence of local symptoms, leaving many patients edentulous . Influenced by Dr Edward C. Rosenow, who was recruited from Chicago to Mayo Clinic to assist in laboratory diagnostic testing and basic science research, Dr C. H. Mayo published in support of the focal infection theory.\n\n【233】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【234】Early Days in the Mayo Clinic.\n\n【235】Charles C.

Between 1920 and 1930, 2000 to 3000 tonsillectomies were performed annually, compared with fewer than 1000 in the 1930s after growing skepticism regarding the merits of this theory surfaced.\n\n【243】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【244】Mayo Historical Unit.

Although it is difficult to conceive today, in the preantibiotic era life-threatening intracranial complications including septic dural sinus thrombosis, meningitis, abscess, and empyema were common sources of severe morbidity and mortality and required surgical intervention to halt progression, often resulting in disfiguring defects. During this era, radical mastoidectomy and external approaches to the paranasal sinuses, such as the Lynch, Denker, or Caldwell-Luc procedures, were common .\n\n【248】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【249】Mayo Historical Unit.

The first time sulfanilamide and its derivatives were mentioned within the section's historical archives was in 1939. Subsequently, penicillin was first referenced in 1942 and streptomycin in 1945.\n\n【253】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【254】Mayo Historical Unit. MHU-0002: Board of Governors Records.

Purportedly, the first patient treated with penicillin in the Section of Otolaryngology and Rhinology was a terminally ill woman with severe leukopenia who had extensive cellulitis of the face.\n\n【259】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【260】Mayo Historical Unit.

In the 1930s, there was a marked transition to primary medical management of many cases of acute infection, and it was generally only cases of chronic infection that ultimately required surgical intervention.\n\n【262】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【263】Mayo Historical Unit.

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.\n\n【264】The success of antibiotic therapy permitted otolaryngologists to shift their focus from prevention and treatment of life-threatening infections to functional surgery and further advancements in pharmacological therapy. This trend was most evident in the early years of modern otology with the treatment of otosclerosis and Ménière's disease. At the turn of the 20th century, the practice of stapes footplate surgery was condemned given the risk of ascending meningitis and sensorineural hearing loss.\n\n【265】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【266】A personal history of stapedectomy.\n\n【267】As an alternative to stapes footplate mobilization, pioneering aural surgeons including Dr Julius Lempert in New York turned to labyrinthine fenestration for treatment of otosclerosis.\n\n【268】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【269】A personal history of stapedectomy.\n\n【270】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【271】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【272】Julius Lempert and the fenestration operation.\n\n【273】In 1943, Dr Henry L.

The momentum of success from advancing medical therapies even raised questions regarding the future need for oncologic surgery: “If some medicament is developed which will control cancer, general surgical procedures will likewise be reduced.

During this year, the Mayo brothers established the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research in association with the University of Minnesota, providing an initial endowment of $1.5 million dollars.\n\n【295】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【296】Early Days in the Mayo Clinic.\n\n【297】Charles C.

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.\n\n【332】This scenario paralleled the general popularity of Mayo Clinic as a whole. Early on, Mayo Clinic established itself as a premier center for surgical training. In the 1920s, more than 1000 candidates sought graduate training opportunities annually, and by the 1940s, nearly 10% of all graduate medical school trainees had completed their residency or fellowship at Mayo Clinic.\n\n【333】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【334】In 1928, it was noted, “The Mayo Clinic is looked upon by otolaryngologists as an excellent place for post-graduate work in the specialty. Many men of standing have suggested to younger men that they come here for their training.”\n\n【335】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【336】Mayo Historical Unit. MHU-0002: Board of Governors Records.

Lillie remarked that there were 15 applications for fellowship in the past year; however, only 3 could be accommodated.\n\n【338】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【339】Mayo Historical Unit.

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.\n\n【344】It was also during this time that many other training programs were becoming established and would commonly offer a combined eye, ear, nose, and throat experience, which was appealing to applicants who were pursuing community positions.\n\n【345】In earlier years, positions in Mayo's otolaryngology fellowship training program were highly sought because of the Clinic's early recognition of the importance of treating head and neck cancer and laryngological disorders. Despite a division of labor between sections, for over 20 years fellows of the Section of Otolaryngology and Rhinology at Mayo Clinic received training across several sections, including 1 year of training with the Section of Laryngology, Oral and Plastic Surgery. Under the leadership of Dr New, the latter had expanded to include several other notable figures including Dr Frederick A. Figi and Dr John B Erich, who both served as fellows in otolaryngology and rhinology before their appointment as staff in the Section of Laryngology, Oral and Plastic Surgery. However, as founding members of the American Board of Plastic Surgery, Drs New and Erich developed a separate fellowship program in plastic surgery at the Clinic. The establishment of this program resulted in less collaboration between training programs and a reduction in time and educational prospects in laryngology, head and neck cancer surgery and plastic surgery by the otolaryngology fellows.\n\n【346】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【347】Mayo Historical Unit.

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.\n\n【348】After several negotiations, temporary agreements occurred to improve training opportunities between the sections; however, these arrangements were largely ineffective because of the fundamental problem of specialty jurisdiction.\n\n【349】The timing of the change in the structure of the otolaryngology residency program was incredibly inopportune because other reputable training programs across the country were expanding to encompass skull base surgery, head and neck surgical oncology, maxillofacial trauma, and later, facial plastic and reconstructive surgery. As the specialty expanded, turf battles ensued at many institutions. Most academic centers recognized the expanding domain of otolaryngology–head and neck surgery and adapted to the growth; however, the Section of Otolaryngology and Rhinology at Mayo Clinic was slow to evolve (H. Bryan Neel III, MD, PhD, written communication, October 22, 2015).\n\n【350】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【351】Mayo Historical Unit. MHU 0670: General and Staff Memoir Collection. Box 13; Folder 243. W.

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.\n\n【355】Further, coinciding with growing internal pressures, the American Board of Otolaryngology placed additional requirements on education in the basic sciences and expanded clinical specialties. The state of affairs was summarized well by an internal publication drafted by the Section of Otolaryngology and Rhinology in 1949:\n\n【356】A decreasing number of suitable men are applying for training in ear, nose and throat. In discussing this situation with physicians conducting other similar teaching services it is the consensus that a serious situation may develop. More training services have been developed throughout the country because of the influence of the American Examination Board and thus has made available opportunities for training more men in the field. The decrease in incidence of surgical mastoiditis due to the effect of treatment of ear infection with sulfonamides and antibiotics has been a deterrent for physicians entering the field. Actually in the past the field was largely surgical. At present, patients present more medical problems than surgical. The work is not so spectacular but is even more important to the patients. In the future the outstanding men in the field will need to have broad general medical background training and the borderline surgical fields will be included in the scope of the specialty…. When the special surgical field is arbitrarily confined, by the desire and occasionally by the dictum of general surgeons, to structures within the mucocutaneous margin of the involved anatomic structures, it would seem at once too arbitrary and actually a very short-sighted and silly position to take. The same medical education and training are demanded of the special surgeon as of the general surgeon.\n\n【357】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【358】Mayo Historical Unit. MHU-0002: Board of Governors Records.

Dr Simonton saw to the development of a more organized curriculum, expanding beyond direct patient consultations to include formal education in anatomy, pathology, audiology, vestibular medicine, and endoscopy.\n\n【372】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【373】Mayo Historical Unit.

It was proposed that rhinoplasty and operative laryngological procedures be returned to the otolaryngology and rhinology section.\n\n【384】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【385】Mayo Historical Unit.

Similarly, a case was made that the Section of Laryngology, Oral and Plastic Surgery should be satisfied with the management of “neoplastic and plastic services” alone, and the field of laryngology surgery should be reallocated to the section of otolaryngology and rhinology under the supervision of Drs O. Erik Hallberg and John C. Lillie, who had general surgical training. The precedent for this change existed because the original division of sections in 1917 called for a minimum of a third of the laryngology cases to be managed by the ear, nose, and throat section.\n\n【387】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【388】Mayo Historical Unit.

Lillie and received his residency training at Mayo Clinic in the Section of Otolaryngology and Rhinology.\n\n【390】The period of great transformation and growth for the Section of Otolaryngology and Rhinology occurred under the chairmanship of Dr D. Thane R. Cody . Dr Cody received his Doctor of Medicine degree at Dalhousie University Faculty of Medicine in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, and accepted a fellowship position in surgery at the Mayo Foundation in 1958.\n\n【391】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【392】Mayo Historical Unit. MHU-0675: People Files Collection. Folder title: D. Thane Cody, MD. W. Bruce Fye Center for the History of Medicine.

MHU 0670: General and Staff Memoir Collection. Box 13; Folder 243. W. Bruce Fye Center for the History of Medicine.

Over time, Dr Cody earned a national reputation as an innovative otologic surgeon, prolific writer and presenter, and basic science researcher. Among many other topics, Dr Cody authored seminal work on the use of corticosteroids for sensorineural hearing loss; cortical audiometry; and concentrations of parenteral antibiotics in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and inner ear with implications for streptomycin ototoxicity.\n\n【397】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【398】Mayo Historical Unit.

The sharp tack prosthesis would then perform repeated decompression of the saccule during hydropic episodes.\n\n【400】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【401】The tack operation.\n\n【402】Figure 16 D.

Bruce Fye Center for the History of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.\n\n【404】Dr Cody was a servant of the department, institution, and specialty. Under his leadership, the Section of Otolaryngology and Rhinology graduated from a section to a department, the internal committees of education, clinical practice, and research were initiated, an obligatory 6-month or 1-year basic science laboratory term for fellows was begun, and the development of the chief year, as it is commonly known today, occurred in 1968.\n\n【405】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【406】Mayo Historical Unit.

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.\n\n【407】However, perhaps the greatest of Dr Cody's accomplishments remains unknown to most. When Dr Cody began as section chief in 1968, he received a letter from the American Board of Otolaryngology on January 10, 1968, stating that “on June 30, 1968, the Department will move from probation to a status where it would close down completely” (T. J. McDonald, MD, written communication, June 17, 2002). It seemed that for 5 years, the knowledge that the training program was under probation had never been shared by the previous section head of otolaryngology. Dr Cody called for an urgent meeting and received permission from the personnel committee to move several key staff from the Section of Laryngology, Oral Surgery and Plastic Surgery to the Section of Otolaryngology and Rhinology, including Dr Kenneth D. Devine and Dr J. C. Lillie. Interestingly, both Drs Devine and J. C. Lillie had already been certified by the American Board of Otolaryngology in the 1950s in order to legitimize their prior involvement in the training of otolaryngology fellows.\n\n【408】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【409】Mayo Historical Unit. MHU 0670: General and Staff Memoir Collection. Box 13; Folder 243. W. Bruce Fye Center for the History of Medicine.

J. McDonald, MD, written communication, June 17, 2002).\n\n【411】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【412】Mayo Historical Unit. MHU 0670: General and Staff Memoir Collection. Box 13; Folder 243. W.

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.\n\n【416】These advancements brought the residency training program and department out of a 20-year downturn and reinstituted the department's national reputation in research, education, and clinical care.\n\n【417】Notably, Dr DeSanto was the first otolaryngology resident who received further training outside Mayo Clinic in head and neck surgical oncology. Between 1966 and 1967, Dr DeSanto received additional experience in head and neck surgery at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\n【418】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【419】Mayo Historical Unit. MHU 0670: General and Staff Memoir Collection. Box 13; Folder 243. W. Bruce Fye Center for the History of Medicine. Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.\n\n【420】With his return to Mayo Clinic in 1968, he was the first physician in the department to perform neck dissections for treatment of head and neck cancer, and his practice was critically observed by some of his colleagues in general surgery. Dr DeSanto's perseverance and favorable clinical outcomes, combined with the existing practices of Drs Devine and Pearson, firmly established head and neck surgery as a major component of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology.\n\n【421】In 1982, Dr Neel succeeded Dr Cody as chair of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, serving until 1990. Dr Neel continued the momentum initiated by Dr Cody, further improving the reputation of the department and supporting advancement of the specialty at Mayo Clinic and nationally. Instrumental to negotiations regarding official acknowledgment of the expanding and capable head and neck surgical domain of the otolaryngologist at Mayo Clinic was a written report on head and neck surgery (unpublished data, 1988). This 27-page report, submitted to the members of the Board of Governors, sought to “finally end a long cycle of divisiveness among a few and lead to clear recognition that Otorhinolaryngology was the only department at Mayo which practiced the entire scope of head and neck surgery and indeed cared for the vast majority of patients in this specialty.” From this point forward, the department began to use the term _otolaryngology–head and neck surgery_ to more accurately portray the breadth of the specialty.\n\n【422】### The Modern Era\n\n【423】The modern era marks a period of stability and achievement for the Department of Otorhinolaryngology. Mayo Clinic, including the specialty of otorhinolaryngology, has expanded to incorporate campuses in Jacksonville, Florida, and Scottsdale, Arizona, in 1986 and 1987, respectively. Additionally, the Mayo Clinic Health System was initiated in 1992, a network of clinics and hospitals now serving more than 70 communities in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa. Most recently, Mayo Clinic was ranked first by the _U.S. News & World Report's_ Best Hospitals rating in 2016, and the department was ranked first in specialty in 2014. Never before has the Department of Otorhinolaryngology more fully realized accomplishments in the areas represented by the 3 shields of the Mayo Clinic—patient care, education, and research, as summarized below.\n\n【424】#### Patient Care, the First Shield\n\n【425】From a clinical practice perspective, the modern period is defined by the subspecialist. Historically, all resident graduates would start their career as a general otolaryngologist until interests and talents matured toward one particular area. In the 1980s, it was normal for a surgeon to perform stapedectomy, glossectomy with neck dissection, and rhinoplasty on any given operative day. Although there are exceptions to this practice, since 1998 nearly all hired staff in the department have received additional subspecialty training following a minimum of a 5-year general otolaryngology residency. The increasing volume of medical knowledge and technical skills required to care for patients with complex otolaryngological disease has led to the development of subspecialty training in areas including otology, neurotology and skull base surgery, head and neck surgical oncology, facial plastic and reconstructive surgery, rhinology, sinus and allergy, pediatric otolaryngology, laryngology, and sleep medicine and surgery. Even within the past 3 years, the department has seen a net growth of 6 subspecialty-trained surgeons in the fields of neurotology, head and neck oncologic surgery, pediatric otolaryngology, sinus surgery, and sleep surgery, as well as the addition of a medical geneticist specializing in head and neck and audiovestibular disorders. Although a comprehensive summary of the current clinical activity of the department is beyond the scope of this report, several notable highlights warrant mention, including the development and expansion of the cochlear implant program, the application of the da Vinci surgical system to augment minimally invasive transoral surgery, and the growth and expansion of endoscopic sinus and anterior skull base surgery.\n\n【426】<sup><a>31</a></sup>\n\n【427】Today the Department of Otorhinolaryngology enjoys a highly collaborative relationship among subspecialists within the department and among specialties. The introductory quote by Dr W. J. Mayo rings more true today than ever—the field of medicine and surgery has required increasing specialization, which in turn has required greater collaboration with other specialists to provide complete care to the patient. As an example, the multidisciplinary model of care is exemplified by the daily collaboration for treatment of complex skull base disorders seen among otolaryngology, neurosurgery, radiation oncology, medical oncology, neuroradiology, medical genetics, and speech pathology. Patients are evaluated in a multidisciplinary clinic according to their individual needs, and complex cases are presented at a regularly scheduled skull base tumor conference. The Mayo Clinic model of equal salary within a department is unique in contrast to an incentive-based practice, which is common nationally. Physicians are free to provide care without financial pressures, which fosters collaboration, reduces unnecessary procedures or tests, and ultimately benefits the patient.\n\n【428】#### Education, the Second Shield\n\n【429】For the past 30 years, the otolaryngology residency program has consistently held a competitive position, prized for early autonomy, high surgical volume, and broad case diversity. From more than 300 applicants, 32 candidates are offered interviews, and only 5 residents are selected each year. The Mayo Clinic residency program continues to follow the apprenticeship model, which remains unique among programs. Additionally, the 6 months of dedicated research time and semiautonomous chief year, originally established by Dr Cody, remain protected attributes of the program. Every year, graduates of the program secure positions in competitive fellowship training programs, with approximately half obtaining academic appointments following training. A fellowship in advanced head and neck oncologic surgery and microvascular reconstruction, initiated in July 2011, has attracted national and international candidates. Additionally, the department has applied for a fellowship program in neurotology and lateral skull base surgery, with an anticipated start date of July 2018.\n\n【430】#### Research, the Third Shield\n\n【431】The Department of Otorhinolaryngology remains active in basic science and clinical research, and a monthly research symposium is held to facilitate intradepartmental and interdepartmental collaboration. Areas of particular interest include regenerative medicine, whole-exome sequencing for biomarker discovery and analysis of genotype-phenotype correlations, and quality of life outcome analysis in skull base surgery, to name a few. Overall, departmental academic productivity remains high with approximately 100 articles published in peer-reviewed journals and an equal number of presentations at national and international conferences each year.\n\n【432】### Conclusion\n\n【433】In closing, it is fitting to review a timeless reflection by Dr C. H. Mayo, published in 1928 in the _Annals of Otology and Laryngology,_ in which he spoke of his place in medicine and the future of the profession: “How fortunate we have been who have lived during this great period of medical progress of say, 30 years, yet I have heard my father say the same, many years ago. The textbooks of the days of his youth, when the microscope was revealing only the most obvious things and before the germ theory of disease was put forward, show in a most startling way how false their ideas of disease were. Their clinical observations were often strikingly accurate, but sometimes unaccountably faulty…. Yet they called themselves modern and looked back at their predecessors with a patronizing sort of pity from the pinnacles of scientific success to which they had attained. In spite of the soundness of our present theories and the exacting proof to which all our beliefs are put, I cannot always be sure that a century from now somebody will not be saying the same sort of things about us. It may be that we are sojourning in the wilderness, that such discipline is necessary for the children of Medicine, and that we have not yet so much as seen the promised land…. I believe we are traveling the road to the elucidation of all disease, but the journey's end may be a long way off. Each day is a step, and there is always a milestone just around the corner; that is good enough”.\n\n【434】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【435】Medicine in retrospect.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Information obtained from these records and from the trauma database included patient demographics, mechanism of injury, injury patterns, medical care, and outcomes.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Forty-three patients were admitted to our hospital for snowmobile-related incidents. Snowmobile incidents occurred most commonly in male adolescents. The 2 most common mechanisms of injury were ejection and striking a stationary object. Twenty-seven (63%) of the patients drove the snowmobile. Only 23 patients (53%) wore a helmet. At presentation, the mean ± SEM Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 12.1±1.4. Orthopedic injuries predominated (n=42); however, abdominal (n=12) and head (n=8) injuries were also common. Four patients were intubated, and 15 required intensive care unit admission. Twenty-nine patients (67%) required surgical intervention. The mean ± SEM length of hospitalization was 6.7±1.4 days. No deaths occurred; however, 7 patients (16%) had long-term disabilities. A significant improvement occurred in both Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score and ISS for patients using a helmet. In addition, helmet use increased with age ( _P_ \\=.01). Days in the intensive care unit were proportional to both GCS score ( _r_ <sub>s </sub> \\=-0.47; _P_ \\=.002) and ISS ( _r_ <sub>s </sub> \\=0.6; _P_ <.001). Length of hospitalization also correlated with both GCS score ( _r_ <sub>s </sub> \\=-0.03; _P_ \\=.008) and ISS ( _r_ <sub>s </sub> \\=0.54; _P_ \\=.02).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Snowmobiles are a significant source of multitrauma for children. Orthopedic injuries predominate, especially in older children, and can lead to long-term disabilities.

In 2 recent communications that focused on short-term and long-term ruxolitinib treatment outcome, respectively, the drug was shown to be effective in controlling constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly but was also associated with important adverse effects, including moderate to severe thrombocytopenia and anemia. The most recent of the 2 communications focused on 51 Mayo Clinic patients who participated in the original phase 1/2 ruxolitinib clinical trial and highlighted a high treatment discontinuation rate (92% after a median time of 9.2 months), primarily for loss of treatment benefit but also because of drug-associated adverse effects. The report also discussed the occurrence of sometimes severe withdrawal symptoms during ruxolitinib treatment discontinuation. This “ruxolitinib withdrawal syndrome” was characterized by acute relapse of disease symptoms, accelerated splenomegaly, worsening of cytopenias, and occasional hemodynamic decompensation, including a septic shocklike syndrome. In the current sponsor-independent analysis, we describe the details of these events in 5 severely affected cases (11%) among 47 Mayo Clinic patients with MF in whom ruxolitinib therapy had been discontinued. Our experience calls for full disclosure of the ruxolitinib withdrawal syndrome to patients with MF before initiating ruxolitinib therapy, and treatment discontinuation must be done under close physician supervision and preferably in a tapering schedule.\n\n【1】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【2】DLT ( dose-limiting toxicity ), ET ( essential thrombocythemia ), MF ( myelofibrosis ), MPN ( myeloproliferative neoplasm ), MTD ( maximum tolerated dose ), PMF ( primary MF ), PV ( polycythemia vera )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Adenoviral vectors are most commonly used in cardiovascular gene delivery, but toxicity related to these vectors remains a concern. In addition, duration of gene expression with use of these vectors is limited, which may be advantageous in settings in which transient expression is satisfactory to obtain a therapeutic effect. Gene therapy has been suggested as an approach to multiple conditions, including restenosis after angioplasty, therapeutic neovascularization, and bypass graft restenosis. Phase 1 clinical trials were recently reported. While proof of principle has been established in preclinical animal models, convincing efficacy data in humans do not yet exist. Improvements in vector technology and methods of catheter . mediated vascular gene delivery are needed before widespread clinical application of this therapy.\n\n【1】LDL ( low-density lipoprotein ), VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

We compared STEMI and NSTEMI rates, management patterns, and in-hospital morbidity and mortality in men and women stratified into 4 age groups (<45, 45 to 64, 65 to 84, and ≥85 years of age).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 6,720,639 weighted hospitalizations for MI (79.8% NSTEMI, and 20.2% STEMI) were included. The incidence rate of hospitalizations for MI was lower in women than men across all age groups. Women were less likely than men to undergo coronary angiography, revascularization, or to use circulatory-support devices. These differences were consistent across all age groups. Adjusted odds of death for women (vs men) varied by age: odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 1.08 (0.97 to 1.20), 1.05 (1.02 to 1.08), 0.92 (0.91 to 0.94), and 0.86 (0.85 to 0.88) for NSTEMI, and 1.15 (1.04 to 1.27), 1.22 (1.18 to 1.26), 1.09 (1.06 to 1.11), and 0.97 (0.94 to 0.99), for STEMI, in age groups (<45, 45 to 64, 65 to 84, and ≥85), respectively. The magnitude of differences in complications between men and women was higher in younger and middle-age patients.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Compared with men, women have lower incidence of MI and less likelihood of undergoing invasive treatment regardless of age.

His father, Samuel, a teacher in the Linköping Gymnasium, died when his son was 4 years of age. His mother, Elizabeth, subsequently married the pastor of the Lutheran church in the town of Norrköping, so Jacob and his sister were raised together with the 5 children of their stepfather. Conflicts with his step-siblings resulted in Berzelius taking a position as a tutor on a nearby farm in 1794, where he developed an interest in collecting and classifying flowers and insects.\n\n【1】Berzelius matriculated at the University of Uppsala in 1796, where he studied medicine. One of his professors, Anders Gustaf Ekberg (1767-1813), was the discoverer of the element tantalum. Berzelius' stepbrother introduced him to chemistry, which he found stimulating; however, the chemistry faculty in Uppsala did not encourage young Berzelius. Subsequently, he began to carry out experiments in his own quarters. He had planned to live with his aunt while in Uppsala, but her husband was not supportive; so instead, Jacob worked as an apprentice in a pharmacy. Here he learned glassblowing and became familiar with various medications.\n\n【2】Given an unpaid assistantship with a physician who worked near the Medevi mineral springs, Berzelius began analyzing the mineral content of the spring water. He read about the newly described “voltaic pile” by Alessandro Volta, which was the first reliable source of an electric current. He then built his own voltaic pile with alternating zinc discs and copper coins. His doctoral thesis at Uppsala consisted of a study of the effect of galvanic current on patients with various diseases, which produced no benefit for the patients.\n\n【3】After obtaining his medical degree in 1802 from the University of Uppsala, he secured an appointment as an assistant to the Professor of Medicine and Pharmacy at the College of Medicine in Stockholm. This institution soon became the internationally known Karolinska Institut. The owner of the house in which he lived in Stockholm was a wealthy mine owner with an interest in mineralogy and chemistry. Together, he and Berzelius carried out many electrochemical studies on minerals.\n\n【4】Early in his career, Berzelius had financial problems because his positions came with a very low salary. However, after the Professor of Medicine and Pharmacy in Stockholm died in 1807, Berzelius was appointed to the post and had a much better salary and access to an excellent laboratory. As a result, he was able to spend most of his time performing chemistry experiments.\n\n【5】In 1808, he became a member of the Swedish Academy of Science and two years later became its president. He travelled abroad meeting the leading chemists of the day, including Humphry Davy (1778-1829) in London, as well as several prominent chemists in Germany. He subsequently spent a year in France where he worked with Claude Louis Berthollet (1748-1822) in Arcueil.\n\n【6】Berzelius introduced a new system of nomenclature in which the composition of any chemical compound could be represented using the first one or two letters of the Latin names of elements, and superscripts to designate the number of atoms present. He also used dots above the letters to indicate the proportions. However, this representation was rejected by German colleagues, who instead replaced the superscripts with subscripts, and thereby created the system of chemical annotation that continues to be used today.\n\n【7】Berzelius' 1819 publication of fixed proportions of chemical elements in compounds was supported by a large number of analytical results based on precise laboratory experiments. He reported the atomic weights of 45 of the 49 elements known at the time; 39 of the determinations were results of his own experiments, and the other 6 were performed by his students.\n\n【8】Berzelius is credited with discovering the elements cerium, selenium, silicon, zirconium, titanium, and thorium. He introduced rubber tubing into the laboratory as well as filter paper for analytical chemistry. Laboratory glassware was made by utilizing the blowpipe. He also introduced the concept of catalysts and isomerism, as well as the terms “cystine” and “glycine.”\n\n【9】Berzelius corresponded with many scientists in Europe, including Gerardus Mulder, a 35-year-old Dutch chemist with whom he carried out an extensive correspondence from 1834 to 1847. Mulder, in a letter to Berzelius dated July 10, 1838, said that he had discovered an oxidized basic radical in fibrin, serum, egg albumin, and gelatin. This substance could be combined in simple ratios with sulfur and phosphorous. Recognizing the importance of this observation, Berzelius suggested the term “protein,” which is derived from the Greek adjective πρώτειος, meaning “primary” or “of the first rank or position.” Mulder was also convinced of the importance of this substance, and published two lengthy papers (75 and 23 pages) in journals of which he was the editor.\n\n【10】Berzelius also contributed to medical education in Sweden. He emphasized that large hospitals were necessary for a school of medicine to properly educate physicians. In fact, he stated that Stockholm was the only city in Sweden where a medical school could be maintained, because he felt that all other cities were too small to support a teaching hospital. He felt that practical medicine was learned by caring for patients rather than simply reading a textbook. He emphasized that although he was able to pass medical examinations after his own University training, he was not qualified to care for the sick.\n\n【11】Berzelius suffered from many medical problems throughout his life. He had severe periodic headaches (probably migraines), which occurred regularly each month around the time of the new and full moon. The attacks disappeared in later life, but he then developed recurrent gout. He also had episodes of depression.\n\n【12】He decided at the age of 56 that he should wed and have a home life. In 1835, he married Elisabeth Poppius, the 24-year-old daughter of a Swedish cabinet minister. Upon his marriage, the King of Sweden gave him the title of Baron. Although he had no children, domestic life eased his remaining years. Over time, he became more set in his ideas and refused to accept newer developments in chemistry. He spent less time in the laboratory and more of his time trying to discredit new ideas and theories. Nevertheless, along with Boyle, Lavoisier, and Dalton, Berzelius is often called a “Father of Chemistry” today.\n\n【13】He died in Stockholm August 7, 1848. His birthday on August 20 is celebrated at Stockholm University as “Berzelius Day.” He was honored philatelically by Sweden in 1939 (Scott #293, #295 and #297) and again in 1979 (Scott #1279), and by Grenada in 1987 with a transliterated first name (Scott #1536).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

According to the authors, the incidence of HCC in this population (6.9 per 100,000 population) is higher than the reported national average (3.0 per 100,000 population) largely because of differences in establishing the HCC diagnosis. As the article points out, the requirement of histologic confirmation of HCC in many databases may substantially underestimate the incidences reported elsewhere because nationally and internationally established guidelines do not always require histologic confirmation to establish disease.\n\n【26】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【27】Management of hepatocellular carcinoma: an update.\n\n【28】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【29】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【30】Multidisciplinary Canadian consensus recommendations for the management and treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n【31】As stated by Yang et al, most patients diagnosed as having HCC from 1976 to 2000 had alcohol-related liver disease as their primary risk factor, but, following recent national trends, from 2001 to 2008 HCV infection was the most commonly identified risk factor for HCC.\n\n【32】Since 1990, immigration from sub-Saharan Africa to the United States has increased markedly, and according to US Census estimates, 25,000 to 50,000 Somalis currently live in Minnesota. Somalia, like all countries in sub-Saharan Africa, is in an area of high prevalence for HBV infection. Because few epidemiologic data have been available from Somalia since 1992, little is known about the incidence rates of HCV in this region.\n\n【33】The other article in the current issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , by Shire et al, states that Somalis in this part of Minnesota are more likely to be infected with HBV than with HCV. Surprisingly, the rate of chronic HCV infection was seen more often in patients diagnosed as having HCC than in those with hepatitis B infection. As the authors point out, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published guidelines for screening individuals emigrating to the United States for HBV infection, but currently there are no guidelines that govern screening immigrants for HCV infection.\n\n【34】It is currently estimated that 170 million to 180 million people worldwide and 3 million to 4 million people in the United States are infected with HCV. Most individuals infected with the virus in the United States have now been infected for 10 to 30 years, and it is the progression of fibrosis in chronic HCV infection that places them at risk for HCC. The estimated risk of HCC is 15 to 20 times higher in persons infected with HCV than among those not infected with the virus. It has been projected that new cases of HCV-related HCC will continue to increase during the next 2 to 3 decades.\n\n【35】Chronic infection with HBV is responsible for approximately half of all cases of HCC worldwide. HBV infection is implicated in almost all cases of HCC occurring in childhood. In areas of endemic HBV infection, such as Southeast Asia and Africa, the most common transmission of the virus occurs from mother to newborn. Through this vertical route of transmission, up to 90% of infected individuals will develop a chronic disease course. The risk of HCC in these patients occurs even without significant fibrosis, so screening guidelines for HCC with early HBV acquisition recommend screening at a younger age (40 years for Asian men and 50 years for Asian women, as well as for Africans with hepatitis B or HBV carriers with a family history of HCC)\n\n【36】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【37】Management of hepatocellular carcinoma: an update.\n\n【38】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【39】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【40】Management of hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n【41】than that for the remainder of the at-risk population.\n\n【42】The primary risk factor for the development of HCC in patients with liver disease is progression to cirrhosis. More than 80% of patients with HCC will develop the disease in the setting of cirrhosis. Although there are patient populations, such as those described in these 2 studies with HBV and HCV infection, that are at higher risk for developing HCC, _any_ patient with cirrhosis is at increased risk for developing HCC.

The decision to enter a patient into a surveillance program is determined by the level of risk for HCC and the likelihood of early detection benefits.

{"seq_id": "9bffa4eb-7909-4b6e-9040-65f08ce83f86", "title": "Clinical Pearls in Neurology", "text": "【0】At the 2001 Annual Conference of the American College of Physicians, a new teaching format to aid physician learning, Clinical Pearls, was introduced. Clinical Pearls is designed with the 3 qualities of physician-learners in mind. First, we physicians enjoy learning from cases. Second, we like concise, practical points that we can use in our practice. Finally, we take pleasure in problem solving.\n\n【1】In the Clinical Pearls format, speakers present a number of short cases in their specialty to a general internal medicine audience. Each case is followed by a multiple-choice question answered live by attendees using an audience response system. The answer distribution is shown to attendees. The correct answer is then displayed and the speaker discusses teaching points, clarifying why one answer is most appropriate. Each case presentation ends with a Clinical Pearl, defined as a practical teaching point that is supported by the literature but generally not well known to most internists.\n\n【2】Clinical Pearls is currently one of the most popular sessions at the American College of Physicians meeting. As a service to its readers, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ has invited a selected number of these Clinical Pearl presentations to be published in our Concise Reviews for Clinicians section. “Clinical Pearls in Neurology” is one of them.\n\n【3】Case 1\n------\n\n【4】A 70-year-old man with a history of smoking and hypertension is seen in urgent care 3 hours after awakening with first-ever acute vertigo, vomiting, and imbalance in the absence of headache or other focal neurologic or otologic symptoms. Vertigo persists even while sitting upright with his head still. He is unable to walk unassisted due to ataxia.\n\n【5】### Question\n\n【6】**Which physical examination test is _most useful_ in this setting to differentiate between acute vestibular neuritis and cerebellar infarction?**\n\n【7】*   a\n\n【8】    Head impulse test (HIT)\n\n【9】*   b\n\n【10】    Dix-Hallpike test\n\n【11】*   c\n\n【12】    Cover testing for skew deviation\n\n【13】*   d\n\n【14】    Romberg test\n\n【15】*   e\n\n【16】    Examination for Babinski sign\n\n【17】### Discussion\n\n【18】Distinguishing an acute peripheral vestibulopathy (vestibular neuritis) from a posterior circulation infarction in the acutely vertiginous patient is challenging. Focal neurologic signs are often lacking in cerebellar infarction. Proper management differs widely between the 2 conditions, and computed tomography has poor sensitivity for brainstem and cerebellar ischemic strokes in the acute setting. The Dix-Hallpike test is used specifically to test for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), which is unlikely in this case given the persisting vertigo while sitting still. Romberg test may be abnormal in both conditions (although patients with cerebellar infarction may have such severe truncal ataxia as to be unable to sit or stand), and the Babinski sign would be absent in both. Fortunately, several features elicited on bedside examination have been found to be very useful for distinguishing benign from dangerous causes of acute vertigo .\n\n【19】The head impulse test is a simple bedside examination technique to evaluate the integrity of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) generated from stimulating each horizontal semicircular canal.\n\n【20】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【21】A clinical sign of canal paresis.\n\n【22】With the patient watching the examiner's nose, the examiner very rapidly rotates the patient's head 15 degrees to one side and watches to see if the VOR is able to keep the eyes fixed on the examiner's nose. In a peripheral vestibulopathy, rapid rotation toward the side of the lesion does not generate a sufficient VOR to keep the eyes on target, and a small “catch-up” saccadic (fast) eye movement will be required immediately after the head rotation to refixate on the target . However, acute vertigo from a cerebellar infarction spares the VOR and results in a normal HIT. In addition, skew deviation (supranuclear vertical eye misalignment) can be assessed at the bedside with alternate cover testing and is a specific but quite insensitive marker for brainstem or cerebellar lesions in acute vertigo. Finally, spontaneous nystagmus direction reflects the origin of the vertigo: Acute peripheral vestibulopathy produces unidirectional horizontal nystagmus with quick phases beating away from the side of the lesion, whereas central lesions may cause direction-changing gaze-evoked nystagmus and/or dominantly vertical or torsional spontaneous nystagmus. The combination of these 3 examination findings (HIT, skew deviation, and spontaneous nystagmus direction) appears to be more sensitive than diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in acute vertigo.\n\n【23】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【24】HINTS to diagnose stroke in the acute vestibular syndrome: three-step bedside oculomotor examination more sensitive than early MRI diffusion-weighted imaging.\n\n【25】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【26】The HIT is the most sensitive and specific bedside test for distinguishing central from peripheral causes in the acute vestibular syndrome when other focal neurologic or otologic findings are lacking.\n\n【27】Case 2\n------\n\n【28】A 66-year-old woman is seen for evaluation of a 3-week history of positional vertigo episodes. Symptoms began 2 days after bumping her head under a counter. Since then, she may experience 20-second-long episodes of vertigo upon rolling over in bed or first sitting up in the morning, and she feels unsteady making quick head turns while walking. She has no history of vertigo or other neurologic symptoms. Examination is normal. Dix-Hallpike test is negative bilaterally, without producing any vertigo or nystagmus.\n\n【29】### Question\n\n【30】**What should be the _next step_ in evaluation or management?**\n\n【31】*   a\n\n【32】    Vestibular function testing\n\n【33】*   b\n\n【34】    MRI of the brain and internal auditory canals\n\n【35】*   c\n\n【36】    Testing for horizontal canal BPPV (hc-BPPV)\n\n【37】*   d\n\n【38】    Epley maneuver\n\n【39】*   e\n\n【40】    Meclizine and reassurance\n\n【41】### Discussion\n\n【42】The patient's history strongly suggests BPPV, the most common vestibular disorder with a cumulative incidence of nearly 10% by age 80 years.\n\n【43】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【44】Epidemiology of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo: a population based study.\n\n【45】Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is caused by dislodged otoconia from the labyrinthine utricle that float into a semicircular canal and render it abnormally excited by changes in head position with respect to gravity. Few conditions other than BPPV cause brief, purely positional episodes of isolated vertigo. Cerebellar or craniocervical junction abnormalities can cause positional nystagmus that is typically purely vertical or torsional, persists for the duration that the head position is maintained, and does not produce severe vertiginous symptoms.\n\n【46】Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo affecting the posterior semicircular canal (pc-BPPV) occurs in 85% of patients, causing a transient mixed upbeat/torsional nystagmus on the Dix-Hallpike test. Once the affected side is determined, it can be treated effectively with the Epley canalith repositioning procedure. About 10% of BPPV affects the horizontal canal (hc-BPPV). Symptoms are essentially identical to those of pc-BPPV, so it should be suspected with the typical history when Dix-Hallpike test is negative. A supine roll test \n\n【47】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【48】Quality Standards Subcommittee, American Academy of Neurology  \nPractice parameter: therapies for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (an evidence-based review): a report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n【49】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【50】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【51】Horizontal semicircular canal variant of benign positional vertigo.\n\n【52】should be performed from the supine position by turning the head 90 degrees to the right and then to the left. Nystagmus elicited in hc-BPPV is horizontal and changes direction depending on which ear is down. Most commonly, the horizontal nystagmus beats toward the ground (geotropic) with the head to either side, and the strongest nystagmus occurs with the affected ear down. If all positional testing results are negative but the history suggests BPPV, it is more useful to repeat positional testing another day than to order an MRI.\n\n【53】Several treatment options exist for hc-BPPV, the simplest of which is the Lempert (barbecue roll) maneuver\n\n【54】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【55】Quality Standards Subcommittee, American Academy of Neurology  \nPractice parameter: therapies for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (an evidence-based review): a report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology.\n\n【56】: With the patient supine and the affected ear down, the head (and body as required) is rotated in 90-degree increments toward the healthy side, holding each position for 10 to 30 seconds, until the patient makes a full circle with the affected ear down again. The patient is then simultaneously returned to supine face up and rapidly sat up. Like the Epley maneuver for the posterior canal, the concept is to move the head in such a way as to liberate the otoconia from the canal back into the utricle.\n\n【57】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【58】Horizontal canal BPPV is less common than pc-BPPV but is also treatable with a simple repositioning maneuver in the office.\n\n【59】Case 3\n------\n\n【60】A 41-year-old woman sees you for a 3-year history of spontaneous episodes consisting of vertigo, nausea, vomiting, and imbalance, each lasting hours to a few days. She has had a total of 10 attacks and reports a concurrent headache with 3 of them; she usually has associated photophobia. Sometimes the episodes seem triggered by missed meals, stress, or menses. She feels well between attacks. You elicit a lifelong history of motion sickness and a 20-year history of occasional migraine headaches without aura. Her grandmother had Ménière disease, and 2 family members have migraine.\n\n【61】### Question\n\n【62】**What is the _most likely_ cause of this patient's recurrent spontaneous episodes of vertigo?**\n\n【63】*   a\n\n【64】    Vestibular migraine (VM)\n\n【65】*   b\n\n【66】    Ménière disease\n\n【67】*   c\n\n【68】    Vertebrobasilar insufficiency\n\n【69】*   d\n\n【70】    Superior canal dehiscence syndrome\n\n【71】*   e\n\n【72】    Basilar-type migraine\n\n【73】### Discussion\n\n【74】Ménière disease is a condition producing attacks of vertigo, tinnitus, fluctuating ipsilateral hearing loss, and aural fullness typically lasting 2 to 3 hours and is thought to result from distortion of the membranous labyrinth leading to endolymphatic hydrops. The absence of auditory symptoms and the history of some episodes lasting for days would make Meniere disease unlikely in this case. Vertebrobasilar insufficiency would be an unlikely cause of episodes lasting hours to days and recurring over years. Superior canal dehiscence syndrome is an uncommon condition in which dehiscence of the thin petrous bone separating the roof of the superior semicircular canal from the middle cranial fossa leads to sound- and pressure-induced auditory and vestibular symptoms. Manifestations may include brief episodes of noise- or Valsalva maneuver–induced vertigo, hyperacusis for bone-conducted sound (such as pulsatile tinnitus and hearing one's own voice loudly in the affected ear), and apparent conductive hearing loss on audiometry, none of which is present in this patient.\n\n【75】Vestibular migraine (or migrainous vertigo) is the most common cause of recurrent spontaneous episodes of vertigo, with a prevalence estimated at 1% in the general population.\n\n【76】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【77】Migrainous vertigo: prevalence and impact on quality of life.\n\n【78】Studies from tertiary dizziness clinics\n\n【79】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【80】Migraine and isolated recurrent vertigo of unknown cause.\n\n【81】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【82】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【83】Association of benign recurrent vertigo and migraine in 208 patients.\n\n【84】have found that among patients who have chronic recurrent attacks of vertigo without otologic symptoms and no other cause for their symptoms, 61% to 87% are also migraine sufferers. Vestibular migraine affects predominantly women, peaks in the third to fifth decades, and is typically preceded by migraine headaches for years (although the headaches may be mild enough not to be mentioned by the patient). The pathophysiology of VM remains unclear but likely involves central and peripheral vestibular pathways. It is diagnosed by history (and typically normal examination findings), although tests may be needed to rule out other conditions. Diagnostic criteria include episodic vestibular symptoms of at least moderate severity in which migrainous symptoms (headache, photophobia, phonophobia, aura) accompany at least 2 attacks in a patient with a current or previous history of migraine.\n\n【85】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【86】Vestibular migraine.\n\n【87】Supporting features include vertigo precipitated by food triggers, sleep irregularities, or hormonal changes; strong family history of migraine; and reduction in attacks with migraine preventative medications. Less than 10% of VM patients meet criteria for basilar-type migraine, which requires 2 or more basilar-distribution neurologic symptoms lasting between 5 and 60 minutes. Although both VM and Meniere disease can cause vertigo lasting for hours, findings favoring VM include vertigo attacks also lasting a day or more and only minimal or bilateral aural symptoms with a normal audiogram.\n\n【88】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【89】Vestibular migraine is a common but underdiagnosed cause of recurrent vertigo most commonly affecting young to middle-aged women. Diagnosed on clinical grounds, management typically begins with migraine preventive strategies similar to those for migraine headaches.\n\n【90】Case 4\n------\n\n【91】Your 62-year-old patient returns 1 month after neurologic consultation confirming your suspicion of idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD) causing new-onset asymmetric rest tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and a shuffling gait. A treatment regimen of carbidopa/levodopa, 25/100-mg tablets 3 times per day with meals, was initiated and has been titrated up to 2½ tablets per dose. Very little benefit has been noticed, however.\n\n【92】### Question\n\n【93】**What is the _most likely_ cause of the poor medication response?**\n\n【94】*   a\n\n【95】    He should have been given controlled-release carbidopa/levodopa\n\n【96】*   b\n\n【97】    He should be taking the carbidopa/levodopa on an empty stomach\n\n【98】*   c\n\n【99】    He should titrate up to 3 tablets per dose\n\n【100】*   d\n\n【101】    A dopamine agonist would be more potent\n\n【102】*   e\n\n【103】    He has a different disorder such as multiple system atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy\n\n【104】### Discussion\n\n【105】In the absence of additional clinical features such as dementia, autonomic failure, or cerebellar ataxia, the presence of asymmetric parkinsonism with rest tremor suggests a diagnosis of idiopathic PD. Initial levodopa treatment is the most efficacious therapy, and a good clinical response to a proper trial provides confirmatory diagnostic evidence for idiopathic PD.\n\n【106】When levodopa was introduced in the 1960s, nausea and vomiting were frequent problems due to premature conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, which then stimulates the brainstem chemoreceptor trigger zone to cause nausea. Taking levodopa with food helped reduce nausea. Unfortunately, if taken with food, levodopa must compete with other ingested large neutral amino acids to cross the intestinal mucosa and blood-brain barrier via saturable transport mechanisms, leading to reduced bioavailability of the medication.\n\n【107】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【108】Pharmacokinetics of levodopa.\n\n【109】The addition of carbidopa to levodopa formulations in 1973 reduced peripheral conversion of levodopa to dopamine and greatly improved tolerability. The tradename Sinemet is derived from _sin_ (Latin), meaning _without_ , and _emet_ (Greek), meaning _emesis_ . Still, well-meaning pharmacists may instruct patients to take it with food. Carbidopa/levodopa is best started as 25/100-mg immediate-release (yellow) tablets in 3 doses, each given 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals. Each dose is titrated from one-half or 1 tablet in half-tablet increments up to 3 tablets based on clinical benefit, which is typically seen at 400 to 800 mg/d of levodopa.\n\n【110】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【111】Levodopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.\n\n【112】Individual doses above 3 tablets have little added benefit and are more likely to cause peak-dose dyskinesias. If nausea develops, it is usually mild, resolves with continued administration, and can be countered with soda crackers (low protein) eaten with each dose. Most newly treated patients do not have short-duration responses or clinical fluctuations with this regimen. Immediate-release carbidopa/levodopa is also substantially cheaper than any alternative.\n\n【113】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【114】Carbidopa/levodopa should be taken on an empty stomach to maximize absorption and bioavailability. If nausea develops, it is usually mild, transient, and countered by eating a few soda crackers.\n\n【115】Case 5\n------\n\n【116】A healthy 32-year-old woman with a 1-year history of increasingly frequent episodic unilateral headaches associated with nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia is evaluated in the clinic between headaches. Neurologic examination is normal. She undergoes MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head, which demonstrate a 4-mm saccular aneurysm at the junction of the internal carotid and ophthalmic arteries. There is no known personal or family history of ruptured or unruptured aneurysms.\n\n【117】### Question\n\n【118】**What are the _most appropriate_ interpretation and course of action at this time?**\n\n【119】*   a\n\n【120】    Headaches are migraines. Aneurysm is incidental. No further action required\n\n【121】*   b\n\n【122】    Enlarging aneurysm is likely causing headaches. Emergent coiling/clipping is needed\n\n【123】*   c\n\n【124】    Aneurysm is incidental, but rupture risk is high. Needs urgent intervention\n\n【125】*   d\n\n【126】    Rupture risk is 10% in the next 6 months. Obtain prompt cerebrovascular consultation\n\n【127】*   e\n\n【128】    Rupture risk is extremely low. Reassure patient. Routine cerebrovascular consultation to consider options and surveillance\n\n【129】### Discussion\n\n【130】Intracranial aneurysms are acquired lesions at intracranial arterial branching sites. About 2% of the general population or 3 to 6 million Americans harbor intracranial aneurysms, which are increasingly detected with routine use of advanced neuroimaging. About 25,000 aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhages occur each year in the United States, so most aneurysms do not rupture; however, the case fatality rate from rupture is 30% to 40%. Women have aneurysms 3 times as commonly as men. Patients with coarctation of the aorta or adult polycystic kidney disease have a prevalence of 10% and should be screened with MRA.\n\n【131】Rupture risk is most closely linked to aneurysm size and location, although smoking, hypertension, and a personal or family history of subarachnoid hemorrhage also increases rupture risk. Fortunately, aneurysms most commonly affect the anterior circulation (internal carotid, middle or anterior cerebral arteries) and are less than 7 mm in size, both features associated with an extremely low rupture rate.\n\n【132】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【133】International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms Investigators  \nUnruptured intracranial aneurysms: natural history, clinical outcome, and risks of surgical and endovascular treatment.\n\n【134】The 5-year cumulative rupture rate for anterior circulation aneurysms smaller than 7 mm is nearly 0%. However, a 7- to 12-mm posterior cerebral or vertebrobasilar aneurysm has a 14.5% 5-year rupture rate. Thus, this woman with migraine can be reassured, queried for conditions or family history that would increase rupture risk, and referred routinely for cerebrovascular evaluation. Follow-up imaging is typically performed at 6 months and then yearly for 3 years since 5% to 10% of aneurysms will grow during this time, especially if they are larger when first detected (83% if over 12 mm).\n\n【135】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【136】Intracranial aneurysm enlargement on serial magnetic resonance angiography: frequency and risk factors.\n\n【137】Younger patients with posterior circulation aneurysms or aneurysms smaller than 7 mm may be candidates for treatment with coiling or clipping, whereas risks and benefits must be more carefully weighed in older patients.\n\n【138】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【139】Intracranial aneurysm rupture rates are exceedingly low with asymptomatic aneurysms smaller than 7 mm affecting the anterior circulation. Larger size and posterior location as well as personal and family risk factors increase the rupture rate.\n\n【140】Case 6\n------\n\n【141】You are seeing a 58-year-old woman in the clinic because she awoke that morning with complete left-side ptosis. She had complained of dull left orbital pain the day before. Her history is significant for migraines, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. Examination reveals complete left-side ptosis, 2 mm of anisocoria (left pupil larger than right), and impaired left ocular motility. She cannot adduct the eye past the primary position, has impaired upgaze, and develops intorsion on attempted downgaze . The rest of the examation findings are normal.\n\n【142】### Question\n\n【143】**What are the _most likely_ diagnosis and _best_ next step?**\n\n【144】*   a\n\n【145】    Ophthalmoplegic migraine; sumatriptan\n\n【146】*   b\n\n【147】    Isolated third cranial nerve palsy; angiography\n\n【148】*   c\n\n【149】    Ischemic fourth cranial nerve palsy; erythrocyte sedimentation rate\n\n【150】*   d\n\n【151】    Myasthenia gravis; refer for edrophonium test\n\n【152】*   e\n\n【153】    Dorsal midbrain infarction; MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging\n\n【154】### Discussion\n\n【155】The patient has an acute, isolated, complete third (oculomotor) cranial nerve palsy. The third cranial nerve travels from the midbrain to the orbit to innervate the superior, inferior, and medial recti, the inferior oblique, levator palpebrae, and the iris sphincter and ciliary muscles of the lens. Abduction from the lateral rectus (abducens nerve) is intact. Intorsion on downgaze implies preserved superior oblique (fourth cranial nerve) function. Although myasthenia gravis can mimic virtually any ocular motor palsy, its onset is rarely so acute, unilateral, and specific for third cranial nerve–innervated muscles (and the pupil is unaffected in myasthenia gravis). Ophthalmoplegic migraine most commonly affects the third cranial nerve but is rare, typically preceded by prolonged migraine headache, and mainly affects children.\n\n【156】An enlarging posterior communicating artery aneurysm is the dreaded and presumed cause of an acquired isolated third cranial nerve palsy until proven otherwise. Since microvascular ischemia within the third cranial nerve is a more common cause in older patients with vascular risk factors, the “rule of the pupil” traditionally helped predict the likelihood of an aneurysm. Because the pupillomotor fibers sit on the surface of the nerve, a compressive aneurysmal third cranial nerve palsy would be expected to cause a dilated pupil. Thus, an otherwise _complete_ isolated third cranial nerve palsy that _spared_ the pupil was presumed to be ischemic. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (to rule out giant cell arteritis) and serum glucose level were determined, and the patient could be closely observed for expected recovery within 8 to 12 weeks. The footnote to the rule was that if there was _incomplete_ ptosis or ophthalmoparesis, a normal pupil provides no reassurance against an aneurysm. Given the risks of catheter cerebral angiography, this rule has proved useful in guiding selection of those who need angiography.\n\n【157】Unfortunately, clinical features do not allow perfect guidance on the aneurysm risk. The presence of headache or orbital pain is nonspecific. Up to 20% of patients with microvascular ischemic third cranial nerve palsy have anisocoria, but rarely more than 1.5 mm difference. Although microvascular ischemia is much more likely in a pupil- _sparing_ complete third cranial nerve palsy, the high morbidity of an enlarging symptomatic aneurysm and imperfect discrimination on clinical grounds support some neuroimaging in all acquired isolated third cranial nerve palsies, regardless of pupil status, especially in patients younger than age 50 years.

Mayo Clinic website.\n\n【3】— William J. Mayo, MD\n\n【4】Patient autonomy and input in clinical decision making has been an area of increasing interest in the past 2 decades. In contemporary practice, patients are frequently asked to take a major part in making complex decisions regarding their health. Indeed, documentation of shared decision making is now required for reimbursement of some major procedures.\n\n【5】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【6】Mandatory shared decision making by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for cardiovascular procedures and other tests.\n\n【7】Optimal implementation of shared decision making requires proper patient understanding of the risks and benefits of the recommended treatment. Unfortunately, the physician’s ability to understand and communicate those risks and benefits is hindered by the increasing complexity of data analytics and data presentation methods in modern research, as well as the time constraints imposed by busy practice models. In this viewpoint, we highlight the issue of risk framing in the medical literature and its potential effect on patient and physician perceptions of risks, benefits, and their preparedness to make important decisions regarding their cardiovascular health.\n\n【8】### Relative vs Absolute Risk Framing\n\n【9】Discerning the risk of adverse events and the benefit of an intervention to reduce that risk is a fundamental pillar of medical practice. However, the magnitude of risks and benefits can be reported in various forms (relative \\[RRR\\] and absolute \\[ARR\\] risk reduction, hazard ratio, time-to-event, etc). This variability may have major consequences on the perception of those risks and benefits by both the physician and the patient alike, especially when considering costly medications or interventions. For example, in the field of cardiovascular medicine, the potential benefit from a certain intervention is usually stated to the patient in the form of RRR rather than ARR. Although this may be appropriate from a population health standpoint, it may be misleading and less meaningful to the individual patient, whose main interest remains his or her own health.\n\n【10】### Aggregate vs Individualized Risk Framing\n\n【11】The average treatment effects are usually reported for the overall cohort of patients and do not account for individual patients’ risk profiles. This practice may obscure important categories of patients who do not benefit and may be harmed by the treatment. However, unfortunately, the ability to devise risk scores that will estimate the risk of benefit or harm for individual patients is often limited by many factors, such as the low number of events, the frequent use of composite end points, the lack of incentives by study sponsors, etc.\n\n【12】Herein we illustrate the challenges associated with risk framing from a patient perspective using the example of 3 cardiovascular interventions .\n\n【13】Table Illustration of the Benefit of Medical Treatment From a Patient Perspective\n\n【14】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【15】ARR = absolute risk reduction; ASA = aspirin; MACE = major adverse cardiovascular event; NNT = number needed to treat; RRR = relative risk reduction.\n\n| Clinical statement | Outcome | Event rate (%) | RRR (%) | ARR (%) | NNT | Likelihood of no benefit (%) | Individualized risk/benefit score |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ASA + clopidogrel is superior to ASA alone in patients with acute coronary syndrome and no ST-segment elevation | MACEbDeath (cardiovascular causes), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke. | 9.3 vs 11.4 | 20 | 2.1 | 47 | 97.9 | Not available |\n| Apixaban reduces the risk of hemorrhagic strokes by 50% compared with warfarin | Hemorrhagic stroke | 0.24 vs 0.47 | 49 | 0.23 | 238 | 99.8 | Not available |\n| Adding canagliflozin to standard of care in diabetic patients with renal insufficiency improves outcomes | MACEbDeath (cardiovascular causes), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke. | 9.9 vs 12.2 | 20 | 2.3 | 40 | 97.7 | Not available |\n\n【17】a ARR = absolute risk reduction; ASA = aspirin; MACE = major adverse cardiovascular event; NNT = number needed to treat; RRR = relative risk reduction.\n\n【18】b Death (cardiovascular causes), nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke.\n\n【19】### Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients With Acute Coronary Syndrome Without ST-Segment Elevation\n\n【20】In the Clopidogrel in Unstable Angina to Prevent Recurrent Events (CURE) trial, patients who received clopidogrel + standard of care had lower rates of the composite primary end point (death \\[cardiovascular causes\\], nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke) compared with those who received placebo at 1 year (9.3% vs 11.4%; _P_ < .001).\n\n【21】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【22】Effects of clopidogrel in addition to aspirin in patients with acute coronary syndromes without ST-segment elevation.\n\n【23】This represented a remarkable 20% RRR and led to widespread adoption of clopidogrel in the management of acute coronary syndrome. However, for an individual patient, clopidogrel in this setting would reduce his or her chance of the composite end point by only 2.1%, mostly driven by reduction of nonfatal myocardial infarction. Furthermore, despite the routine use of clopidogrel, there are no risk scores that would allow personalized risk/benefit assessment for individual patients.\n\n【24】### Apixaban vs Warfarin for Stroke Prevention in Patients With Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation\n\n【25】Direct oral anticoagulants are replacing warfarin as the most commonly used anticoagulants for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. This shift was driven by the similar efficacy in stroke reduction but the lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage with those agents vs with warfarin. In one landmark trial, the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage per year with apixaban was reported to be approximately 50% lower than that with warfarin (0.24% vs 0.47%; _P_ < .001).\n\n【26】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【27】Apixaban versus warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\n【28】However, from a single patient perspective, the ARR of intracranial hemorrhage with apixaban was 0.23%, corresponding to a likelihood of not deriving benefit from an incremental reduction in intracranial hemorrhage with apixaban of approximately 99.8%. Such reframing is critically important in understanding the true magnitude of benefit (or risk), particularly when out-of-pocket costs vary markedly between these treatment options (∼$18 for warfarin vs $556 for apixaban).\n\n【29】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【30】Warfarin alternatives: are Eliquis and Xarelto worth the cost? GoodRx website.\n\n【31】### Canagliflozin in Diabetic Patients With Renal Insufficiency\n\n【32】Patients with diabetes mellitus are a disadvantaged group with a high burden of cardiovascular risk factors. Several studies have recently assessed the role of novel agents in reducing the excess cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. In the Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes With Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation (CREDENCE) trial, patients who received canagliflozin, 100 mg daily, had a lower incidence of the composite primary end point (death \\[cardiovascular causes\\], nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke) at 2.6 years (9.9% vs 12.2%; _P_ < .001), which translates into a 20% RRR.\n\n【33】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【34】Canagliflozin and cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease in primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention groups: results from the randomized CREDENCE trial.\n\n【35】On the other hand, from a patient’s perspective, only 2% of patients will derive some benefit from this costly medication (>$500 out-of-pocket monthly copay), whereas the other 98% would see no incremental benefit from the treatment, but all would bear the expense of a costly new therapeutic agent.\n\n【36】Patients live in an absolute world. The focus on RRR and the lack of individualized risk/benefit assessment tools in the literature continues to divert from what is meaningful to the main stakeholders in medicine, the individual patient.

In the late 1970s, epidemiological studies revealed that Greenland Inuits had substantially reduced rates of acute myocardial infarction compared with Western control subjects. These observations generated more than 4500 studies to explore this and other effects of ω-3 fatty acids on human metabolism and health. From epidemiology to cell culture and animal studies to randomized controlled trials, the cardioprotective effects of ω-3 fatty acids are becoming recognized. These fatty acids, when incorporated into the diet at levels of about 1 g/d, seem to be able to stabilize myocardial membranes electrically, resulting in reduced susceptibility to ventricular dysrhythmias, thereby reducing the risk of sudden death. The recent GISSI (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico)-Prevention study of 11,324 patients showed a 45% decrease in risk of sudden cardiac death and a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality in the group taking 850 mg/d of ω-3 fatty acids. These fatty acids have potent anti-inflammatory effects and may also be antiatherogenic. Higher doses of ω-3 fatty acids can lower elevated serum triglyceride levels; 3 to 5 g/d can reduce triglyceride levels by 30% to 50%, minimizing the risk of both coronary heart disease and acute pancreatitis.

After 3.5 years, the ω-3 group had a 20% reduction (95% confidence interval \\[Cl\\], 6%-33%) in total mortality and a 45% decrease (95% CI, 24%-60%) in sudden cardiac death . The improvements in cardiac prognosis were especially impressive considering that these patients were otherwise well treated medically with antiplatelet drugs, β-blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and that 50% were taking statins at the end of the trial. These results imply that 850 mg of ω-3 FAs can be expected to save approximately 20 lives per 1000 patients with CHD treated over a 3.5-year period. This translates into 5.7 lives saved per year and compares well with the 5 lives saved per year with pravastatin in the LIPID (LongTerm Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease) trial.\n\n【68】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【69】*   Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischacmic Disease (LIPID) Study Group\n\n【70】Prevention of cardiovascular events and death with pravastatin in patients with coronary heart disease and a broad range of initial cholesterol levels.\n\n【71】Of importance, the benefits of ω-3 FAs on improving survival in the GISSI-Prevention study appeared to be independent of traditional risk factors like lipids and blood pressure and are in addition to the benefits conferred by standard preventive therapies.\n\n【72】Figure 3 GISSI (Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvi-venza nell'Infarto miocardico)-Prevention study.\n\n【73】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【74】*   Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarto miocardico\n\n【75】Dietary supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E after myocardial infarction: results of the GISSI-Prevenzione trial.\n\n【76】Compared to the control group of 5658 patients who had had a myocardial infarction, the ω-3 fatty acid group ( _N_ \\=5666) had significant reductions in total cardiovascular (CV) events ( _P_ \\=.022), total mortality ( _P_ \\=.008), and sudden death ( _P_ \\=.004).\n\n【77】A previous prospective, randomized, controlled study of fish oil for secondary prevention of CHD was the Diet and Reinfarction Trial (DART).\n\n【78】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【79】Effects of changes in fat, fish, and fibre intakes on death and myocardial reinfarction: Diet and Reinfarction Trial.\n\n【80】Men (N=2033) who had a myocardial infarction were randomized to receive different types of dietary advice in an effort to forestall the next myocardial infarction. One half were advised to increase their ω-3 intake by eating oily fish (eg, salmon, herring, mackerel) twice weekly, while the other half received “usual care.” Survival over the subsequent 2 years was the primary end point. The group that was told to consume fish had a 29% reduction in overall mortality . Because about 25% of the patients did not want to eat fish, they were given fish oil capsules (providing 900 mg/d of EPA and DHA).

This is a plant-derived ω-3 FA found in soybean, canoIa, and, especially, flaxseed oil, in nuts (primarily walnuts), and in green leafy vegetables.

After about 4 years, the patients consuming the Mediterranean diet experienced a 55% reduction in all-cause mortality ( _P_ \\=.03).

Because ω-3 FAs at the recommended intake of 1 g/d seem to be safe, it is reasonable to suggest this dosage as a target for all adults with a worrisome eRn risk factor profile. However, clinicians must recognize that the efficacy of ω-3 FAs in primary prevention has not yet been demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【291】Prescribing Ω-3 Fas\n-------------------\n\n【292】There are 2 general purposes for recommending increased intake of ω-3 FAs: prevention of CHD and lowering of elevated triglyceride levels. The dosages needed to achieve these goals differ. As previously noted, approximately 750 to 1000 mg of ω-3 FAs should significantly reduce risk of sudden cardiac death. Patients should be encouraged to consume fish or take supplements, whichever source they find most appropriate . For those who like fish, a dietary approach including about four 3-oz servings of oily fish weekly will be adequate; for those who do not like or cannot get fish, capsules of ω-3 FAs should be effective and are essentially without risk.

Clearly, these amounts cannot be obtained by dietary means but require supplementation. Most standard fish oil concentrates contain 300 mg of EPA and DHA per 1-g capsule. Thus, 10 to 12 capsules would be required per day to achieve these intakes. With a moderately concentrated product (50% of ω-3 FAs), 7 tablets per day will suffice. The formulation used in the GISSI-Prevention study was a highly refined fish oil consisting of 85% EPA and DHA.

Augmenting ω-3 FA blood levels, either by increasing the consumption of oily fish or by supplementation with ω-3 FA capsules, results in unique and substantial clinical benefits that are independent of traditional risk factors. Ready acceptance by physicians and patients for this intervention is likely because of the following factors about ω-3 FAs. (1) They are natural dietary components with no clinically important adverse effects, especially at intakes of less than 3 g/d. (2) Relatively small doses (approximately 1 g/d) seem to be protective. (3) They have no known adverse interactions with other agents used for the prevention or treatment of CHD. (4) They can be obtained from dietary sources or in purified form from capsules. (5) The benefits are in addition to those of other therapeutic interventions for CHD (eg, statins, asnirin hypotensive hvnotensive azentsetc).\n\n【327】After 30 years of research, we believe that evidence is now sufficient to recommend not only fish for cardiac patients but also EPA and DHA. These simple nutrients will augment the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with cardiovascular disease and should save lives.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Applying a simplified scoring algorithm, we then used exploratory factor analysis with orthogonal rotation and eigenvalue calculations to extract internally consistent domains and to reduce dimensionality. This analysis was followed by expert revisions to eliminate redundant content and to retain clinically important questions and final assessment of the new instrument.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The new simplified scoring algorithm alone resulted in higher Cronbach α values in all domains. Factor analysis revealed 7 domains with a total of 54 questions retained. Expert revisions resulted in further reduction of questions and domains with a remaining total of 31 questions in 6 domains (COMPASS 31). Measures of internal consistency were much improved compared to those for COMPASS. Following appropriate weighting, this instrument provides an autonomic symptom score from 0 to 100.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】COMPASS 31 is a refined, internally consistent, and markedly abbreviated quantitative measure of autonomic symptoms.

These high-risk manifestations of coronary atherosclerosis are important causes of the use of emergency medical care and hospitalization in the United States. A quick but thorough assessment of the patient's history and findings on physical examination, electrocardiography, radiologic studies, and cardiac biomarker tests permit accurate diagnosis and aid in early risk stratification, which is essential for guiding treatment. High-risk patients with UA/NSTEMI are often treated with an early invasive strategy involving cardiac catheterization and prompt revascularization of viable myocardium at risk. Clinical outcomes can be optimized by revascularization coupled with aggressive medical therapy that includes anti-ischemic, antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and lipid-lowering drugs. Evidence-based guidelines provide recommendations for the management of ACS; however, therapeutic approaches to the management of ACS continue to evolve at a rapid pace driven by a multitude of large-scale randomized controlled trials. Thus, clinicians are frequently faced with the problem of determining which drug or therapeutic strategy will achieve the best results.

Two weeks before admission, she started to exhibit atypical behaviors, such as walking about her house undressed. The patient denied fever, headaches, seizures, nuchal rigidity, visual changes, weakness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and bowel or bladder incontinence. She was evaluated at another institution for her symptoms about 2 weeks before. Work-up at that time included electroencephalography, which showed generalized slowing consistent with metabolic encephalopathy. The patient received a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin for delirium that was presumed to be secondary to a urinary tract infection. Her symptoms did not improve with antibiotic therapy, so she presented to our institution for further evaluation.\n\n【1】The patient had a long-standing history of bipolar disorder and anxiety treated by a psychiatrist. Her medications included divalproex, lithium, quetiapine, fluphenazine, and clonazepam. Her psychiatric medications had not changed recently, and her mood disorder had been stable for many years. Her other medication was tolterodine, which she had been using for urinary incontinence. The patient and her husband owned a small business, and she had been in charge of the accounting up until 2 months before hospital admission. She smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily for many years and denied alcohol consumption or drug abuse.\n\n【2】Physical examination revealed an elderly woman in no acute distress. She was somnolent but arousable and followed instructions. Her affect was flat, and language was remarkable for simple 1-word answers. Her vital signs and general physical examination findings were normal. Neurologic examination revealed an altered mental status with deficits in attention, learning, and recall. She scored 24 out of 38 points on the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, with deficits in attention, learning, and recall. Cranial nerves and motor and sensory functions were normal. Reflexes were symmetric, and plantar response was flexor. The patient's gait was normal, and she had no ataxia.\n\n【3】Chest radiography and electrocardiography performed on admission were unremarkable. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the head revealed several small hypodense areas in periventricular white matter consistent with small vessel disease. Laboratory studies (reference ranges provided parenthetically) were remarkable for a hemoglobin of 9 g/dL (12.0-15.5 g/dL) and a mean corpuscular volume of 81 fL (81.6-98.3 fL). Levels of electrolytes, blood glucose, and serum creatinine, transaminases, ammonia, lithium, and valproic acid were within normal or therapeutic range, as were findings on arterial blood gas analysis, urinalysis, and urine drug screening.\n\n【4】*   1.\n\n【5】    **_Which one of the following is the most likely cause of the patient's delirium?_**\n\n【6】    *   a.\n\n【7】        _Bacterial meningitis_\n\n【8】    *   b.\n\n【9】        _Viral encephalitis_\n\n【10】    *   c.\n\n【11】        _Metabolic encephalopathy_\n\n【12】    *   d.\n\n【13】        _Medication-induced delirium_\n\n【14】    *   e.\n\n【15】        _Subdural hematoma_\n\n【16】In reviews of the presentation of bacterial meningitis, approximately 99% to 100% of affected patients present with at least 1 of the following: fever, neck stiffness, or change in mental status.\n\n【17】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【18】Acute bacterial meningitis in adults: a review of 493 episodes.\n\n【19】Our patient's 1-month history of delirium without fever or meningeal signs argues against the typical presentation of bacterial meningitis. Numerous viral agents can cause an encephalitis or meningoencephalitis with varying clinical presentation, including herpes simplex virus, enteroviruses, echoviruses, coxsackieviruses, mumps, human immunodeficiency virus, and arboviruses. Affected patients may exhibit a maculopapular exanthem, grouped dermal vesicles, flaccid paralysis, fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, or mental status changes. Our patient's prolonged duration of delirium in the absence of fever and headaches and without focal neurologic findings on examination was not consistent with viral encephalitis. A variety of conditions can cause a metabolic encephalopathy, including hepatic or renal impairment and endocrinopathies. Physical examination findings and laboratory evaluation in our patient were not consistent with a hepatic or uremic encephalopathy. Delirium is caused by medications in up to 30% of all cases.\n\n【20】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【21】Drug-induced delirium: diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【22】Our patient was taking multiple psychiatric medications. The combination of lithium with dopamine antagonists such as fluphenazine has been reported to cause weakness, dyskinesias, and encephalopathy.\n\n【23】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【24】Delirium induced by lithium and risperidone combination \\[letter\\].\n\n【25】The patient's benzodiazepine and anticholinergic agent could also have contributed to her altered mental status. Thus, a careful review of medications is essential in evaluating delirium for all patients. Subdural hematoma was unlikely in this patient given the findings on CT of the head.\n\n【26】Careful review of the patient's records showed no recent changes in her psychiatric medications and a mood disorder that had been stable for many years. Additional history indicated exposure to mosquitoes and tick bites several months earlier. The patient had always lived in the Midwest in a farmhouse adjacent to a large forest. Drinking water was obtained from a home well. She had no remarkable travel history. The patient owned a cat but denied recent cat scratches.\n\n【27】A lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed an opening pressure of 14 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O, 1 nucleated cell/mL, a glucose level of 51 mg/dL (serum glucose, 91 mg/dL), and a protein level of 54 mg/dL (14-45 mg/dL). Cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain, bacterial cultures, and polymerase chain reaction were negative for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella zoster virus. Urine and blood cultures showed no growth. Morning cortisol, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine, serum folate, and vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> levels were within normal limits. Over the next several days, the patient's quetiapine, clonazepam, fluphenazine, and tolterodine were tapered and discontinued. Her mental status, however, showed little improvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed mild to moderate cortical atrophy along with periventricular and subcortical white matter changes consistent with small vessel disease. No evidence of recent infarction was seen.\n\n【28】*   2.\n\n【29】    **_Which one of the following diagnostic tests would be least appropriate in this patient?_**\n\n【30】    *   a.\n\n【31】        _Cerebrospinal fluid arbovirus antibody analysis_\n\n【32】    *   b.\n\n【33】        Borrelia burgdorferi _serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with CSF antibody analysis_\n\n【34】    *   c.\n\n【35】        Bartonella henselae _antibody analysis_\n\n【36】    *   d.\n\n【37】        _Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test_\n\n【38】    *   e.\n\n【39】        _Urine arsenic assay_\n\n【40】Findings on CSF analysis are not suggestive of viral meningitis. However, cases have been documented to occur with normal CSF findings.\n\n【41】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【42】Normal CSF in bacterial meningitis.\n\n【43】Arboviral infections of the central nervous system can present as meningitis, meningoencephalitis, or encephalitis and should remain in the differential diagnosis for this patient given her history of exposure. Lyme meningitis is usually associated with a CSF pleocytosis and often occurs in late summer to fall. The onset of neuroborreliosis, however, is variable and occasionally includes the triad of meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculitis. Lyme and Bartonella encephalitis should be considered given the history of exposure to tick bite and cat. Neurosyphilis, which can manifest as personality changes in addition to hyperreflexia, paresthesias, and tabes dorsalis, should be evaluated in this patient. Heavy metal toxicity can occur from contaminated well water. However, the neurologic symptoms of long-term arsenic poisoning are primarily limited to polyneuropathy with only very rare cases of encephalitis among individuals with an occupational exposure to arsenic,\n\n【44】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【45】Encephalopathy: an uncommon manifestation of arsenic poisoning?\n\n【46】making this the least likely answer.\n\n【47】During her hospital stay, the patient's mental status continued to wax and wane. Later, she developed diffuse muscle weakness that was not present on admission. Physical examination confirmed the presence of proximal muscle weakness. Because of the patient's variable mental condition, it could not be determined whether the muscle weakness was secondary to pain.\n\n【48】*   3.\n\n【49】    **_Which one of the following diagnostic approaches would be the most appropriate next step in evaluating the patient's delirium?_**\n\n【50】    *   a.\n\n【51】        _Electromyography_\n\n【52】    *   b.\n\n【53】        _Vastus lateralis muscle biopsy_\n\n【54】    *   c.\n\n【55】        _Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis_\n\n【56】    *   d.\n\n【57】        _Initiation of antidelirium reorientation techniques_\n\n【58】    *   e.\n\n【59】        _Measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatinine kinase levels_\n\n【60】Electromyography may be useful for evaluating proximal muscle weakness or the presence of peripheral neuropathy. However, determining the presence of a neuropathy may not elucidate the etiology behind the patient's presenting symptom of confusion. Moreover, the patient's symptoms had been present only a few days, making it too early in the patient's course to see typical changes of most neuromuscular diseases on electromyography. Clinical suspicion of myopathy is an indication for muscle biopsy. Both polymyositis and dermatomyositis could present with proximal muscle weakness in patients of this age. However, preliminary studies such as serum creatinine kinase measurement and electromyography should be performed before initiating this relatively invasive procedure. Moreover, the patient's mental status changes are inconsistent with the presentation of most leading causes of myopathy. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis could be useful in locating occult malignancy or infection. However, the lack of evidence of a mass on MRI of the head argues against metastatic spread to the brain. Moreover, the patient had no fever, leukocytosis, or localizing history and physical examination findings to suggest hidden infection.\n\n【61】Reorientation techniques are important in the treatment of delirium, particularly in patients with prolonged hospitalizations and disrupted sleep/wake cycles. Although such techniques should certainly be considered for this patient, it is unlikely that delirium secondary to unfamiliar environment explains the patient's presentation. Her symptoms began before her hospitalization, and her proximal muscle weakness suggests an underlying etiology that merits investigation. The course of the patient's delirium in combination with progressive systemic symptoms such as muscle weakness should prompt an evaluation for vasculitis. Thus, checking serum markers of inflammation would be most appropriate. Measurement of creatinine kinase is appropriate in the evaluation of proximal muscle weakness.\n\n【62】During the hospital stay, the patient became increasingly obtunded. Although she had run a home business in the past, she could no longer perform simple arithmetic calculations nor was she aware of her name or current location. Her upper and lower extremity weakness persisted, and she required moderate assistance in sitting from a supine position. She had symptoms of jaw claudication. Serum anti-nuclear antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and creatine kinase levels were normal. The patient had an elevated serum ESR (106 mm/1 h \\[0-29 mm/1 h\\]) and CRP level (147 mg/L \\[<8.0 mg/L\\]). Electroencephalography was performed to reevaluate the generalized slowing seen on her outside study. Diffuse slowing of 6 to 7 Hz with intermittent diffuse delta waves was seen with maximal distribution over the bitemporal head regions.\n\n【63】*   4.\n\n【64】    **_Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step?_**\n\n【65】    *   a.\n\n【66】        _Empiric corticosteroids and temporal artery biopsy_\n\n【67】    *   b.\n\n【68】        _Cerebral angiography_\n\n【69】    *   c.\n\n【70】        _Paraneoplastic CSF analysis_\n\n【71】    *   d.\n\n【72】        _Positron emission tomography/single-photon emission computed tomography of the brain_\n\n【73】    *   e.\n\n【74】        _Psychiatric evaluation for pseudodementia_\n\n【75】Although a rare manifestation, giant cell arteritis (GCA) can present with mental status changes. Jaw claudication can also be a presenting symptom with GCA. Studies indicate that patients with GCA who have an ESR greater than 100 mm/1h have constitutional symptoms more often than visual symptoms.\n\n【76】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【77】Giant cell arteritis: laboratory tests at the test of diagnosis in a series of 240 patients.\n\n【78】Investigation of GCA along with empiric corticosteroid treatment should take place before other diagnoses are pursued. Although a primary central nervous system vasculitis is a possibility, the combination of a normal CSF study and MRI of the head makes this extremely unlikely.\n\n【79】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【80】Vasculitis in the central nervous system.\n\n【81】As such, cerebral angiography is unlikely to provide useful information. If paraneoplastic causes of altered mental status were in the differential diagnosis, a work-up for neoplasm should be performed before a paraneoplastic analysis of CSF. Little in the patient's history and findings on imaging studies suggested an active neoplasm. Positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography of the brain show promise for earlier detection of Alzheimer disease. However, the course of the patient's presentation and her elevated inflammatory markers should prompt evaluation of other etiologies before investigating the generally more slowly developing neurodegenerative diseases. Likewise, the elevated ESR suggests an organic cause for her symptoms that should be evaluated before pursuing a diagnosis of pseudodementia.\n\n【82】The patient denied any headaches or visual changes. Examination of the temporal region revealed no arterial tenderness, and temporal pulses were normal. A biopsy was performed on the right temporal artery, and the pathology showed vascular inflammation consistent with GCA.\n\n【83】*   5.\n\n【84】    **_Which one of the following is not part of the management plan for this patient?_**\n\n【85】    *   a.\n\n【86】        _Daily prednisone treatment_\n\n【87】    *   b.\n\n【88】        _Aspirin, 81 mg/d_\n\n【89】    *   c.\n\n【90】        _Periodic ESR monitoring_\n\n【91】    *   d.\n\n【92】        _Annual chest radiography_\n\n【93】    *   e.\n\n【94】        _Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin_\n\n【95】Prednisone (40-60 mg/d) is the first-line therapy for GCA. Initiation of corticosteroid therapy is encouraged before obtaining the confirmatory biopsy specimen to prevent visual complications. The incidence of visual loss after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy is approximately 6%.\n\n【96】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【97】Visual prognosis in giant cell arteritis.\n\n【98】Without corticosteroids, 50% of patients with GCA experience visual changes, and 10% to 50% can have a degree of visual loss. In retrospective studies, the use of daily aspirin in patients with GCA was associated with a lower incidence of cerebrovascular ischemic events.\n\n【99】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【100】Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients with giant cell arteritis.\n\n【101】Remission and relapse of GCA after the initiation of treatment is gauged symptomatically and by monitoring ESR. In approximately 15% of GCA cases, the aorta and aortic root are involved, and the condition itself is associated with the development of thoracic aortic aneurysms.\n\n【102】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【103】Giant cell arteritis: diagnosis, management, and cardiovascular implications.\n\n【104】To that end, yearly monitoring with chest radiography is recommended. Some physicians choose to monitor such cases with serial CT of the chest. The use of warfarin was not associated with a significantly decreased incidence of ischemic cerebrovascular events compared with daily aspirin.\n\n【105】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【106】Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients with giant cell arteritis.\n\n【107】The patient began taking 60 mg/d of prednisone and was discharged to a rehabilitation facility. Her delirium and muscle weakness improved during the next month. On follow-up examination 3 months later, the patient was noted to be much more alert, conversant, and cognizant on examination than during her previous admission. She was able to give a concise history. Moreover, she had no visual deficits or weakness. Her ESR and CRP levels had returned to normal range.\n\n【108】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【109】Giant cell arteritis is a chronic vasculitis of medium and large vessels. It is commonly seen in individuals older than 50 years and of Scandinavian descent. An epidemiological study in Olmsted County revealed an annual incidence of 1 in 4200 people older than 60 years.\n\n【110】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【111】The incidence of giant cell arteritis in Olmsted County, Minnesota: apparent fluctuations in a cyclic pattern.\n\n【112】The classic presentation of GCA is fever and headache with localization to the temporal region in a patient older than 50 years. Physicians are taught to quickly recognize this typical pattern and intervene to prevent the dreaded complication of vision loss. However, the clinician should also be aware of atypical presentations. In an evaluation of 463 patients with GCA presenting to Mayo Clinic, 2 had confirmed intracranial arterial involvement.\n\n【113】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【114】Giant cell arteritis: involvement of intracranial arteries.\n\n【115】The symptoms of these 2 patients included progressive deterioration of memory, stupor, confusion, and extremity weakness.\n\n【116】Laboratory evaluation for GCA usually reveals a substantially elevated ESR; normochromic, normocytic anemia; and a mild leukocytosis. The criterion standard for diagnosing GCA remains temporal artery biopsy, which typically reveals vasculitic changes with multinucleated giant cells in the arterial wall, predominantly in the media near the internal elastic lamina. However, treatment should not be delayed in the setting of high clinical suspicion. The diagnosis can still be made on the basis of pathologic findings after several days of treatment with corticosteroids. In patients with high clinical suspicion of GCA and negative findings on unilateral temporal artery biopsy, a biopsy of the contralateral side should be performed. Pathologic changes can be focal, with areas of normal vessel anatomy within wider areas of vasculitic changes, necessitating resections at least 2.5 cm in length for adequate evaluation.\n\n【117】Corticosteroid therapy remains the standard treatment for GCA. In a widely used regimen, prednisone therapy is initiated at 40 to 60 mg/d, and the dose is gradually tapered on the basis of the clinical condition and the level of inflammatory markers. Treatment generally needs to be continued for 2 years on the basis of improvement in constitutional symptoms, vascular symptoms, and ESR. Adverse effects of long-term corticosteroid treatment, such as hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of infections, need to be taken into consideration. To decrease unwarranted adverse effects, corticosteroid-sparing agents such as methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, and anti—tumor necrosis factor α monoclonal antibody therapy are occasionally used. Daily low-dose aspirin has been suggested to decrease the incidence of cranial ischemic events.\n\n【118】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【119】Antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in patients with giant cell arteritis.\n\n【120】Yearly chest radiography is also recommended to monitor for the development of a thoracic aortic aneurysm.\n\n【121】Giant cell arteritis is the most common systemic vasculitis affecting elderly patients in Western countries. The classic presentation of GCA with headache and visual symptoms is well recognized, but it is also important to make the diagnosis when patients present with atypical symptoms such as those of our patient. Although atypical symptoms are rare, recognizing and treating patients with atypical presentations can lead to a substantial decrease in morbidity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

An important component of the classification scheme is an estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Stages 1 and 2 (mild CKD) are determined by evidence of kidney damage for 3 months or more, defined as structural or functional abnormalities of the kidney manifest on kidney biopsy, on imaging studies, or by abnormalities of the composition of the blood or urine (albuminuria), accompanied by normal or mildly reduced GFR (stage 1, GFR ≥90 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ; stage 2, GFR 60-89 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ). Stages 3 through 5 represent more advanced disease (moderate to severe CKD) and are determined solely by a GFR lower than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> for 3 months or more without the requirement of other findings of kidney damage (stage 3, GFR 30-59 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ; stage 4, GFR 15-29 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ; stage 5, GFR <15 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ).\n\n【17】The validity of this classification is supported by a correlation of declining estimated GFR (eGFR) with increasing anemia, disturbances of calcium-phosphorus metabolism, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and total mortality.\n\n【18】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【19】Longitudinal follow-up and outcomes among a population with chronic kidney disease in a large managed care organization.\n\n【20】Indeed, most patients with reduced renal function will die of other causes before they progress to the need for renal replacement therapy.

The most accurate reference standards for GFR determination are measurement of inulin or iothalamate clearance.

Higher serum creatinine levels are associated with black race, muscular body habitus, and a high-protein diet. To complicate matters further, the level of serum creatinine is influenced by renal tubular secretion, which increases as renal function declines. As a result, any given serum creatinine level can be associated with widely different values of GFR. For example, in an elderly woman with reduced muscle mass, a serum creatinine level well within the normal range can be associated with a reduced GFR. Conversely, in a young man with a muscular body habitus, a serum creatinine level in the upper end of the normal range can be associated with a normal GFR.\n\n【44】To more accurately predict GFR, serum creatinine has been incorporated into equations that take into account variables of age, sex, race, and body size (major determinants of variation in muscle mass) to calculate an eGFR. The Cockcroft-Gault and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equations are most commonly used in clinical practice.\n\n【45】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【46】Prediction of creatinine clearance from serum creatinine.\n\n【47】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【48】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【49】A more accurate method to estimate glomerular filtration rate from serum creatinine: a new prediction equation.\n\n【50】Importantly, both equations were derived from population samples with known kidney disease. Few data address serum creatinine in healthy populations. Current NKF guidelines recommend that clinical laboratories use these equations to report eGFR when serum creatinine is measured, specifically with the goal to identify patients with CKD. Although using these tools to calculate eGFR may provide benefit, several caveats are in order. One of these derives from the fact that creatinine measurements are not standardized across laboratories.\n\n【51】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【52】The importance of standardization of creatinine in the implementation of guidelines and recommendations for CKD: implications for CKD management programmes.\n\n【53】Serum creatinine measurements can differ by up to 0.3 mg/dL between laboratories. When incorporated into current estimating equations, such differences in measured creatinine can lead to major differences in eGFR. At a minimum, sensible application of national guidelines requires standardization of serum creatinine measurement. Also, eGFR from these equations is based on average differences in muscle mass attributable to differences in age, sex, and race. Thus, eGFR will be less accurate in patients with unusually high (underestimated true GFR) or low (overestimated true GFR) muscle mass or unusual diets (eg, vegetarian diet is associated with overestimation of true GFR). Importantly, the error in eGFR increases at higher levels of GFR. Consequently, current estimating equations do not report specific values higher than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> . Thus, clinically relevant changes in GFR occurring above this level will not be identified, and the estimating equations cannot be used to distinguish stage 1 from stage 2 CKD.\n\n【54】The study by Rule et al identifies another important limitation of current estimating equations. They applied previous GFR estimating equations derived separately from a CKD sample, a healthy sample, and a combined sample of CKD and healthy patients to calculate eGFR in a population-based sample of adults aged 45 years and older from Olmsted County, Minnesota. They observed that different estimating equations yielded widely different prevalence estimates for stage 3 or higher CKD, ranging from 12% with the equation derived from CKD patients to 0.2% with the equation derived from healthy patients. Previous studies by Rule and others have shown that current estimating equations derived from samples of patients with CKD underestimate GFR in healthy persons with high-normal creatinine levels.\n\n【55】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【56】Using serum creatinine to estimate glomerular filtration rate: accuracy in good health and in chronic kidney disease.\n\n【57】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【58】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【59】Performance of the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease and Cockcroft-Gault equations in the estimation of GFR in health and in chronic kidney disease.\n\n【60】Thus, when applied to the general population consisting of a mixture of healthy and CKD patients, the equations overestimate CKD prevalence. As pointed out by Rule et al, this feature has important implications for estimating CKD prevalence in population studies and may lead to biased associations of risk factors for CKD. For clinical care, routine use of these equations in populations from general clinics may lead to the incorrect diagnosis of CKD in many healthy patients. Rule et al suggest that identification of CKD may be more appropriately determined by observing serum creatinine levels higher than the upper limit (97.5 percentile) of the normal range for sex and race and limiting the use of GFR estimating equations to stage patients after the diagnosis of CKD has been established. They argue that such an approach will reduce the number of healthy patients incorrectly diagnosed with CKD (high specificity), albeit at the expense of underdiagnosing CKD, particularly in older patients or those with low muscle mass for their age, sex, or race (low sensitivity). This, of course, was the original problem that led to the development of GFR estimating equations. Taken together, current data support the practice of reporting eGFR to alert the clinician to the possible presence of reduced renal function not obvious from the serum creatinine level. This practice may avoid unnecessary exposure to potential nephrotoxins or overdosing of drugs that rely on the kidney for elimination. Recognizing the importance of this clinical issue, the National Institutes of Health has sponsored a collaborative study to further develop and validate GFR estimating equations in an effort to resolve limitations associated with equations currently being applied in clinical practice and research. In the meantime, clinicians must be vigilant in their search for CKD. The measurement of serum creatinine and the reporting of eGFR should be considered in the context of a thorough history, physical examination, and assessment of the urine, including assessment for proteinuria. Limitations of the application of eGFR should be understood.\n\n【61】As presented in the review by Sprangers et al, treatment of CKD must be timely and not delayed by limited referral patterns. The diagnosis of CKD involves consideration of reversible causes (obstruction, infection, drugs) and implementation of specific therapies designed to slow progression and lower CVD risk. Using the current classification scheme, a significant fraction of CKD occurs in older persons with stable but reduced GFR in the absence of other findings of renal injury (proteinuria). Whether these patients are at high risk for future kidney failure and would benefit from aggressive strategies to slow progression is unknown.\n\n【62】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【63】Progression of kidney dysfunction in the community-dwelling elderly.\n\n【64】The burden of caring for CKD patients will continue to rest primarily on the shoulders of primary care physicians, especially for patients with stages 1 through 3 disease. Their large numbers alone would overwhelm nephrologists in current practice. However, Sprangers et al argue that timely referral of patients with stage 4 or 5 CKD will lead to better patient outcomes. In some patients (15%-20%), kidney disease progresses rapidly and may not be evident in time to be treated optimally. However, practice reviews indicate that nearly 40% of “late referrals” (defined as failure to be seen by nephrology subspecialists until 1-6 months before the need to start dialysis) may derive from patient-related issues, and an additional 40% may relate to reluctance to refer or lack of awareness of the diagnosis on the part of physicians. The latter may be partly due to misinterpretation of serum creatinine values. In some patients (nearly 5%), Sprangers et al suggest that progression could be prevented. In many other patients, adverse outcomes including CVD complications and suboptimal planning for renal replacement therapy could be prevented. They suggest that multidisciplinary nephrology clinics that employ nurse specialists, dietitians, and social workers may provide optimum care. It is hoped that the NKF initiative will improve physician recognition of CKD and its severity, reducing the current high rates of late referral for specialist care with its resultant increase in morbidity.\n\n【65】Although the exact prevalence of CKD remains uncertain, it clearly is an increasingly common clinical problem. The impact of early detection and targeted treatment strategies to lessen morbidity, mortality, and progression to kidney failure is currently unknown but worthy of continued efforts to define.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Her medical comorbidities included nicotine dependence with a 20-pack-year smoking history, common variable immune deficiency, quiescent multiple sclerosis not receiving immunomodulatory therapy, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, hypertension, and fibromyalgia. Medications at the time of presentation were nortriptyline, cyclobenzaprine, aspirin, and duloxetine. She endorsed use of e-cigarette or vaping products that contained marijuana; other drug use was denied. Because of a plumbing issue at home, the patient and her partner had been staying in a hotel for 4 days before presentation, where they had been using the swimming pool and hot tub. The patient had received multiple cat bites on her forearms 1 week earlier; she had no other animal exposures. She lived in Minnesota and reported no travel outside the region. The patient had not received a vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The patient’s partner was experiencing similar symptoms, and she denied other sick contacts.\n\n【1】In the ED, the patient was alert and oriented but appeared tired and diaphoretic. At the time of presentation, the respiratory rate was 17 breaths/min; blood pressure, 165/82 mm Hg; heart rate, 97 beats/min; oxygen saturation, 97% on room air; and temperature, 36.0 °C. Heart rhythm was regular with no murmur appreciated; there was no lower extremity edema. Vesicular breathing was appreciated bilaterally with no adventitious breath sounds. There was no appreciable supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy. Abdomen was soft and nontender. There was no joint swelling or tenderness and no motor or sensory abnormalities. Healing excoriations were noted on the forearms bilaterally with no surrounding erythema. A complete blood count was notable for the following (normal ranges shown parenthetically): leukocytosis of 22.5×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L ((3.4 to 9.6)×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) and a neutrophilia of 19.12×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L ((1.6 to 6.5)×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). A basic metabolic profile was notable only for a mild hypokalemia of 3.3 mmol/L (3.6 to 5.2 mmol/L). Nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing was negative for SARS-CoV-2. A chest radiograph revealed subtle interstitial opacities in the mid and lower lung fields bilaterally without evidence of consolidation.\n\n【2】*   1.\n\n【3】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _best_ next step in the management of this patient?**\n\n【4】    *   a.\n\n【5】        Retest for SARS-CoV-2 infection\n\n【6】    *   b.\n\n【7】        Prescribe a corticosteroid for suspected e-cigarette or vaping use–associated lung injury\n\n【8】    *   c.\n\n【9】        Prescribe a 5-day course of levofloxacin with close outpatient follow-up\n\n【10】    *   d.\n\n【11】        Conservative treatment with close outpatient follow-up\n\n【12】    *   e.\n\n【13】        Admit patient for further evaluation\n\n【14】Although a negative nasopharyngeal PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 does not rule out coronavirus disease 2019, it has a high sensitivity. Although laboratory and radiographic findings associated with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia can vary substantially, profound neutrophilia without lymphopenia is unusual and peripheral opacities are a more common pattern on chest radiography. E-cigarette or vaping use–associated lung injury is a possibility, but corticosteroids should be reserved for severe cases and withheld until community-acquired pneumonia has been ruled out. The salient features in this case include fever, cough, interstitial opacities on chest imaging, possible environmental exposures, and a close contact with similar symptoms, concerning for pneumonia as the infectious syndrome. Levofloxacin would be an appropriate choice in this instance, providing coverage for both typical and atypical respiratory pathogens. Although viral pneumonia is a possibility, neutrophilia and imaging changes raise concern for bacterial infection and antibiotic therapy is indicated. Inpatient care should be reserved for patients with increased work of breathing, evidence of hemodynamic instability, or altered mental status; and scoring tools such as the pneumonia severity index or CURB-65 can guide the initial site of treatment. On the basis of the data provided, the CURB-65 score is zero and inpatient treatment is not indicated at this time.\n\n【15】The patient was diagnosed as having a viral infection and discharged from the ED without antibiotics, with recommendations to follow up with her primary care provider. Six days later, she was found unresponsive at home and brought to the ED by family for further assessment. During this time frame, her partner had died of respiratory illness. At this presentation, her initial blood pressure was 87/34 mm Hg; heart rate, 90 beats/min; respiratory rate, 37 breaths/min; oxygen saturation, 70% on room air; and temperature, 35.1 °C. Laboratory evaluation was notable for a hemoglobin level of 12.1 mg/dL (11.6 to 15 mg/dL); platelet count, 539×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L ((157 to 371)×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L); and leukocyte count, 34.0×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L ((3.4 to 9.6)×10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with neutrophilia. The metabolic panel revealed a sodium level of 129 mmol/L (135 to 145 mmol/L); potassium level, 3.4 mmol/L (3.6 to 5.2 mmol/L); chloride level, 90 mmol/L (98 to 107 mmol/L); bicarbonate level, 12 mmol/L (22 to 29 mmol/L); and creatinine level, 3.80 mg/dL (0.74 to 1.35 mg/dL). The hepatic function panel revealed a total bilirubin level of 1.8 mg/dL (<1.2 mg/dL); alanine aminotransferase level, 384 U/L (7-25 U/L); and aspartate aminotransferase level, 466 U/L (8 to 33 U/L). Repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing was negative. Computed tomography of the chest revealed diffuse bilateral nodular pulmonary opacities.\n\n【16】*   2.\n\n【17】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ diagnosis?**\n\n【18】    *   a.\n\n【19】        Cat scratch disease\n\n【20】    *   b.\n\n【21】        Influenza virus\n\n【22】    *   c.\n\n【23】        Coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia\n\n【24】    *   d.\n\n【25】        Fungal pneumonia\n\n【26】    *   e.\n\n【27】        Legionnaires disease\n\n【28】The patient has returned to the ED with a clinical syndrome of septic shock secondary to a lower respiratory tract infection. Cat scratch disease due to infection by _Bartonella henselae_ typically presents as localized cutaneous erythema near the site of a scratch. Visceral organ involvement is generally limited to the liver and spleen. Although there is a positive exposure history with evidence of bite marks on physical examination, this diagnosis does not fit with her current clinical presentation. The 4 alternative diagnoses may all present as pneumonia. Influenza is very unlikely, given the patient presented during the summertime and has no documented history of travel to the southern hemisphere. Coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia should be considered in the differential, but the patient now has had 2 negative PCR tests. Both Legionnaires disease and pneumonia caused by endemic fungi ( _Histoplasma_ sp and _Blastomyces_ sp) may have similar radiologic features. In this case, the rapid progression to septic shock, supportive laboratory features (hyponatremia and elevated transaminase levels), and a family member with similar symptoms and environmental exposures (hot tub and swimming pool) are most suggestive of Legionnaires disease.\n\n【29】The patient was emergently intubated and admitted to the medical intensive care unit.\n\n【30】*   3.\n\n【31】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _best_ approach to confirm the diagnosis in this patient?**\n\n【32】    *   a.\n\n【33】        Obtain 2 sets of blood cultures\n\n【34】    *   b.\n\n【35】        Obtain urine for antigen testing\n\n【36】    *   c.\n\n【37】        Obtain upper respiratory samples for culture\n\n【38】    *   d.\n\n【39】        Obtain upper respiratory samples for PCR testing\n\n【40】    *   e.\n\n【41】        Perform bronchoalveolar lavage with PCR testing\n\n【42】The yield of blood cultures for the detection of _Legionella_ sp is low, with growth of the organism often failing to exceed the threshold for detection using routine methods.\n\n【43】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【44】Diagnosis of _Legionella_ infection.\n\n【45】Urinary antigen testing (UAT) is widely available, and results can be obtained rapidly.

Legionnaires disease is caused by _Legionella_ sp, an aerobic gram-negative bacillus.

Participants were classified by self-reported alcohol consumption status (nondrinkers, moderate drinkers \\[0 to 2 drinks per day\\], and heavy drinkers \\[>2 drinks per day\\]). The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of hepatic steatosis, identified by _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision_ code and confirmed with imaging. The secondary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. Multivariate Cox regression analysis determined the impact of alcohol consumption stratified by BMI on outcomes compared with nondrinkers.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The cohort (mean ± SD age, 55.8±16.9 years; 63.8% female; mean ± SD BMI, 28.8±6.1 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) of 18,506 participants included 3657 (19.8%) nondrinkers, 14,236 (76.9%) moderate drinkers, and 613 (3.3%) heavy drinkers at enrollment. After a median follow-up of 5.8 years (interquartile range, 3.8 to 7.2 years), 684 participants had development of hepatic steatosis and 968 died. In moderate drinkers, the risk of hepatic steatosis development was high in the obese group (adjusted hazard ratio \\[AHR\\], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.67), insignificant in the overweight group (AHR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.26), and decreased in the normal-BMI group (AHR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.90).

We aimed to investigate whether long-term change in CRF, as assessed by the gold standard method of respiratory gas exchange during exercise, is associated with all-cause mortality. A population-based sample of 579 men aged 42 to 60 years with no missing data at baseline examination (V1) and at reexamination at 11 years (V2) were included. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO <sub>2max </sub> ) was measured at both visits using respiratory gas exchange during maximal exercise testing, and the difference (ΔVO <sub>2max </sub> ) was calculated as VO <sub>2max </sub> (V2) − VO <sub>2max </sub> (V1). Deaths were ascertained annually using national death certificates during 15 years of follow-up after V2. The mean ΔVO <sub>2max </sub> was −5.2 mL/min\\*kg.

Unfortunately, provision of care for terminally ill patients is suboptimal. There are many new approaches to improving the skills of all physicians to fulfill the needs of patients, including better education for house staff, “train-the-trainers” programs for physicians in practice, research into methods of symptom control, and better access to established hospice programs. This review covers the history, current status, and practical suggestions for improving palliative care and hospice programs in primary care settings.\n\n【1】AMA ( American Medical Association )\n\n【2】Palliative medicine is defined by the World Health Organization as the “study and management of patients with active, progressive, far-advanced disease for whom the prognosis is limited and the focus of care is the quality of life.”\n\n【3】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【4】*   World Health Organization\n\n【5】Cancer pain relief and palliative care: report of a WHO Expert Committee.\n\n【6】Despite sophisticated medical technology, there is concern that dying patients are not receiving the quality of care they deserve.\n\n【7】Palliative care and hospice programs are points on a continuum of comprehensive patient care. Hospice care is the final chapter of palliative medicine. In the United States, palliative care teams are primarily hospital based; hospice programs may include outpatient and inpatient services and occasionally free-standing facilities for terminal patient care. Medicare provides for a hospice benefit if the patient is eligible for Medicare, has a terminal illness with a life expectancy of 6 months or less, and has given informed consent.\n\n【8】History\n-------\n\n【9】Dame Cecily Saunders is credited with starting the first formal hospice program at St Christopher's in London in 1967. Florence S. Wald developed the first US home-based hospice program in 1977. Dr Elizabeth Kubler-Ross raised awareness of the steps of death and dying that patients experience and advocated the home, rather than the intensive care unit, as the place for a “good death.”\n\n【10】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【11】The evolution of hospice and palliative medicine.\n\n【12】Since 1982, Congress has authorized a Medicare-approved hospice benefit. Many private insurers provide for some form of hospice benefit, with criteria similar to those for Medicare.\n\n【13】In 1990, Congress passed the Patient Self-Determination Act to encourage advanced directives. Despite campaigns to promote this, only 15% to 20% of patients execute such a document.\n\n【14】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【15】Advance directive.\n\n【16】Although the overwhelming preference of many severely ill patients is to die at home, most die in a hospital. According to 1 study, 81% of patients stated a clear preference for dying at home, but 56% died in a hospital.\n\n【17】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【18】Death and Dying in America: Too Much Technology, Too Little Care. Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , Princeton, NJ May 1998\n\n【19】Because of these statistics, the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation sought to define and correct problems in the care of patients approaching death. Phase 1 of that project detailed shortcomings in the care of seriously ill hospitalized patients. The phase 2 intervention was designed to address these deficiencies by providing physicians with accurate predictive information on future functional ability, survival probability for each day up to 6 months, and patient preferences for end-of-life care. Unfortunately, the intervention did not work. The study concluded that enhanced opportunities for more patient physician communication about end-of-life choices and outcomes were unable to change established practices.\n\n【20】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【21】*   SUPPORT Principal Investigators\n\n【22】A controlled trial to improve care for seriously ill hospitalized patients: the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT).\n\n【23】New approaches are needed if progress is to be made.\n\n【24】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【25】Measuring quality of life in palliative care.\n\n【26】Physicians must be given fundamental skills in communications, ethical decision making, and palliative care. To meet this need, the American Medical Association (AMA) developed a new training module called Education for Physicians on End-of-Life Care (EPEC). Across the United States, the AMA has started “train-the-trainer” programs. For more information about EPEC, telephone the AMA at (312) 464–5000.\n\n【27】Approximately 89% of patients in US hospices have cancer. Therefore, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recently adopted recommendations about end-of-life care.\n\n【28】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【29】*   End-of-life initiative moves forward\n\n【30】Its recommendations included a need to remove economic barriers to care; to provide better education for physicians; to expand research in physical, psychological, and socioeconomic issues; to expand and support hospice programs; and to deal with the complexities of physician-assisted suicide on a case-by-case basis.\n\n【31】Palliative Medical Practice\n---------------------------\n\n【32】Palliative medicine has become a subspecialty within American medicine. Specialists in palliative care and hospice care should provide the leadership and quality research needed to advance this field.\n\n【33】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【34】A proposal to restructure hospital care for dying patients.\n\n【35】However, there is a critical need for _all physicians_ to become more skilled at meeting the palliative care needs of their patients, rather than relying on palliative care specialists and hospice groups.\n\n【36】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【37】*   World Health Organization\n\n【38】Cancer pain relief and palliative care: report of a WHO Expert Committee.\n\n【39】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【40】Palliative care in undergraduate medical education: status report and future directions.\n\n【41】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【42】SUPPORT Investigators. Perceptions by family members of the dying experience of older and seriously ill patients.\n\n【43】Primary care physicians understand that patients' needs are not only physical but also social, psychological, and spiritual. Often, physicians indicate that they do not offer palliative care or hospice services to patients earlier in the course of terminal care because they are afraid of “taking away the patient's hope.” The approach, however, must be to find ways to “reframe” the patient's hope from cure to a goal commensurate with their situation. Such efforts to reframe hope include helping patients achieve optimal pain control and control of other common preterminal symptoms so they can complete important life tasks. The role of the physician remains extremely important to the patient and family during this time and allows the primary care provider to redirect their hope to new goals.\n\n【44】Symptom Control\n---------------\n\n【45】Symptoms that require medical intervention near the end of life include pain (75%), dyspnea (70%), anorexia-cachexia (85%), constipation (65%), nausea-vomiting (68%), neurologic changes (10%), and psychological distress (50%). Some of these common symptoms and approaches to their relief are listed in Table 1 . Practical references for palliative symptom control include the _Primer of Palliative Care_ from the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine (Intellicard), _Symptom Management Algorithms for Palliative Care_ by Linda Wrede-Seamon, MD (Intellicard), and texts such as Berger, Portenoy, and Weissman's _Principles and Practice of Supportive Oncology_ (Lippincott-Raven).\n\n【46】Table 1 Symptom Management\n\n| Symptom | Treatment and dosage |\n| --- | --- |\n| Dyspnea | Morphine—oral, sublingual, or subcutaneous—10-30 mg every 4 h as neededMorphine sulfate, 10 mg/mL, plus dexamethasone, 8 mg/mL, in 100 mL of normal saline—2.5 mL via nebulizer as needed |\n| Anorexia | Megestrol acetate tablets—40-80 mg/dMegestrol acetate liquid—20 mL/d (40 mg/mL = 800 mg)Dronabinol—5-10 mg daily or twice daily (also for nausea) |\n| Obstipation | Lactulose—15-30 mL up to 3 times per day “Power pudding”—1 teaspoon each of applesauce, stewed prunes, prune juice, and bran cerealTherevac enema—3 mL |\n| Agitation | Lorazepam plus haloperidol—1-2 mg orally every 4 h as needed |\n\n【48】It is important to be proactive in anticipating symptom control needs. For example, an aggressive bowel regimen should be initiated to prevent obstipation when narcotics are instituted. Treatment of underlying depression, even reactive depression, can improve pain control substantially and affect overall quality of life.\n\n【49】Physicians have been criticized for not meeting the pain needs of patients. In 1990, the World Health Organization reiterated its “ladder approach” to pharmacological pain management.\n\n【50】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【51】*   World Health Organization\n\n【52】Cancer pain relief and palliative care: report of a WHO Expert Committee.\n\n【53】This approach suggests a progression in doses and classes of palliative agents, ranging from nonopioids (ie, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) to weak opioids to ultimately strong opioid analgesia. Codeine, oxycodone, and propoxyphene are considered weak opioids, whereas morphine and morphinelike drugs are classified as strong opioids. The ladder approach considers the use of adjuvant agents (such as acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) during each therapeutic step and the potential for combination therapy with nonopioid and opioid drugs . Morphine is an inexpensive drug that is available worldwide but remains underused, resulting in a large percentage of terminally ill patients dying with moderate to severe pain. In the United States, a wide variety of pain medications and routes of administration are available, and physicians should be able to tailor pain medications to the needs of each patient. The basic principles of pain management are listed in Table 2 .\n\n【54】Figure 1 The 3-step analgesic ladder developed by the World Health Organization (adapted from the World Health Organization1 with permission).\n\n【55】Table 2 Principles of Pain Management\n\n| Use a simple dosing scheduleUse noninvasive methods firstUse nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs first for mild to moderate painAdd an opioid or use a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory-opiod combination drug if pain increasesIncrease opioid strength or dose for moderate to severe painSchedule medications “by-the-clock”Provide medications for “breakthrough” painChange to parenteral schedule if patient unable to take orally administered drugs |\n| --- |\n\n【57】Some physicians have led a movement to have pain listed as the “fifth vital sign.” The use of any of several visual analog scales or simple pain intensity scales can make pain assessment a standard office procedure. Physicians have been troubled by a theory that states that pain medications are addictive and can be abused and therefore must be restricted; however, physicians are not taught effectively how to understand mechanisms and principles of pain management that may appropriately include the need for high doses of chronic pain relievers. Some states, such as New York, are passing laws to modify how prescriptions for narcotics must be written, but they still require reporting of prescriptions for controlled substances to the state health department. Legislation in Congress threatens to revoke a physician's license if the physician gives potentially fatal doses of narcotics. There is concern that such laws on prescribing will perpetuate undertreatment of pain. It is up to physicians to advocate for their patients, especially when patients are symptomatic at the end of life.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

An arthropod-borne virus named after the Zika forest in Uganda, it was first discovered in 1947. The virus caused only sporadic cases of Zika infection in Africa and Southeast Asia until 2007, when the first large outbreak occurred in the Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia. Another outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 was notable for being associated temporally with an increase in cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome. In 2015, the virus was first reported in Brazil and since then has spread explosively through several additional countries in South and Central America and the Caribbean. Simultaneously, several of these countries have seen a dramatic increase in the incidence of infants born with microcephaly. The rapid spread of Zika virus through the Americas, together with the association of infection with microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome, has resulted in the World Health Organization declaring a public health emergency. Zika virus has the potential to spread to new areas where the _Aedes_ mosquito vector is present and therefore presents a risk to the United States.

Both _Aedes aegypti_ (confined to tropical and subtropical regions) and _Aedes albopictus_ (found in temperate regions in addition to tropical and subtropical areas) are capable of transmitting Zika virus and have been implicated in outbreaks of Zika virus. Both _Aedes_ species are present in the United States. _Aedes albopictus_ is of particular concern because it has a much wider range than _A aegypti_ . It was originally imported from Southeast Asia and has been remarkably adaptable to cooler climates. _Aedes albopictus_ is now firmly established in several states in the United States.\n\n【41】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【42】Climate change and range expansion of the Asian tiger mosquito ( _Aedes albopictus_ ) in Northeastern USA: implications for public health practitioners.\n\n【43】It is an aggressive daytime biter and thrives in densely populated urban environments.

Mosquito populations may be detected in areas not shaded on this map, and may not be consistently found in all shaded areas.\n\n【45】From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n【46】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【47】Other modes of transmission are possible, but it is unclear how much of a role they play in propagating outbreaks. Sexual transmission of Zika virus was first reported in 2011.\n\n【48】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【49】Probable non-vector-borne transmission of Zika virus, Colorado, USA.\n\n【50】An American researcher acquired Zika virus in Senegal, became ill after returning home to Colorado, and transmitted the infection to his wife who had not traveled outside the United States. There have been 2 lab-confirmed cases of sexual transmission of Zika virus in the US during the current Zika outbreak; several additional cases are under investigation.\n\n【51】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【52】The virus was first isolated from sperm during the Polynesian outbreak.\n\n【53】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【54】Potential sexual transmission of Zika virus.\n\n【55】It is not known how long the virus persists in sperm or whether asymptomatic persons infected with Zika virus can transmit infection to sexual partners. The disease is associated with viremia, so not surprisingly, transfusion-related transmission has been reported.\n\n【56】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【57】The virus is detectable in breast milk,\n\n【58】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【59】Evidence of perinatal transmission of Zika virus, French Polynesia, December 2013 and February 2014.\n\n【60】but breastfeeding-associated transmission has not been reported so far.\n\n【61】Pathogenesis\n------------\n\n【62】Zika virus is an RNA virus that is closely related to other flaviviruses including yellow fever, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile virus. Little is known about its pathogenesis; however, it is thought that viral replication occurs in local dendritic cells after inoculation from a mosquito with subsequent spread to lymph nodes and the bloodstream.

When they occur, the symptoms of Zika infection are typically mild. Most commonly seen are fever, itchy maculopapular rash , nonpurulent conjunctivitis, and arthralgia involving the small joints of the hands and feet. Myalgias and headache, including retro-orbital pain, can also be present. Symptoms generally resolve in a few days. Unlike yellow fever and dengue infections, death, hemorrhagic complications, or severe illness requiring hospitalization are very rare. Zika virus infection does not have features that clearly distinguish it from mild cases of other arboviral diseases, although rash is more common with Zika virus.\n\n【82】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【83】Zika virus outbreak, Bahia, Brazil.\n\n【84】Guillain-Barré syndrome was first reported in association with Zika virus in the French Polynesian outbreak in 2013.\n\n【85】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【86】Zika virus infection complicated by Guillain-Barré syndrome—case report, French Polynesia, December 2013.\n\n【87】In July 2015, Brazil reported neurologic syndromes in patients with a recent history of Zika virus infection.\n\n【88】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【89】Of 42 patients with confirmed GBS, 26 (62%) had a history of symptoms consistent with Zika virus infection. In 2015, a total of 1708 cases of GBS were registered nationwide, representing a 19% average increase from the previous year. Colombia, El Salvador, Suriname, and Venezuela have also reported an observed increase of GBS.\n\n【90】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【91】Figure 3 Maculopapular rash in a patient infected with Zika virus.\n\n【92】From _Emerg Infect Dis_ ,\n\n【93】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【94】Probable non-vector-borne transmission of Zika virus, Colorado, USA.\n\n【95】with permission.\n\n【96】Most notably, Zika virus has been in the press because of an association with microcephaly in newborns (head circumference ≥2 SD below the mean for sex and gestational age at birth). Between 2010 and 2014, approximately 150 to 200 children per year were born with microcephaly. In October 2015, the Brazil Ministry of Health reported a 20-fold increase in cases of microcephaly—mostly in northeast Brazil, which also had a high prevalence of suspected cases of Zika virus infection. Although causation has not been established, several investigations have suggested a link between maternal infection and microcephaly in infants. Zika virus RNA has been identified by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction in the amniotic fluid of women whose fetuses had microcephaly and in tissues of infants with microcephaly.\n\n【97】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【98】Notes from the field: evidence of Zika virus infection in brain and placental tissues from two congenitally infected newborns and two fetal losses – Brazil, 2015.\n\n【99】It has also been found in tissue from fetal losses from 4 women who were infected during pregnancy.\n\n【100】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【101】Brazilian Medical Genetics Society–Zika Embryopathy Task Force  \nPossible association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly – Brazil, 2015.\n\n【102】In another study, all mothers of a Brazilian cohort of 35 infants born with microcephaly had lived in or visited an area affected with Zika virus during their pregnancy. Abnormalities in the infants consisted of widespread brain calcifications and ventricular enlargement secondary to cerebral atrophy. All tested negative for other infections including syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus infections. A recent report provided information on a European woman who had a clinical syndrome compatible with Zika virus infection at 13 weeks of gestation while living in Brazil.\n\n【103】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【104】Ultrasonography at 14 and 20 weeks of gestation detected no abnormalities but revealed microcephaly at 29 weeks of gestation. The mother underwent termination of the pregnancy. At fetal autopsy, microcephaly with multifocal calcifications in the cortex and subcortical white matter, severe hydrocephalus, and hypoplasia of the brain stem and spinal cord were noted. The entire Zika virus genome was recovered from fetal brain tissue. No other genetic abnormalities or other pathogens were found. These reports strongly support a link between maternal Zika infection and microcephaly. A case-control study is under way in Brazil to examine this association further and to determine whether other infections or environmental factors may be playing a role in the increased incidence of microcephaly.\n\n【105】A group of researchers have shown that, in vitro, the Zika virus is capable of infecting human neural progenitor cells. Infection resulted in disruption of cell cycle, increased cell death and attenuated neuron growth. Although this work is preliminary, the creation of this experimental model may pave the way for additional studies to determine the pathogenesis of microcephaly and other neurologic and ocular defects associated with Zika.\n\n【106】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【107】Further studies are also needed to determine the prognosis for infants with congenital Zika virus infection. For infants with microcephaly from other causes, a spectrum of neurologic deficits ranging from mild to severe are seen and are usually lifelong.\n\n【108】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【109】Zika virus infection is generally diagnosed clinically with subsequent confirmatory testing. Testing for Zika virus should be performed in patients who experience symptoms while traveling in an area where Zika virus transmission has been reported or within 2 weeks of return. Because dengue and chikungunya virus infections have similar symptoms and geographic distribution, patients with suspected Zika virus infection should also be evaluated for these infections. Zika virus testing is currently performed only at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Arbovirus Diagnostic Laboratory and at some state public health departments. It is not commercially available. Clinicians should contact their state or local health department to facilitate testing.\n\n【110】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【111】Available tests include (1) reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction on serum if within a week of symptom onset and (2) testing for Zika virus–specific IgM antibodies in serum for infection after 1 week of symptom onset. Cross-reaction with other flaviviruses (eg, dengue virus and yellow fever) is common, and test results should be interpreted with the assistance of an infectious disease specialist and the performing laboratory. The CDC has specific instructions for sending diagnostic specimens and completing the specimen submission form.\n\n【112】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【113】Zika Virus and Pregnancy\n------------------------\n\n【114】Women who are pregnant should avoid travel to areas where Zika virus transmission is ongoing. Updated information regarding areas with active transmission can be found on the CDC website.\n\n【115】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【116】If a pregnant woman cannot postpone travel, she should be advised to follow mosquito avoidance precautions. All pregnant women should be asked about travel history. Women who experience symptoms while traveling in an area where Zika transmission has been reported or within 2 weeks of return should be tested for Zika virus infection as soon as possible. Asymptomatic women who report travel to such areas while pregnant should be offered serologic testing for Zika virus between 2 and 12 weeks after return and should also undergo fetal ultrasonography . Guidance in this area is evolving rapidly as more data become available, and readers should refer to the CDC website for the latest recommendations. The CDC recently recommended that pregnant women should avoid unprotected sex with a partner who has a history of travel to a Zika infection risk area for the duration of the pregnancy.\n\n【117】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【118】Interim guidelines for prevention of sexual transmission of Zika virus – United States, 2016.\n\n【119】Figure 4 Testing algorithm for pregnant woman with history of travel to an area with ongoing. Zika virus transmission.\n\n【120】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【121】From _MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep_ .\n\n【122】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【123】Update: interim guidelines for health care providers caring for pregnant women and women of reproductive age with possible Zika virus exposure–United States, 2016.\n\n【124】Infants should be tested for Zika virus if they are born to women who traveled to an area with ongoing Zika virus transmission and have microcephaly or intracranial calcifications or if the mother has positive or inconclusive Zika virus test results.\n\n【125】<sup><a>30</a></sup>\n\n【126】Women of childbearing age who are planning travel to Zika-endemic areas should be counseled on ways to prevent unintended pregnancy. Although a causal link between Zika virus and microcephaly has not been established, public health agencies in several countries where Zika virus outbreaks are occurring have taken the unprecedented step of recommending that women living in these countries delay pregnancy for the next several months to years.\n\n【127】<sup><a>31</a></sup>\n\n【128】Treatment\n---------\n\n【129】There is no specific antiviral treatment available for Zika virus. Treatment is focused on symptomatic relief including rest and hydration. Fever may be treated with acetaminophen. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be used after dengue virus has been ruled out to reduce the risk for hemorrhage but should be avoided in pregnant women. Antihistamines may be helpful to control itching in patients with a rash. Patients with suspected Zika virus infection should be protected from further mosquito exposure during the first few days of illness to prevent other mosquitoes from becoming infected and thus reduce the risk of local transmission.\n\n【130】Prevention\n----------\n\n【131】There is no vaccine available to prevent Zika virus infection. The mainstay of prevention is minimizing exposure by controlling mosquito populations and avoiding bites. Mosquito control efforts have been hampered recently by a report from Argentina\n\n【132】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【133】blaming pyriproxyfen (a pesticide used to kill mosquito larvae in standing water) rather than Zika for the increase in fetal loss and microcephaly in Brazil. Investigators from the WHO, US Environmental Protection Agency, and European Union have found no evidence that the larvicide affects the course of pregnancy or the development of a fetus. The product has been used in Brazil since the late 1990s without being linked to microcephaly.\n\n【134】For personal protection against mosquito bites, residents of or travelers to Zika transmission areas should be counseled to:\n\n【135】*   •\n\n【136】    Wear long-sleeved shirts, pants, and hats\n\n【137】*   •\n\n【138】    Apply insect repellent to exposed skin, especially during the day when _Aedes_ mosquitoes are most active. The most effective insect repellent in the United States is diethyltoluamide at the recommended concentration of 20% to 50%. Other options include icaridin (concentration of at least 20%) and lemon eucalyptus extract (concentration of at least 30%). Diethyltoluamide- and icaridin-containing insect repellants are safe for use in pregnancy when used as directed on the product label.\n\n【139】*   •\n\n【140】    Treat clothing with permethrin\n\n【141】*   •\n\n【142】    Sleep under mosquito nets or in air-conditioned rooms with windows closed\n\n【143】The Table provides additional practical advice for persons considering travel to areas where Zika virus transmission has occurred.\n\n【144】Table Advice for Individuals Considering Travel to an Area Where Zika Virus Infection Is Circulating\n\n| Before travel |\n| --- |\n| Recommend personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites |\n| Consider referral to a travel medicine professional |\n| Counsel on ways to avoid unintended pregnancy during travel |\n| Recommend against travel if pregnant |\n| After travel |\n| Remind travelers to report symptoms compatible with Zika virus infection that occur within 3 weeks of return |\n| Recommend that travelers avoid donating blood for 28 days after return |\n| Recommend that men avoid unprotected sex with a pregnant partner for the duration of pregnancy |\n| Recommend that pregnant women report travel that has occurred during pregnancy to their antenatal care professional so that appropriate monitoring can occur |\n\n【146】Zika Virus Infection and Public Health Implications\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【147】Genetic studies indicate that the virus spreading through the Americas is closely related to the Asian strains of Zika virus that caused the outbreaks in Polynesia. The virus was possibly imported to Brazil by travelers attending the FIFA World Cup or alternatively by participants at the August 2014 International Va'a World Sprints canoe championship in which many Pacific island nations participated.\n\n【148】<sup><a>33</a></sup>\n\n【149】Zika virus transmission from French Polynesia to Brazil.\n\n【150】This news comes just as Brazil is preparing to host another enormous sporting event—the Olympic Games in August 2016. An estimated 500,000 visitors including 200,000 from the United States are expected to travel to Brazil to attend the games.\n\n【151】<sup><a>34</a></sup>\n\n【152】Researchers weigh risks of Zika spreading at Rio Olympics.\n\n【153】If the Zika virus outbreak is not contained by then, some of these visitors could become infected and carry Zika virus infection back to their home country and, given the right mosquito vector, set off additional outbreaks.\n\n【154】The _Aedes_ mosquito is well established across the Americas except for Canada and Chile and therefore all these areas are potentially at risk. Experts have stated that because of extensive mosquito control activities in the United States, the risk of Zika virus spread is low. Chikungunya and dengue viruses, other _Aedes_ \\-borne infections, have not spread in the continental United States despite major outbreaks in the Caribbean. In contrast, West Nile virus, another mosquito-borne illness spread by the _Culex_ mosquito, first appeared in the United States in 1999\n\n【155】<sup><a>35</a></sup>\n\n【156】West Nile virus: epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prevention.\n\n【157】and by 2014 was well established in all 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia.\n\n【158】<sup><a>36</a></sup>\n\n【159】West Nile virus and other nationally notifiable arboviral diseases – United States, 2014.\n\n【160】Climactic conditions may have played a role in the recent explosive spread of Zika virus in South America. Southern Brazil and Uruguay had an unusually wet winter followed by a warm summer.\n\n【161】<sup><a>37</a></sup>\n\n【162】 10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00256-7 .\n\n【163】Standing water on the ground in winter serves as mosquito breeding grounds and may have spurred growth of mosquito populations. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are most active in warm weather. Individuals tend to spend more time outdoors in warmer weather, which facilitates transmission of Zika virus. Drought conditions are associated with storage of water in containers around households, which can further promote mosquito breeding.\n\n【164】Zika virus disease is relatively mild. The biggest threat to public health from Zika virus comes from the association with neurologic syndromes including microcephaly and GBS. Managing these conditions is resource intensive and can place considerable strain on the medical system. Like Ebola virus, the disease has exposed vulnerabilities in the ability of resource-limited countries to handle infectious disease emergencies. Finally, Zika virus infection has raised ethical/moral/legal questions in Latin American countries, where health officials have suggested that women postpone pregnancies but women have limited access to birth control.\n\n【165】<sup><a>38</a></sup>\n\n【166】A scoping review on determinants of unmet need for family planning among women of reproductive age in low and middle income countries.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

These issues influence much of the nature, direction, and funding of stem cell investigations, particularly those involving adult stem cells. The unmentionable issues are like the proverbial “elephants in the room”: large, impossible to ignore, and coyly disregarded by those with a habit or inclination to repress anxiety-inducing facts. As in psychotherapy or at family gatherings, ignoring the elephant is often the most comfortable option, but in the long run it is also counterproductive. In naming these metaphorical elephants directly, despite the anxiety often raised in doing so, they may be tamed, reduced, or even coaxed from the room.\n\n【1】The elephants discussed in this commentary are not the only stem cell–related elephants by any means, but they are the ones that I hear most clearly trumpeting their presence at scientific gatherings. Thus, this commentary is exceedingly personal—different investigators might take note of very different looming beasts. The topics that I have chosen to name include issues of scientific methods and sociopolitical situations that impact the science. I also focus on the “jungle” I know best, that of adult stem cells. There are other, often neighboring, jungles with their own distinct elephants.\n\n【2】I encourage all people interested in advancements within this exciting area—scientists, clinicians, ethicists, politicians, journalists, businessmen, and of course those who hope to benefit from stem cell therapeutics—to become familiar with these elephants. Familiarity makes it less likely that a person will inadvertently be stepped on. Moreover, being aware of some elephants may encourage people to remain on the lookout for others; elephants usually travel in large herds.\n\n【3】Elephant No. 1: The Fall and Rise of Tissue Biology\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】The success of the biological sciences during the past centuries has largely arisen from the tendency to break the organism down into component parts. It has been a relatively steady march of progress: gross anatomy leading to histology, in turn leading to cell biology, and then to molecular biology. The success of this approach is obvious, but limitations are emerging at the frontier that stem cell research represents.\n\n【5】With the emergence and dominance of molecular biology, the nature of data and the manner in which data are acquired have changed. The introduction of gel electrophoresis, as well as measuring and demonstrating molecular processes within cells, became the hallmark of scientific data production and presentation. Microscopic images, when presented as data, usually show isolated cells in the culture dish. Even then, it is the molecular aspects of the presented work that predominate. When histological images, ie, pictures of tissue, appear in journals devoted to basic biological sciences, they are most often treated as opportunities for aesthetically pleasing covers, rather than the core scientific data of the report. The content of the journal articles typically addresses chemistry or biology within the gel or the cell, not in the tissue.\n\n【6】However, it is impossible to understand in vivo stem cell plasticity  without considering tissue biology. The data of greatest import in this work have proved to be the histological images, not the isolated cells or molecules. Cell and molecular biology obviously play important roles, particularly in determining the mechanisms whereby cells of one tissue become those of another, but the final determination of experimental results is best and perhaps only demonstrated by creative staining and photography of the presences of cells _in tissues._\n\n【7】Table 1 Definitions of Some Technical Stem Cell Research Terms\n\n| Cell plasticity | The potential of a somatic stem cell derived from one tissue to differentiate into mature cells of another tissue (ie, transdifferentiation capacity) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Clonal expansion | A population of cells descended from repeated cell divisions of one single original cell |\n| Fusion | The process of hybrid cell formation. In the context of stem cell research, such a process has been shown to occur in vitro between |\n\n【9】Moreover, the tissue-specific functionality of cells that are completely incorporated into normal tissue architecture is often overlooked by cell and molecular biologists. In contrast, classic physiologists and pharmacologists often demand demonstration of function, even when tissue structure is provided as data. After decades of focus on cell culture methods, in which demonstration of function must exist outside of tissue structure, these cell and molecular scientists have forgotten (if they ever knew) that maintenance of tissue architecture says more about functional status of a cell than any small set of functional markers they might suggest. After all, incorporation into and maintenance of tissue architecture _are_ demonstrations of tissuespecific function.\n\n【10】Thus, stem cell research necessitates a reassembly of the component parts, with a reemergence of tissue biology as “basic science” and of the histological image as the most important unit of data. Although many stem cell investigators are thoroughly trained in the ways of cell and molecular biology, few have any but the most rudimentary training in normal microanatomy, let alone how that anatomy changes in the disease and injury models they use. Veterinary and medical anatomical pathologists have this training. It behooves stem cell investigators to collaborate with these scientists and clinicians. Moreover, journals to which such work has been submitted should have such experts available to properly assess it. Without the involvement of these specialists, the field is impoverished and its investigations questionable.\n\n【11】Elephant No. 2: Cell Isolation _Is_ Cell Conditioning\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】In this era of dogma busting, there is one dogma that no one suggests needs revision. In the elegant formulation of Lewontin,\n\n【13】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【14】It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and Other Illusions. Review of Books , New York, NY 2000\n\n【15】“the internal and external co-determine the cell.” This means that there is no cell function or differentiation state that is independent of its microenvironment, yet cell and molecular biologists routinely speak of cell isolation procedures as separate from conditioning (ie, the process by which cells are manipulated in culture after their isolation). These isolation procedures, however, are always conditioning steps—the distinction between isolation and conditioning is false and arbitrary.\n\n【16】We routinely take cells from their normal environments and pass them through isolation procedures, the impact of which is rarely understood, let alone investigated. Setting aside the extraordinary violence of isolating cells from intact tissues via mechanical and enzymatic tissue disaggregation, consider a relatively nonviolent isolation procedure, that of CD34 <sup>+ </sup> circulating hematopoietic cells from the peripheral circulation. Venipuncture and exposing cells to turbulence and contact with low-temperature metal and plastic surfaces is followed by antibody binding for flow cytometric sorting. Each of these may have enormous impact on cell functioning. Although there are some data on the effects of turbulence,\n\n【17】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【18】Optimized suspension culture: the rotating-wall vessel.\n\n【19】cold,\n\n【20】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【21】Cross-talk between cellular stress, cell cycle and anticancer agents: mechanistic aspects.\n\n【22】and exposure to nonbiologic surfaces,\n\n【23】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【24】Relationships among cell attachment, spreading, cytoskeletal organization, and migration rate for anchorage-dependent cells on model surfaces.\n\n【25】understanding of the function of CD34 is minimal\n\n【26】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【27】Up-regulation of surface CD34 is associated with protein kinase C-mediated hyperphosphorylation of CD34.\n\n【28】 therefore, we have no understanding of whether binding of anti-CD34 antibody to the cell is stimulatory, inhibitory, or neutral. Thus, even before formal experimentation has begun, the conditioning of the cell is under way, but we have little understanding of the nature of that conditioning.\n\n【29】At the logical extreme, this problem leads to an “uncertainty principle” to be applied to cell behavior: that any attempt to observe a cell necessarily disrupts the microenvironment and therefore the nature of the cell.\n\n【30】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【31】Stem cells: attributes, cycles, spirals, pitfalls and uncertainties: lessons for and from the crypt.\n\n【32】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【33】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【34】Toward a new paradigm of cell plasticity.\n\n【35】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【36】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【37】New principles of cell plasticity.\n\n【38】Whether such “uncertainty” is a result of our technological limitations or is directly analogous to Heisenberg's principle in quantum physics remains unclear, although the latter may be argued. At the minimum, however, the assumption that the isolated ex vivo cell is representative of the in vivo cell in its normal environment is at best presumptuous. We underestimate the importance of this issue to our peril, yet we do so routinely and casually. One initial response is to simply become cognizant of the language we use; we must avoid statements that suggest too strongly that the behavior of isolated cells in an experimental setting reflects back on the behavior of cells and environments from which they derive. The cells in our hands and in our laboratories are not the same as they were in the body.\n\n【39】Elephant No. 3: Basic vs Applied Science\n----------------------------------------\n\n【40】Stem cell studies, typically discussed and revered as hypothesis-driven “basic science,” are at this stage often fundamentally about application rather than elucidation of biological mechanisms. One can see this in requests for applications for private or public funding of such research, let alone the responses to these applications. Hypotheses are nice, in fact necessary, but the attention-getting importance of the work is often not about a pure understanding of our physical nature but about direct development of therapeutic interventions.\n\n【41】There is a constant tension between “basic” and “applied” science in presentations at stem cell biology meetings. Panel discussions and meeting rosters are often a mix of hypothesis-driven research and attempts to jump-start clinical interventions, and, as responses to hybrid pursuits, the arguments that surround the work are often confused, arising from unstated differences in goals. One group of researchers might be caught up with details of which cells in the bone marrow can become cells of lung or liver tissue; another group grumbles about the “pointlessness” of the issue because whole bone marrow can probably “work just as well” as a particular subtype of progenitor. Enthusiasm for detail and impatience can flip back and forth across an audience as presentations proceed.\n\n【42】A current example of this can be found in the adult stem cell controversy about cell fusion  and what it means to stem cell plasticity studies. The importance of the finding and its ability to generate discomfort depend completely on one's point of view. To those who are simply interested in elucidating biological mechanisms of cell plasticity, purely for their own sake, there is no controversy, there is simply another mechanism of genomic plasticity  to explore. To those who are therapeutically minded, the response depends on their cell of choice. If one is looking to induce maturation of hepatocytes from fetal liver cells or from embryonic stem cells, then fusion is a polemical thrust at the potential of adult marrow-derived cells. In contrast, if one is committed to developing interventions based on adult, perhaps marrow-derived, stem/progenitor cells, then this fusion research simply suggests another physiological process that can be manipulated for the desired purposes. The passions stirred by discussions of these findings clearly are not simply about the “facts” but about the investigational and practical goals of the individual investigator.\n\n【43】The situation is potentially further complicated by entrepreneurial pressures. At least in the United States, therapies and other practical benefits from cell manipulations are patentable and therefore potentially profitable. However, creating a patent based on such discoveries requires that the information not be disclosed in the public domain. The obvious impact is that scientists who have practical goals for their investigations, even if they are not “businesssavvy,” are likely to be sought out by those who are business-savvy (from university offices of industrial liaison to private entrepreneurs to established industrial entities) within a short time. Subsequently, they often find themselves pressured to plan announcements of findings around business requirements or even to withhold data, undermining the free flow of ideas.\n\n【44】Of course, these tensions are not limited to the world of stem cells, but there are few areas more thoroughly infiltrated by them. Changes in investigational work have been developing for several decades, driven in part by altruism but also by investment possibilities: first for the development of new drugs and subsequently for biological “products” of diverse types, whether for industrial purposes or for therapeutics. With rising pressures to benefit from or to cooperate with industrial/business interests, if only to secure readily available sources of funding when public funds might be scarce, the goals of the biologist change, sometimes subtly, sometimes to a great degree.\n\n【45】Thus, with or without the intrusion of entrepreneurial ambitions, basic scientists now often find themselves doing what might conventionally be characterized as applied science, and conversely applied scientists (ie, clinicians and engineers) suddenly find themselves doing basic science. Each of us probably has some fundamental, core professional identity that we use to present ourselves to the world: cell or molecular biologist, pathologist, surgeon, internist, etc. However, in reality, nearly all stem cell investigators have evolved (or mutated) into some combination of scientist, engineer, and entrepreneur .\n\n【46】Elephant No. 4: _Nature_ , _The New York Times_ , and _The National Enquirer_\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】The influence of the media in the development of the stem cell field is as prominent as in any other segment of our culture. However, except for war, few other current topics have such a broad spectrum of coverage as stem cells, beginning with the scientific journals; moving through the general lay press, including television, radio, and print media; into specialized media, in particular those representing or catering to business concerns.\n\n【48】The reason for the widespread influence is obvious: stem cells have been hyped as the most recent best hope for a comprehensive cure-all for human disease, injury, and aging. Is there anyone without an interest in these possibilities? Many researchers in the field have already been through at least one round of press releases from their home institution or from the scientific journal publishing their work. These announcements are rarely ignored; rather, they are often followed by national and even international media attention. Eventually, these investigators will be on the list of “experts” interviewed for comments when other investigators’ work begins the same cycle of media exposure.\n\n【49】For the scientific journals that publish reports on stem cells, impact factors are maintained or increased with the announcement of new “high-profile” research. This is true for journals with high impact factors and for journals with lower impact factors. Indeed, stem cell research in general and adult stem cell research in particular probably afford the publishing journal the highest possible guaranteed exposure. The “impact value” was high for the earliest demonstrations of adult stem cell plasticity, which leapt to particular prominence when the political debates surrounding funding of embryonic stem cell research flowed over the quieter work being performed . It continues now with each “cure” within an animal model of a terrible human disease: myocardial infarction, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, etc.\n\n【50】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【51】Bone marrow cells regenerate infarcted myocardium.\n\n【52】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【53】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【54】In vivo derivation of glucose competent pancreatic endocrine cells from bone marrow without evidence of cell fusion.\n\n【55】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【56】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【57】Injection of adult neurospheres induces recovery in a chronic model of multiple sclerosis.\n\n【58】How does this impact the science? Journalism, including that reporting on the best of the scientific journals, increasingly relies on short, uncomplicated phrases— sound bites—to convey simple messages regarding any topic of high public interest. Thus, the complex data and early attempts at building integrative hypotheses, which are the hallmark of cutting edge research, often become oversimplified in the quest for rapid diffusion and for explanations “simple enough” for the general population.\n\n【59】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【60】Observations from the Mayo Clinic National Conference on Medicine and the Media.\n\n【61】Indeed, it is not uncommon for scientists to find that complex statements are often chopped into inaccurate sentence fragments that, with quote marks, are read by family, friends, neighbors, colleagues, politicians, and people with serious, sometimes potentially fatal illnesses. Responses to these fragments, whether fair encapsulations or gross distortions of complex findings, then distort the debate. Moreover, many of the journalists at wide-impact newspapers have their set panels of commentators and interpreters; thus, journalistic commentary is often repetitively shaped by limited, perhaps even nonrepresentative, “experts” giving rise to further distortions, leading to subtle bias that remains unnoticed by the target audiences.\n\n【62】These processes would remain of only mild interest, perhaps worthy of minor gossip, if they were not played out in numerous ways in the lives of the people who follow the media for news on stem cell research. For example, interest of businesses and entrepreneurs is often first piqued and influenced by media representations of the field, rather than by the work itself. _The Wall Street Journal_ , network evening news, and _Business Week_ are among the first conduits to enhance potential investors’ awareness of new developments and possible business opportunities. The general public, made up of diverse interests but clustered around disease entities, does not generally read the primary report, but responds to media representations, contacting the investigators, their own physicians, or their advocacy organizations. Increasingly, this creates a practical and political pressure that feeds back into funding and research priorities.\n\n【63】Then, of course, there is the personal experience of the researchers now exposed to media scrutiny or co-opted by the media for its own purposes. This path may lead to 15 (or 50 or 500) minutes of fame for the researcher. Even if a researcher eschews such temporary celebrity, it is not without import for deans of institutions and for their departmental chairs. The time diverted by these pursuits can interfere with the work itself. Research agendas can be shaped by the utility of and craving for such media attention.\n\n【64】On the negative side of this arrangement, the tendency of the media to trade in or cater to simplistic versions of the complex truth can distort the production of data, open discussion of hypotheses, and dissemination of new findings. On the positive side, there is tremendous opportunity to educate the general public about exciting new developments and about the role that state-of-the-art science can play in the realm of the personal and of the public.\n\n【65】Elephant No. 5: The Embryonic vs Adult Stem Cell Debate\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【66】This is the biggest elephant by far. It has conditioned research agendas, funding patterns, and publication or rejection of data, ie, every aspect of and the scientific discourse around new findings. Some of the influence has been positive; much has been negative.\n\n【67】The initial reports of adult stem cell plasticity—blood to muscle, brain to blood, blood to liver\n\n【68】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【69】Muscle regeneration by bone marrow-derived myogenic progenitors .\n\n【70】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【71】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【72】Turning brain into blood: a hematopoietic fate adopted by adult neural stem cells in vivo.\n\n【73】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【74】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【75】Bone marrow as a potential source of hepatic oval cells.\n\n【76】—were heralded by _Science_ as the “scientific breakthroughs of 1999.”\n\n【77】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【78】Breakthrough of the year: capturing the promise of youth.\n\n【79】Naturally, the reports were immediately controversial. Chipping at decades-old encrustations of dogma, the revolutionaries were having a field day, while the dogmatists and guardians of doctrine were soon beside themselves. All in all, this activity occurred during an exciting but essentially normal time in the world of science, emblematic of the passionate engagement that is the best of science and the best of scientists. It was not certain whether the aforementioned 3 reports, and the rapid follow-up studies, would survive the test of time; but it was clear that this was more than a single laboratory reporting “cold fusion.”\n\n【80】Alas, it was around this time that the controversy about the use of embryonic stem cells flared. The first influence of this simultaneity was felt in the “meaning” attached to adult stem cell research. Immediately, the single most important feature of the research was that it could be used for therapeutic purposes. All subsequent funding applications, nearly all the research, and all the scientific editorializing would swirl around the practical applications of the findings, not about the “pure” science of finding out how our bodies work. From this moment forward, research into adult stem cell plasticity would always be looked at, first and foremost, through the lens of therapeutic applicability, rather than simple curiosity about the body. Thus, one might consider that this elephant was perhaps the mother of Elephant No. 3.\n\n【81】Worse yet, the study of adult stem cells became inextricably tangled with that of embryonic stem cells. A similar political engagement in biomedical research flared in the mid-1990s with debates about use of fetal tissues; the political shift in America that followed the 1998-1999 change in American government created the chance for the antiabortion lobby of the United States to exert greater influence than before. At some point early on in the embryonic stem cell debate, the antiabortion lobby seized on a potent, very simple formula: if adult stem cells could do everything embryonic stem cells could do, then embryonic cell research is not necessary.\n\n【82】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【83】Scientists, senators testify on stem cell research.\n\n【84】Our own report that a single transplanted marrow stem cell could, through clonal expansion , generate tissues of mesodermal, endodermal, and ectodermal lineages was seized quickly by the antiabortion lobby as confirmation of this formula.\n\n【85】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【86】Multi-organ, multi-lineage engraftment by a single bone marrow-derived stem cell.\n\n【87】The appropriately honest and accurate response to the false statement that, if adult stem cells could do everything embryonic stem cells can do, then embryonic stem cell research is unnecessary would be that the issue is not a simple “either/or”\n\n【88】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【89】US and Canada: scientists press case for work on embryo cells: stem cell research controversy deepens as Bush considers ban on federal funding.\n\n【90】but instead is more complicated: maximizing the therapeutic potential of either cell population inevitably would require studying both cell populations. Information for making use of one cell population would inevitably be provided by studying the other, and furthermore it was entirely premature to predict which cell population would ultimately produce the most cost-effective therapeutic options.\n\n【91】However, the response of the proembryonic stem cell lobby, including scientists, journalists, and politicians, was swift, unequivocal, and unfortunate. Instead of attempting to convey a more complex message, they largely accepted these overly simplistic terms of the debate, responding in kind: embryonic stem cell research must go forward because adult stem cell research is not convincing. Thus, we have evolved to the current state in which support of embryonic stem cell research now requires that adult stem cell plasticity be repeatedly cast in a negative light.\n\n【92】Evidence for this can be found in a series of articles showing negative results published in high-quality journals.\n\n【93】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【94】Hematopoietic competence is a rare property of neural stem cells that may depend on genetic and epigenetic alterations.\n\n【95】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【96】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【97】Failure of bone marrow cells to transdifferentiate into neural cells in vivo.\n\n【98】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【99】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【100】Little evidence for developmental plasticity of adult hematopoietic stem cells.\n\n【101】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【102】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【103】Comment on “Failure of bone marrow cells to transdifferentiate into neural cells in vivo” \\[letter\\].\n\n【104】Although publication of negative results is crucial to the advancement of science, each of these prominent articles then had to face its own significant methodological criticisms of the sort that should have been addressed in the original process of review and acceptance.\n\n【105】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【106】Hematopoietic potential of neural stem cells \\[letter\\].\n\n【107】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【108】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【109】Hematopoietic potential of neural stem cells \\[letter\\].\n\n【110】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【111】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【112】Something in the eye of the beholder \\[letter\\].\n\n【113】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【114】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【115】Comments on “Little evidence for developmental plasticity of adult hematopoietic stem cells” \\[letter\\].\n\n【116】Particularly, they all shared an appearance of directly replicating prior research; however, in fact they made large and small changes in experimental design that made the experiments essentially incomparable to those in the earlier articles showing positive results. Indeed, one group of authors, when faced with those discrepancies of study design,\n\n【117】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【118】Comments on “Little evidence for developmental plasticity of adult hematopoietic stem cells” \\[letter\\].\n\n【119】essentially retreated from the originally overstated claims for the negative result.\n\n【120】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【121】Response to comment on “Little evidence for developmental plasticity of adult hematopoietic stem cells” \\[letter\\].\n\n【122】Thus, we have a decidedly uncomfortable situation. Few, if any, adult stem cell researchers object to embryonic stem cell research, yet they find their own work uncomfortably twisted by the antiabortion lobby to suggest that embryonic work is unnecessary. In contrast, after having accepted the false “either/or” terms of the debate thrust on them by antiabortion lobbyists, proponents of embryonic stem cell research find it necessary to undermine adult stem cell efforts. We are all in an unexpected and surprising bind in which political and social issues work not only to suppress lines of investigation but also to create internal conflicts for the scientists beyond more typical external conflicts. How this situation will resolve itself is unclear. The tensions, however, will certainly intensify.\n\n【123】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【124】Stem cell strides test Bush policy: scientists push for use of newer cell colonies.\n\n【125】Summary\n-------\n\n【126】The degree to which these elephants are disruptive to the steady advancement of the adult stem cell field will become clear with time. In some ways they enliven the discourse, but in many ways they interfere with efficient progress. Naming these elephants is a first step toward dealing with them. If we remain aware of these issues when evaluating new research, we are less likely to make careless mistakes, and we are more likely to be able to hold scientists, politicians, journalists, and entrepreneurs accountable for their practices. Although all adult stem cell researchers will spend time profitably riding some of these elephants, we will all inevitably spend more time cleaning up after them. Perhaps open, careful, and unbiased discussions of these elephants will help the cleanup work be less odious and completed sooner, rather than later.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Severity of epistaxis (determined using the Epistaxis Severity Score questionnaire); hemoglobin, iron, and ferritin levels; and quality of life data were collected serially in all patients.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Intravenous bevacizumab was administered to 34 patients using a standardized treatment protocol. Anemia was primarily related to severe epistaxis (n=15, 44%), severe gastrointestinal bleeding (n=4, 12%), or both (n=15, 44%), with a median baseline hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL (range, 8.3-10.5 gm/dL; to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.62). Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions had been administered to 28 patients (82%). Of these, 16 patients (47%) were RBC transfusion dependent and had received a median of 75 RBC transfusions (range, 4->500 RBC units) before bevacizumab initiation. The median length of follow-up was 17.6 months from the beginning of bevacizumab treatment (range, 3-42.5 months). There was a significant reduction in epistaxis severity scores ( _P_ <.001) and RBC transfusion requirements ( _P_ \\=.007) after completion of the initial bevacizumab treatment cycle. New-onset or worsened hypertension was noted in 4 patients, with 1 patient experiencing hypertensive urgency with a temporary decline in renal function.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Intravenous bevacizumab is an effective treatment option for patients with severe anemia related to epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding.

She denied experiencing any recent longdistance travel, trauma, estrogen use, fever, chest pain, dyspnea, hemoptysis, syncope, or previous deep venous thrombosis. She had a 2-month history of increasing dysuria, urinary frequency, nocturia, urge incontinence, and intermittent vaginal bleeding. In addition, she had excreted no urine for 24 hours. The patient denied having any flank pain, hematuria, or passage of gravel in her urine. She had taken no analgesics nor been exposed to any radiologic contrast media.\n\n【1】The patient's history was notable for several episodes of pyelonephritis during pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, vulval papillomas (one of which demonstrated in situ carcinoma on excision 40 years previously), and gastroesophageal reflux disease. She was a long-term smoker but consumed no alcohol. There was no family history of renal disease, thromboembolism, or cancer.\n\n【2】On examination, the patient appeared ill and pale. Her temperature was 37.2°C, pulse rate was 80/min, blood pressure was 100/60 mm Hg with no orthostatic drop, and respirations were 20/min. She had no adenopathy, goiter, or rash. Findings on a breast examination were normal. The apex beat was not displaced, the heart sounds were normal with a soft systolic murmur at the base, and there was no pericardial friction rub. Diffuse expiratory rhonchi were detected in the chest. Her abdomen was soft, nondistended, and without tenderness or bruits. The bladder was not palpable. Her right lower limb was swollen, warm, and tender up to the mid thigh with no cords palpable.\n\n【3】Initial laboratory results (reference ranges shown parenthetically) were as follows: hemoglobin, 5.9 g/dL (12.0–15.5 g/dL); mean corpuscular volume, 80 fL (81.6–98.3 fl.); leukocytes, 11.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (3.5–10.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L); platelet count, 224 × I09/L (150–450 × l09/L); activated partial thromboplastin time, 29 seconds (21–33 seconds); sodium, 130 mEq/L (135–145 mEq/L); potassium, 5.1 mEq/L (3.6–4.8 mEq/L); calcium, 8.9 mg/dL (8.9–10.1 mg/dL); phosphorus, 7.7 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL); urea, 193 mg/dl, (6–21 mg/dL); creatinine, 14.2 mg/dl, (0.6–0.9 mg/dl.); bicarbonate, 14 mEq/L (22–29 mEq/L); chloride, 100 mEq/L (100–108 mEq/L); anion gap, 16 (7–15); albumin, 3.4 g/dL (3.5–5.0 g/dL); total protein, 6.6 g/dL (6.3–7.9 g/dL); glucose, 152 mg/dL (70–100 mg/dL); and uric acid, 7.7 mg/dL (2.3–6.0mg/dL).\n\n【4】Insertion of a catheter yielded a small amount of urine that had an osmolality of 330 mOsm/kg and protein of 82 mg/24 h, with 4 to 10 erythrocytes per high-power field with no casts. The 24-hour urinary protein level was 1.5 g.

Often the treatment of sepsis itself can result in worsening renal function. Because our patient had no evidence of infection, sepsis is an unlikely cause of her renal failure.\n\n【18】One of the most worrisome complications of any vasculitic process is renal involvement due to immune complex deposition. Diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Wegener granulomatosis, polyarteritis nodosa, and Goodpasture syndrome can cause acute renal failure due to a crescentic glomerulopathy. This is often associated with extrarenal manifestations such as palpable purpura and nailfold hemorrhages. Our patient had no history or signs to suggest such a process. Of importance, urinalysis showed no erythrocyte casts, the hallmark of glomerulonephritis.\n\n【19】Chronic pyelonephritis is a possible cause of the renal failure because of her history of recurrent pyelonephritis, suggesting at least some reflux and thus the potential for scarring. The proteinuria and dilute urine are compatible with this diagnosis. However, this diagnosis would not explain the anuria.\n\n【20】Acute tubular necrosis is the result of episodes of prolonged hypotension with decreased renal perfusion (ischemic) or exposure to substances that are toxic to the renal tubules, such as aminoglycosides, contrast media, urate, oxalate, hemoglobin, and myoglobin. Our patient had no evidence of hypotension or exposure to nephrotoxic substances.\n\n【21】The most likely cause of our patient's renal failure is obstructive uropathy. Her history is suggestive of progressive outflow tract obstruction. Anuria is almost always due to obstruction, although rarely, acute cortical necrosis or necrotizing glomerulopathy can present in this manner.\n\n【22】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【23】Acu(eoliguria.\n\n【24】Oligoanuria alternating with polyuria suggests the presence of intermittent urinary tract obstruction.\n\n【25】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【26】Urinary tract obstruction.\n\n【27】At the time of admission, pelvic examination revealed a hard, irregular mass arising from the cervix and fixed to the anterior wall of the vagina.

Our patient had not been well and had limited activity for several days; thus, her risk for venous thrombosis was increased.\n\n【41】The nephrotic syndrome is associated with a thrombophilic state because of urinary losses of antithrombin III, altered levels and activity of proteins C and S, reactive hyperfibrinogenemia, impaired fibrinolysis, and increased platelet aggregation. The syndrome can slowly progress to end-stage renal failure. Renal venous thrombosis can result in acute deterioration of renal function in patients with this syndrome. This is usually associated with hematuria. However, the 24-hour urinary protein value was only 1.5 g in our patient. Thus, the nephrotic syndrome is excluded as the cause of the clot.\n\n【42】Malignancy results in a prothrombotic state by several mechanisms, including elevated levels of factor VIIa and fibrinogen and expression of tissue thromboplastin by numerous cancer cells. The latter is usually associated with mucin-secreting adenocarcinomas, but there are a few reports of undifferentiated squamous cell carcinoma producing this syndrome.\n\n【43】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【44】Spontaneous internai jugular vein thrombosis and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy: a rare simultaneous presentation of an occult malignant neoplasm.\n\n【45】In addition, malignant cells produce and express the so-called cancer procoagulant, recently identified as a cysteine protease, that can directly activate factor X.\n\n【46】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【47】Venous thromboembolism and cancer: a two-way clinical association.\n\n【48】Cervical carcinoma can spread to pelvic lymph nodes along the internal iliac vessels. Enlargement of these nodes or direct tumor extension can obstruct venous return and increase the risk of thrombosis.\n\n【49】Antiphospholipid antibodies cause a prothrombotic state. They may or may not be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, antiphospholipid antibodies are a possible cause of deep venous thrombosis in our patient.\n\n【50】During her first night in the hospital, our patient developed anterior chest pain extending to the interscapular region. This was associated with nausea, vomiting, dyspnea, and sweating. Her pulse rate was 90/min, respirations were 22/min, and oxygen saturation was 95% by pulse oximetry. The blood pressure in her right arm was 130/60 mm Hg and in her left arm was 96/60 mm Hg with a distinct delay between radial pulses. The jugular venous pressure was not elevated. Her heart sounds were unchanged with no diastolic murmur or pericardial friction rub. Expiratory rhonchi were detected in the chest, and the abdomen was unchanged. There was no tenderness on chest wall or abdominal palpation or spinal tenderness. All pulses in the lower limb were equal. There were no bruits in the axillae. A 12-lead electrocardiogram was unchanged, and findings on a portable chest radiogram were normal. Antacids provided no relief of her pain. Her activated partial thromboplastin time was 70 seconds.\n\n【51】*   3.\n\n【52】    **_Based on the physical findings and symptoms described, which one of the following is the most likely cause of the chest pain in this patient?_**\n\n【53】    *   a.\n\n【54】        _Gastroesophageal reflux_\n\n【55】    *   b.\n\n【56】        _Pericarditis_\n\n【57】    *   c.\n\n【58】        _Myocardial infarction_\n\n【59】    *   d.\n\n【60】        _Aortic dissection_\n\n【61】    *   e.\n\n【62】        _Pulmonary embolism_\n\n【63】The patient had documented gastroesophageal reflux. Usually, patients describe the pain as “burning,” and it may radiate to the lateral chest wall, jaws, and arms but not usually to the back. The pain is typically relieved rapidly with antacids. Because antacids resulted in no relief, reflux is an unlikely cause of her pain.\n\n【64】Pericarditis is common in renal failure. The pain is retrosternal and dull and may extend to the back. It is usually increased by swallowing, deep inspiration, or recumbency. Patients feel most comfortable stooping forward. The absence of a pericardial rub and the normal electrocardiogram make this diagnosis unlikely. The patient has risk factors for coronary artery disease, and the pain pattern is, compatible with a cardiac origin. However, the electrocardiogram during pain was normal, making the diagnosis of a myocardial infarction unlikely.\n\n【65】In any patient with chest or back pain in conjunction with asymmetrical pulses or blood pressure, aortic dissection must be specifically excluded. The pain is usually described as crushing or tearing and tends to migrate down the back as the dissection progresses. Physical signs can also include an early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation, pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, and neurologic signs. Patients at risk of coronary artery disease are also at risk for dissection. Based on physical findings, aortic dissection is the most likely cause of our patient's pain.\n\n【66】Although pulmonary embolism is always a consideration in a patient with deep venous thrombosis, this would not explain our patient's unequal pulses. In addition, her oxygen saturation had not changed since admission, and anticoagulation was adequate; thus, an initial diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is less likely.\n\n【67】Urgent transesophageal echocardiography showed no evidence of dissection. Serial electrocardiograms and cardiac enzymes ruled out myocardial infarction. Subsequently, a left subclavian artery stenosis found by ultrasonography explained the unequal blood pressure readings. Pulmonary angiography was not performed because of her renal failure, and a ventilation-perfusion scan was considered inappropriate in view of her smoking history. In light of the circumstances, the chest pain was most likely due to a pulmonary embolus, and an inferior vena caval filter was placed.\n\n【68】*   4.\n\n【69】    **_Which one of the following investigations is least likely to help in assessing this patient's obstructive uropathy?_**\n\n【70】    *   a.\n\n【71】        _Intravenous pyelography_\n\n【72】    *   b.\n\n【73】        _Cystoscopy_\n\n【74】    *   c.\n\n【75】        _Ultrasonography_\n\n【76】    *   d.\n\n【77】        _Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis_\n\n【78】    *   e.\n\n【79】        _Cancer antigen 125_\n\n【80】Intravenous pyelography can demonstrate cortical scarring, which could suggest chronic pyelonephritis, hydronephrosis, and filling defects that could be due to blood clots, tumor, or stones. However, it cannot define the nature of any mass causing extrinsic compression on the ureters or bladder.\n\n【81】Cystoscopy is a procedure with both diagnostic and therapeutic potential. It allows direct visualization of the lower urinary tract and retrograde cannulation of the ureters. Biopsy of mucosal abnormalities is possible, and stents can be placed to relieve obstruction.\n\n【82】Ultrasonography is noninvasive and can quickly confirm the presence of obstruction. It can also give a good estimate of renal cortical size and detect major scarring. Depending on user expertise, ultrasonography can demonstrate the cause of any obstruction. In addition, if hydronephrosis is found, percutaneous nephrostomy tubes can be placed to decompress the kidneys and salvage function. It may give false-negative results if the patient is dehydrated or if there has been insufficient time for dilatation to occur.\n\n【83】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【84】Acu(eoliguria.\n\n【85】Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis provides good visualization of the renal cortex, supplies evidence for analgesic nephropathy,\n\n【86】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【87】Analgesic nephropalhy.\n\n【88】and demonstrates stones. The soft tissue resolution allows tracing down the ureters to the point of obstruction and can usually define the cause of it. If a tumor is present, computed tomography provides valuable staging information.\n\n【89】An elevated cancer antigen 125 level is often found with ovarian tumors. However, it is not sufficiently specific to aid in diagnosis.\n\n【90】Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed a soft tissue mass in the region of the cervix, invading the urinary bladder at the trigone and possibly also the ureteral orifices. There was also pronounced dilatation of the pelvicaliceal system and ureters bilaterally, with some scarring in the right renal cortex. No pelvic lymph nodes were seen. Further images of the thorax showed multiple uncalcified pulmonary nodules compatible with metastatic disease.\n\n【91】A biopsy of the cervical mass showed invasive squamous cell carcinoma. The patient had advanced metastatic cervical carcinoma, with a poor prognosis.\n\n【92】*   5.\n\n【93】    **_Which one of the following is most appropriate in the further management of the patient's renal failure?_**\n\n【94】    *   a.\n\n【95】        _Percutaneous nephrostomy_\n\n【96】    *   b.\n\n【97】        _Pelvic irradiation_\n\n【98】    *   c.\n\n【99】        _Ureteral diversion_\n\n【100】    *   d.\n\n【101】        _No intervention, provide supportive care only_\n\n【102】    *   e.\n\n【103】        _Cystoscopy with ureteral stent placement_\n\n【104】Percutaneous nephrostomy is a reliable way of decompressing the upper urinary tract and can be done under local anesthesia with ultrasound guidance. It provides useful renal salvage. However, long term this is inconvenient, and infection can be a problem.\n\n【105】Pelvic irradiation can shrink the tumor and possibly relieve the obstruction, but it can take days. Radiation also helps to control the bleeding. Ureteral diversion requires major surgery in which the ureters are dissected from the retroperitoneum and implanted into an isolated segment of ileum, draining, via a cutaneous stoma. It is not indicated in a patient with metastatic cancer and a limited life expectancy.\n\n【106】Some experts may advocate that, in the face of metastatic carcinoma, only supportive care should be provided, and uremia should be allowed to take over slowly. This approach may be reasonable, but it is a major decision and the patient must be intimately involved after a clear discussion of all the options with the expected outcomes.\n\n【107】Cystoscopy with retrograde ureteral stent placement is the ideal procedure. It is minor surgery and allows internal decompression of the upper renal tract. After discussion with the patient, cystoscopy was performed. The posterior wall of the bladder was found to be completely infiltrated by tumor, and the ureteral orifices could not be seen; thus, retrograde ureteral stents could not be inserted. As a second best option, a percutaneous nephrostomy tube was inserted into the left kidney, and the creatinine level decreased to 1.7 mg/dL. Radiation, 30 Gy, was given to the pelvis with good control of the bleeding. Since then, the patient's hemoglobin concentration has normalized with no transfusion. She was dismissed with the nephrostomy tube in place and was to be followed up as an outpatient.\n\n【108】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【109】Despite the introduction of effective screening techniques, invasive cervical cancer is still common, with an estimated 13,700 new cases leading to 4900 deaths in 1998.\n\n【110】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【111】Cancer statistics, 1998 \\[published corrections appear in _CA Cancer J Clin._ 1998;48:l92and 1998;48:329J.\n\n【112】Risk factors include intercourse at a young age, multiple sexual partners, multiparity; low socioeconomic status, and cigarette smoking.\n\n【113】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【114】Tumors of the cervix.\n\n【115】The human papillomavirus is intimately involved in pathogenesis, with types 16, 18, 31, and 33 being found often in preinvasive and invasive cervical lesions. Expression of _ras_ and _c-myc_ oncogenes increases the risk of nodal and metastatic spread.\n\n【116】Initially, the tumor invades locally into the upper vagina and cardinal and ureterosacral ligaments. Extension into the parametrium can result in obstruction of 1 or both ureters. Anterior spread invades the bladder with a risk of vesicovaginal fistula formation (especially after surgery or irradiation). Posterior extension results in rectal invasion. Hydronephrosis and uremia are common end-stage features. Intraperitoneal spread can also occur. Lymphatic spread initially involves the pelvic lymph nodes with later extension into the para-aortic group. With advanced disease, supraclavicular adenopathy can be found. Pelvic lymph node obstruction can result in lymphedema and metastatic spread to the groin and the external genitalia.\n\n【117】Most women with cervical cancer present with vaginal bleeding, including menorrhagia or intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding, or vaginal discharge. Pelvic pain, urinary frequency, and hematuria are unusual, and it is rare for a patient to present with uremia, leg swelling, or evidence of disseminated disease.\n\n【118】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【119】Gynecologic cancer.\n\n【120】Computed tomography may be used to define spread of disease, although it may not detect lymph nodes smaller than 2 cm in diameter.\n\n【121】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【122】Abdominopclvic computed tomography in the preoperative evaluation of early cervical cancer.\n\n【123】Clinical staging is best done with the patient under anesthesia, usually at the time of cystoscopy or sigmoidoscopy.\n\n【124】Management depends on the stage. Our patient has stage IV disease. For stage IB to IIA (local disease without parametrial invasion), radical hysterectomy can result in a 5-year survival rate of 90% the local lesion is more than 4 cm in diameter, there is microscopic infiltration of the parametrium, or there is lymph node involvement, adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be given. Stages IIB to IV (locally advanced to metastatic disease) are treated by a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Induction chemotherapy can result in tumor bulk reduction before radiation therapy or radical hysterectomy. Response rates to chemotherapy vary from 35% to 85%. For stage lIB and III, radiotherapy can result in a 5-year survival rate of 65% and 45%, respectively.

Chest computed tomography revealed a large thrombus straddling the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery (“saddle” embolus) , multiple bilateral emboli in the peripheral pulmonary arteries and right upper lobe, and several wedge-shaped parenchymal opacities with a broad pleural base, compatible with pulmonary infarctions ( Figure, H and I, arrows ) and classically described as _Hampton hump_ when seen on chest radiography.

Clinical characteristics, polymerase chain reaction results, and raw electrocardiographic data were collected. A convolutional neural network was trained using 26,153 ECGs (33.2% COVID positive), validated with 3826 ECGs (33.3% positive), and tested on 7870 ECGs not included in other sets (32.7% positive). Performance under different prevalence values was tested by adding control ECGs from a single high-volume site.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The area under the curve for detection of acute COVID-19 infection in the test group was 0.767 (95% CI, 0.756 to 0.778; sensitivity, 98%; specificity, 10%; positive predictive value, 37%; negative predictive value, 91%). To more accurately reflect a real-world population, 50,905 normal controls were added to adjust the COVID prevalence to approximately 5% (2657/58,555), resulting in an area under the curve of 0.780 (95% CI, 0.771 to 0.790) with a specificity of 12.1% and a negative predictive value of 99.2%.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in electrocardiographic changes that permit the artificial intelligence–enhanced ECG to be used as a rapid screening test with a high negative predictive value (99.2%).

Given the periodic shortages of reagents for current coronavirus genetic screening tests, delays in obtaining results, and associated costs, a low-cost, readily scalable solution for rapid point-of-care screening is critical for pandemic management.\n\n【57】To test the hypothesis that an electrocardiography-based test could exclude COVID-19, a global volunteer consortium was formed to gather electrocardiographic and clinical data from individuals with and without COVID-19 to build a neural network to detect infection and to make the network widely available.\n\n【58】Methods\n-------\n\n【59】### Site Coordination\n\n【60】A total of 28 sites from 14 countries on 4 continents were included in this study . Each site ensured compliance of participation in this study, including deidentification of ECGs according to local Institutional Review Board policies and specific national and institutional patient privacy guidelines. All sites were given case report forms to complete on all cases, with data collated in a central database (Research Electronic Data Capture \\[REDCap\\]; Vanderbilt University).\n\n【61】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【62】Research electronic data capture (REDCap)—a metadata-driven methodology and workflow process for providing translational research informatics support.\n\n【63】Figure 1 Geographic distribution of enrolling sites. Shown is the geographic distribution of sites contributing electrocardiograms.\n\n【64】### Electrocardiogram Acquisition and Aggregation\n\n【65】All ECGs were aggregated in their raw digital form from local ECG servers. On identification of cases and controls, unique identifiers were applied to each patient at the site, and the raw digital files were transferred to an independent, password-protected research server at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, in FDA-XML format.\n\n【66】### Control Population\n\n【67】Three control populations were used. The first population was composed of ECGs from COVID-positive patients that were acquired more than 2 days before COVID-positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The second consisted of patients with ECGs acquired before September 2019. This date was chosen to ensure that the likelihood of any patient’s having been infected with COVID-19 was negligible, given that the first infections recorded occurred in the timeframe of November to December 2019 in Wuhan, China. The first 2 were used for training. The third consisted of 50,905 ECGs from a single site obtained before 2019. These were used to enrich the testing data set by altering the prevalence of COVID-19 to mirror a more general screening setting where the test positivity rate would be expected to be in the 5% to 10% range. All patients (outpatients and inpatients) were included in all sets.\n\n【68】### Case Population\n\n【69】The case population consisted of patients with a positive PCR test result for COVID-19. All ECGs available both before and after diagnosis were included in the data transferred from all sites. The date of each ECG and PCR test was recorded in the case report forms, as were the age and sex of the patient. The ECGs acquired in the window of interest served as positive samples, with the window starting 2 days before the positive PCR test result and ending 14 days after it. The ECGs from COVID-positive patients recorded before the window of interest were used as controls (labeled negative samples), and ECGs collected after the window of interest were used for a secondary analysis. Additional data recorded included the World Health Organization (WHO) symptom severity at the time of initial COVID-19 symptoms, at the date of index ECG (closest to first positive PCR test result), at 30 days after index ECG (which also recorded mortality status), and at the point of most severe symptoms during the interval between the index ECG and 30 days after the index ECG .

The ECGs with less than 10 seconds worth of data were excluded, as were those with incorrect format or arrival after the analysis completion date.\n\n【76】#### Model Development\n\n【77】Standard convolutional neural network\n\n【78】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【79】An artificial intelligence–enabled ECG algorithm for the identification of patients with atrial fibrillation during sinus rhythm: a retrospective analysis of outcome prediction.\n\n【80】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【81】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【82】Age and sex estimation using artificial intelligence from standard 12-lead ECGs.\n\n【83】and residual neural network\n\n【84】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【85】An artificial intelligence–enabled ECG algorithm for the identification of patients with atrial fibrillation during sinus rhythm: a retrospective analysis of outcome prediction.\n\n【86】architectures were evaluated with multiple initial learning rates (1e-3, 3e-4) and batch sizes (16, 32, and 64). The learning rate was configured to decrease by a factor of 1/3 if the model accuracy did not improve over 3 consecutive epochs. The model with the best area under the curve (AUC) in the internal validation set was selected as the optimal model and tested on the holdout cohort, composed of patients not used in model training or validation.

When the 12-lead and 6-lead inputs are used, 4 of the leads are augmented leads that do not contain additional information. However, to conform to standard electrocardiography devices, we used all 12 leads during the development of the networks. In addition, we created architectures with 8 leads (that use only the independent data found in a 12-lead ECG) and 2 leads (to match the independent data found in 6-lead systems) and found similar results.\n\n【91】### Statistical Analyses\n\n【92】The ECGs were partitioned into 3 mutually exclusive sets at the patient level. Model training was conducted on the training set and hyperparameter optimization on the validation set. All performance measures presented are based on the test data, which were not used for training or optimization. The network reports a score between 0 and 1 (0, low likelihood of infection; 1, high likelihood) for each ECG that is evaluated. The AUC was the primary outcome measure and was determined for the test cohort and then with additional controls to assess the impact of prevalence on test performance. The latter represents the scenario in which widespread testing at a lower disease prevalence is conducted, such as screening patients ahead of a medical evaluation or screening asymptomatic passengers as part of the boarding process.\n\n【93】Standard measures of diagnostic performance and their associated confidence intervals were computed according to the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy criteria.\n\n【94】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【95】The REDCap consortium: building an international community of software platform partners.\n\n【96】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【97】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【98】STARD 2015: an updated list of essential items for reporting diagnostic accuracy studies.\n\n【99】To form decisions based on model output, an optimal threshold was selected to provide 99% sensitivity in the _validation_ data. This threshold was used for both the test data alone (∼33% COVID-19 prevalence) and the test data enriched with additional control data (∼5% COVID-19 prevalence). With this threshold, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined.\n\n【100】To better understand model performance, exploratory analyses across a few key descriptive variables were undertaken. First, COVID-19 prevalence was strongly associated with heart rate. To address this, model performance stratified by heart rate groupings was evaluated. Second, it was hypothesized that increased viral load leads to downstream complications and would be associated with a more pronounced electrocardiographic signature. To explore this concept, we analyzed model prediction scores according to WHO symptom severity score and the change of scores over time in COVID-19 patients with multiple ECGs during follow-up. Finally, to test for an association of model performance and the days between the ECG acquisition and the COVID-19 diagnosis, a linear mixed model was used to examine the slope of the model output over the days surrounding diagnosis. This model included a main (fixed) effect for days from diagnosis and a random subject effect. Confidence intervals, when presented, for measures of diagnostic performance assume that multiple ECGs within a patient were statistically independent. Statistical analyses and model development were conducted using Python version 3.7.6 (Python Software Foundation) and R version 3.5.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\n\n【101】### Role of the Funding Source\n\n【102】The study was designed and conceived by Mayo Clinic investigators with no financial support from industry and made possible through the generous contribution of data, time, human resources, and intellectual capital from medical centers around the world (authors and _Discover Consortium_ ) invited to participate . In addition, General Electric, SHL Telemedicine, Philips, and Epiphany Healthcare donated resources, expertise, and, in some cases, equipment to aggregate electrocardiographic data into a central research server for analysis. The study was managed by an international volunteer steering committee . The protocol was approved by Institutional Review Boards at each participating site, with Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, serving as the coordinating site.\n\n【103】Results\n-------\n\n【104】### Characteristics of the Patients and Geographic Distribution\n\n【105】A total of 48,186 valid ECGs of 11,770 patients were included from 28 participating sites in 12 countries across 4 continents . There were 15,117 ECGs obtained from 4419 controls (mean 3.4±7.1 per patient). An additional 32,971 ECGs were obtained from 7340 COVID-19–positive patients (4.5±5.8), with 13,247 obtained close to the time of positive PCR test result (2 days before and up to 14 days after).

An additional 1028 ECGs had a maximum absolute amplitude of more than 5 mV and were excluded because of potential data quality issues . There were 791 ECGs from 196 COVID-positive patients excluded because of a missing PCR date, and 4710 ECGs from COVID-positive patients collected more than 14 days after the index PCR were excluded from the main analysis as prespecified. The final analyzed cohort consisted of 37,131 ECGs from 10,762 patients, with 13,247 ECGs labeled COVID positive. The distribution of WHO symptom severity scores at the time of index ECG from the 4392 patients in whom the score was recorded is shown in Supplemental Figure 1 .\n\n【121】### Network Performance: 12 Leads, 6 Leads, and 1 Lead\n\n【122】Based on the study population prevalence of 34.9%, the AUC was 0.767 (95% CI, 0.756 to 0.778) for the 12-lead AI-ECG in identifying acute COVID-19 infection. The model had a sensitivity of 98.0%, specificity of 10.2%, PPV of 36.7%, and NPV of 90.5% and _F_ <sub>1 </sub> score of 53.4%. The AUC for the 6-lead algorithm was 0.754 (95% CI, 0.742 to 0.765), with sensitivity of 97.9%, specificity of 7.8%, PPV of 36.1%, and NPV of 87.2% and _F_ <sub>1 </sub> score of 52.7%. Finally, the single-lead model resulted in an AUC of 0.745 (95% CI, 0.733 to 0.756) with a sensitivity of 98.5%, specificity of 6.5%, PPV of 35.9%, and NPV of 89.1% .\n\n【123】To better understand performance, the model was reevaluated by enriching the control population in the testing set with additional patients to vary the disease prevalence in the testing set. The AUC in the enriched cohort using prevalence of 5% was 0.780 (95% CI, 0.771 to 0.790), with 98.0% sensitivity and 12.1% specificity; the NPV is estimated to be 99.2%. With a COVID prevalence of 5% (the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention designation for red, or the point at which more aggressive social restrictions may be needed), for 1000 patients screened, 116 would be reassured of not being infected. Table 3 presents additional estimates of the test performance over a range of disease prevalences.\n\n【124】Table 3 Estimated Model Performance Measured by Positive and Negative Predicative Values Over a Range of COVID Prevalence Values\n\n| Disease prevalence | True cases (per 1000) | Negative cases (per 1000) | Positive predictive value (%) | Negative predictive value (%) | Expected positive test results | Expected negative test results |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1.0 | 10 | 990 | 1.1 | 99.8 | 880 | 120 |\n| 2.0 | 20 | 980 | 2.2 | 99.7 | 881 | 119 |\n| 5.0 | 50 | 950 | 5.5 | 99.1 | 884 | 116 |\n| 10.0 | 100 | 900 | 11.0 | 98.2 | 889 | 111 |\n| 15.0 | 150 | 850 | 16.4 | 97.2 | 894 | 106 |\n| 20.0 | 200 | 800 | 21.8 | 96.0 | 899 | 101 |\n| 25.0 | 250 | 750 | 27.1 | 94.8 | 904 | 96 |\n| 30.0 | 300 | 700 | 32.3 | 93.4 | 909 | 91 |\n| 35.0 | 350 | 650 | 37.5 | 91.8 | 914 | 86 |\n\n【126】### Serial Electrocardiographic Analysis in Patients With COVID-19\n\n【127】For COVID-19 patients who had ECGs available before the index diagnosis, the average network output of their pre–COVID-19 ECGs was similar to that of the control cohort, whereas the distribution of scores after diagnosis was markedly shifted toward larger values, as would be expected on the basis of the AUC for the model . Among 321 patients with serial ECGs between –2 and 14 days of diagnosis (2657 ECGs), there was gradual rise in the model output . During a longer time, a general decrease in the network output was observed up to more than 2 months after their index diagnosis . There was nonsignificant trend toward higher network scores in patients with higher index WHO symptom severity scores . Consistent with this finding, there was a trend toward higher network scores in inpatients vs outpatients .\n\n【128】Figure 3 A, Average network score among the general control population (control), prediagnosis electrocardiograms (ECGs) from patients with COVID-19 who had ECGs available from before their index COVID-19 diagnosis, and ECGs around the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. Presented are violin plots that indicate the relative proportion of patients composing the final mean and median for each group. B, Serial network scores over time . Shown is the average network score for individual groups of patients who had multiple ECGs during follow-up (before index COVID-19 diagnosis and up to more than 2 months after). Presented are violin plots with superimposed box plots. The violin plots provide a visual of the density (relative frequency of values) over the range of the values observed, with the larger width indicating an increased frequency. The box plot shows the lower quartile, median, and upper quartile of the distribution.\n\n【129】Figure 4 Shown is the change in mean network score among electrocardiograms available for patients according to their World Health Organization (WHO) severity score. Higher severity scores were associated with a statistically significant higher detection score.\n\n【130】### Impact of Specific Electrocardiographic Features on Network Prediction\n\n【131】Given the anecdotal observation that elevated heart rate at the time of diagnosis might predict infection, we sought to evaluate whether specific heart rate ranges among the broader ECG cohort had an impact on overall model accuracy. Specifically, the network was validated against ECGs within specific heart rate ranges (eg, 70 to 80, 80 to 90), and no significant relationship to model performance was observed .\n\n【132】Discussion\n----------\n\n【133】### Main Findings\n\n【134】We found that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop electrocardiographic changes identified by the AI-ECG. If validated prospectively, these may permit the AI-enhanced ECG to be used as a screening test to exclude acute infection. Specifically, assuming a population with 5% coronavirus infection, the NPV of the electrocardiographic screen was 99.2%, which might enable 12% of individuals to proceed without any additional screening. With additional prospective network training and coupling to data from a single PCR test, the number of passed tests may further increase. Through identifying those at low risk of active infection, it can further help in identifying those patients in whom a genetic or antigen-based COVID-19 test may be useful, independent of symptoms, and thus serve as an integral part of a cascaded testing regimen. This proof-of-concept, retrospective analysis demonstrates biologic plausibility, in support of prospective studies.\n\n【135】Importantly, we selected a point on the receiver operating characteristic curve with a high sensitivity and low specificity  to permit infection exclusion rather than inclusion. This has important practical implications in that the test output is best considered negative (no infection) or indeterminate (further testing needed). Thus, AI-ECG COVID screening applied in this manner must be part of tiered testing that includes PCR point-of-care testing. Whereas this first iteration of the AI-ECG COVID screen is a global test, applied in a similar manner to all individuals, in future iterations, the AI-ECG output could be coupled to the result of a home PCR test to identify a given individual’s COVID-negative AI-ECG signature. Such an approach, if validated, would further enhance the AI-ECG COVID screen performance.\n\n【136】Table 4 Diagnostic Performance at Candidate Thresholds\n\n| Threshold | Sensitivity (%) | Specificity (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| _0.44_ | _70.15_ | _70.44_ |\n| 0.05 | 99.51 | 4.65 |\n| 0.10 | 97.63 | 11.90 |\n| 0.15 | 94.99 | 20.57 |\n| 0.20 | 91.83 | 30.40 |\n| 0.25 | 88.52 | 40.36 |\n| 0.30 | 84.04 | 49.27 |\n| 0.35 | 79.34 | 58.00 |\n| 0.40 | 74.37 | 65.47 |\n| 0.45 | 68.80 | 71.62 |\n| 0.50 | 62.74 | 77.51 |\n| 0.55 | 56.00 | 82.90 |\n| 0.60 | 48.70 | 87.42 |\n| 0.65 | 40.12 | 91.13 |\n| 0.70 | 31.80 | 94.33 |\n| 0.75 | 23.64 | 96.39 |\n| 0.80 | 15.66 | 98.06 |\n| 0.85 | 8.73 | 99.24 |\n| 0.90 | 3.12 | 99.74 |\n| 0.95 | 0.45 | 100.00 |\n\n【138】This work used 12-lead ECGs, making these findings particularly useful in the clinic or hospital. However, we found that the AI-ECG worked with use of only 1 lead or 6 leads. Given that the AI-ECG may be acquired with smartphone-enabled electrodes to permit data acquisition in nearly any environment without disrobing, that no body fluids or reagents are needed for the test, and that it can be performed in less than 30 seconds, with proper validation such a test may allow health care systems, businesses, and societies at large to efficiently and effectively mitigate exposure risk through a readily scalable, noninvasive, real-time, low-cost test.\n\n【139】Such a noninvasive method to detect acute but potentially subclinical infection is of particular importance, given the prolonged incubation period (10 to 14 days) and the large proportion of patients who remain asymptomatic but potentially infectious.\n\n【140】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【141】Proportion of asymptomatic infection among COVID-19 positive persons and their transmission potential: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【142】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【143】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【144】The incubation period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from publicly reported confirmed cases: estimation and application.\n\n【145】While PCR testing continues to evolve, allowing at-home or saliva tests, most still require an unpleasant (and potentially difficult to self-administer) nasal swab or a prescription from a clinician and thus face challenges for broad, societal screening. Furthermore, the turnaround time on PCR testing for COVID-19 ranges from 15 minutes to more than 48 hours, depending on the assay and testing facility. An immediate, accurate, point-of-care “rule out” test would allow a portion of the population to continue to engage in society (whether attending classes at school, visiting restaurants, or going into work). The finding that the AI-ECG performs well with only 6 leads or a single lead suggests that currently available smartphone-enabled form factors may be used for screening. Such devices may be sanitized quickly and do not require removal of clothing or adhesive patches and are inexpensive enough to permit individual ownership. This approach could substantially improve on current entryway screening techniques, such as questionnaires and temperature assessment, which have a limited performance profile.\n\n【146】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【147】Prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of covid-19 infection: systematic review and critical appraisal .\n\n【148】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【149】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【150】Temperature screening has negligible value for control of COVID-19.\n\n【151】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【152】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【153】Clinical features of patients with COVID-19: is temperature screening useful?\n\n【154】### Impact of COVID-19 on the ECG\n\n【155】Coronaviruses may have a direct impact on both cardiac function and electrophysiology.\n\n【156】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【157】ECG changes after rabbit coronavirus infection.\n\n【158】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【159】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【160】Echocardiographic changes following rabbit coronavirus infection.\n\n【161】Investigators have demonstrated that rabbit coronavirus infection may result in several electrocardiographic changes, including ST-segment abnormalities, rhythm disturbances, and conduction defects that appear to be secondary to the myocardial disease induced.\n\n【162】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【163】ECG changes after rabbit coronavirus infection.\n\n【164】Specific to COVID-19, it has also previously been demonstrated that activation of ACE2 may have a direct impact on repolarization vis-à-vis the QT interval, with ACE2 activation also shortening the cardiac action potential in rat and other animal models.\n\n【165】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【166】Heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death in ACE2 transgenic mice with downregulated connexins.\n\n【167】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【168】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【169】Activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 improves cardiac electrical changes in ventricular repolarization in streptozotocin-induced hyperglycaemic rats.\n\n【170】COVID-19 infection has effects on the QT interval, independent of potential QT-prolonging agents.\n\n【171】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【172】Evaluation of electrocardiographic ventricular repolarization variables in patients with newly diagnosed COVID-19.\n\n【173】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【174】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【175】Electrocardiographic findings in coronavirus disease-19: insights on mortality and underlying myocardial processes.\n\n【176】Moreover, COVID-19 infection results in a plethora of ubiquitous systemic and cellular changes, including severe inflammation and RAS activation, known to affect cardiac repolarization. Thus, it stands to reason that acute COVID-19 infection may have a direct impact on the ECG, in subtle, multifactorial ways. Acute electrocardiographic changes may result from a combination of compensatory changes associated with infections in general (eg, sinus tachycardia), secondary effects on cardiac structure and hemodynamics due to respiratory compromise (eg, right ventricular enlargement or decrease in function), or direct interaction of COVID-19 with the ACE2 receptor (eg, evidence of myocardial injury, inflammation, or changes in ventricular repolarization). Thus, such electrocardiographic changes may help in risk stratifying for potential active COVID-19 infection.\n\n【177】### Impact of Disease Prevalence\n\n【178】An important consideration in this study is the impact of prevalence on the NPV and PPV . At a prevalence of 33%, which may be reflective of the most severe spikes during the course of the pandemic, the NPV of the algorithm was 95%. At a lower prevalence of 10%, this increased to more than 99%. In making an effort to use this algorithm clinically, it will be important to consider the population prevalence in the context of result interpretation.\n\n【179】### Limitations\n\n【180】It is possible that the presence of fever or acute respiratory disturbances, irrespective of causative organism or mechanism, may be driving the network beyond any direct effects attributable to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Further research comparing ECGs from patients with other types of infectious disease (eg, influenza) and COVID-19 may help elaborate this. However, a rapid screen for active infection may prove useful irrespective of cause, and the model performed similarly well across a range of heart rates. Most patients have an ECG recorded in association with an emergency department visit or hospitalization. Although many patients were not hospitalized , we do not know how many ECGs were obtained in an emergency department. Whether this test can be used to screen outpatients with minimal or no symptoms requires a prospective study. Given the heterogeneity of the population of patients, it is possible that the use of drugs that have an impact on the ECG (eg, hydroxychloroquine) may also have affected network output. However, the diverse global population receiving a wide range of therapies and treatments enhances network robustness and mitigates potential biases. Information about drug use at the time of ECG acquisition was not available for analysis. Clinical characteristics for many patients were not available, particularly for the controls—a consequence of performing an unfunded study carried out by medical volunteers in the midst of a pandemic and of international privacy regulations. The fact that some controls were obtained from patients 2 days before a COVID-positive PCR test result raises the possibility that some controls may have been infected. This may weaken test performance. Other control ECGs were obtained before September 2019, a different time period, potentially introducing confounding or other bias.\n\n【181】A general limitation with neural networks is the lack of explainability, in that the specific electrocardiographic features affecting output are not known, with the theoretical concern that methods of data acquisition or testing may be susceptible to systematic error. We were unable to identify any single dominant feature that robustly characterized network performance. Nonetheless, the reproducible performance across populations from diverse geographies suggests that the tool is robust and could be appropriately used. In addition, whereas PCR is the current standard of care for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infection, the sensitivity is estimated at only 70%, and thus it is unclear how the ECG would perform among infected patients whose PCR test result is negative.\n\n【182】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【183】Clinical sensitivity and interpretation of PCR and serological COVID-19 diagnostics for patients presenting to the hospital.\n\n【184】Finally, spectrum bias is a possibility in our cohort. There were few asymptomatic patients in the training and validation sets, so further validation of the algorithm on a nonhospitalized or asymptomatic population is necessary.\n\n【185】A practical challenge for the analysis was developing a statistical plan to estimate the confidence intervals for measures of diagnostic performance, particularly receiver operating characteristic AUC, with a wide range of cluster sizes. In particular, across all 48,186 ECGs available for analysis, cluster sizes (ie, multiple ECGs) ranged from 1 to 133, with a median of 2 and a mean of 4. Thus, whereas there was potential for overestimation of the precision with the data (ie, confidence intervals being too narrow), this likelihood would be low considering that the intraclass correlation coefficient of the model predictions was 0.57, and the change in the standard error of a proportion changes little beyond a sample size of 2000. Conservatively, a single representative ECG could be selected for each person and the precision of estimated confidence intervals would be less than ±1.3 percentage point (calculation assumes an effective sample size of 6000 and a proportion of 0.50). This relative range of precision was observed broadly over many of the diagnostic performance measures tabulated for this study. Given that this work represents the primary development of the algorithm and validation studies would be required to use the algorithm in practice, the primary tables and text focus on point estimates.\n\n【186】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【187】Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in electrocardiographic changes that may permit the AI-enhanced ECG to be used as a screening test with a high NPV (99.2%). This may permit the development of electrocardiography-based tools to rapidly screen individuals for pandemic control, especially in a clinic or hospital setting. Development of mobile technology–enabled AI-ECGs may have broader implications that may enable resumption of normal operations across society.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Initially, the pain was described as sharp and intermittent, located in the right lower quadrant. Gradually, the pain became constant and progressively more severe. The patient also noted occasional crampy pain that extended from the right lower quadrant across to the left lower abdomen. When the pain began, the patient was constipated, but over time her stools became loose. Although onset and resolution of the intermittent pain was often spontaneous, she noticed occasional onset of pain with food intake and occasional relief of pain with passage of a loose stool. She denied having nausea, vomiting, melena, hematochezia, heartburn, or dysuria. She reported losing 3.6 kg over the preceding month and slept poorly because of the abdominal pain. Before the patient came to our clinic, she sought medical attention elsewhere and was given an antispasmodic agent and a narcotic analgesic that helped to relieve her pain temporarily.\n\n【1】*   1.\n\n【2】    **_Based on the symptoms and description of the patient's pain pattern, which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?_**\n\n【3】    *   a.\n\n【4】        _Bowel infarction_\n\n【5】    *   b.\n\n【6】        _Appendicitis_\n\n【7】    *   c.\n\n【8】        _Partial small bowel obstruction_\n\n【9】    *   d.\n\n【10】        _Urinary calculus_\n\n【11】    *   e.\n\n【12】        _Peptic ulcer disease_\n\n【13】Infarction of the bowel due to vascular occlusion usually causes severe pain, and onset is precise. Our patient had a more indolent progression of pain than would likely be seen with a vascular event. Appendicitis is an acute illness, and its natural history precludes a chronic progression of symptoms. Inflammation of the parietal peritoneum due to appendicitis usually causes well-localized pain, most often in the right lower quadrant. The duration of our patient's symptoms makes this diagnosis less likely. Partial small bowel obstruction is characterized by vague, generalized abdominal discomfort and is often associated with diarrhea and/or constipation. Nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distention may occur. Our patient's symptoms and pain pattern most closely resembled this presentation. Urinary calculi cause colicky and severe pain. This pain is more likely to have a relatively sudden onset and to be unilateral. Often the pain extends into a patient's groin and may be associated with hematuria. Peptic ulcer disease often causes a burning or gnawing epigastric discomfort that is accentuated by fasting and is relieved by antacids or food. The pain may extend to the back. Because of the relief of symptoms with food intake, weight gain, rather than weight loss, may be noted in the setting of peptic ulcer disease.\n\n【14】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【15】Stomach and duodenum.\n\n【16】Our patient's pain was in the lower abdomen, crampy, and associated with weight loss.\n\n【17】The patient's medical history was remarkable for 3 malignant melanomas excised from her left lower back (thickness, 0.6 mm; 1993), right lower back (thickness, 1.37 mm; 1993), and right anterior lower leg (thickness, 0.23 mm; 1998). A squamous cell carcinoma on her perineum was treated with multiple excisions and radiation therapy in 1997. She had also been treated for at least 20 basal cell carcinomas on her face and trunk. Previous operations included bilateral tubal ligation in 1974 and a left salpingo-oophorectomy for a benign ovarian cyst in 1993.\n\n【18】Her medications were hyoscyamine (0.375 mg orally twice daily), dicyclomine (10 mg orally 4 times a day), and propoxyphene/acetaminophen (100 mg/650 mg orally every 4 hours). She lived in Arizona for most of her life. The patient had a 5-pack-year history of smoking and drank alcohol rarely. Her brother and 1 son died of Hodgkin disease; this was the only malignancy in her family.\n\n【19】On examination, the patient was thin and appeared tired. She had no costovertebral angle tenderness. Her abdomen was soft without rebound or guarding. Tenderness to deep palpation was noted in her right lower quadrant and hypogastrium, which decreased when she tensed her abdominal musculature. The patient's abdomen was not distended, and she had normal, active bowel sounds. A pelvic examination revealed only diffuse abdominal tenderness and an irregular, globular uterus.\n\n【20】*   2.\n\n【21】    **_Based on the additional information provided by her physical examination findings, which one of the following anatomical structures is most likely to be affected in this patient?_**\n\n【22】    *   a.\n\n【23】        _Solid internal organ_\n\n【24】    *   b.\n\n【25】        _Peripheral nerve_\n\n【26】    *   c.\n\n【27】        _Parietal peritoneum_\n\n【28】    *   d.\n\n【29】        _Hollow viscus_\n\n【30】    *   e.\n\n【31】        _Abdominal wall_\n\n【32】A patient's description of pain is one of the physician's most important diagnostic clues. The site, quality, frequency, severity, and duration of the pain and the exacerbating and alleviating factors in the patient's account help to narrow the diagnostic possibilities to particular anatomical structures and pathophysiological mechanisms.\n\n【33】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【34】*   Ad Hoc Committee on Cancer Pain of the American Society of Clinical Oncology\n\n【35】Cancer Pain Assessment and Treatment Curriculum Guidelines.\n\n【36】Although a patient's presentation may vary, the following general patterns may be helpful.

Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, Public Health Services , Rockville, Md March 1994\n\n【39】Irritation of the parietal peritoneum is usually precise in site and onset. Visceral pain is usually colicky or rhythmical, transmitted by sympathetic nerves, and sensed vaguely. This description fits the type of pain in our patient. Tubes of small caliber generate high pressures and severe colic, whereas tubes with a large diameter, like the intestine, generate lower pressures and less intense pain.\n\n【40】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【41】50th annual J.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 4 × 4-cm mass in the lower uterine segment, consistent with a uterine fibroid. A barium enema examination showed a filling defect in the terminal ileum.\n\n【46】*   3.\n\n【47】    **_Which one additional test would likely provide the highest diagnostic yield of the abnormality seen on this patient's barium enema examination?_**\n\n【48】    *   a.\n\n【49】        _Repeated abdominal ultrasonography_\n\n【50】    *   b.\n\n【51】        _Cystoscopy_\n\n【52】    *   c.\n\n【53】        _Sigmoidoscopy_\n\n【54】    *   d.\n\n【55】        _Small bowel radiography_\n\n【56】    *   e.\n\n【57】        _Hysteroscopy_\n\n【58】Abdominal ultrasonography is effective in evaluating solid or fluid-filled organs but is suboptimal for examining air-filled structures, such as the bowel.\n\n【59】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【60】Radiographic imaging modalities for the patient in the emergency department with abdominal complaints.\n\n【61】Cystoscopy allows direct visualization of the bladder, but previous studies did not suggest bladder disease, and the patient had not experienced dysuria. Sigmoidoscopy is not helpful in evaluating the proximal colon and terminal ileum, where a possible abnormality was found on colon radiography. Small bowel radiography yields the best visualization of the terminal ileum and is less costly and less invasive than colonoscopy, the other possible choice to evaluate these symptoms. However, colonoscopy is contraindicated if intestinal obstruction is suspected. Hysteroscopy provides visualization of the uterine cavity but is unlikely to increase the diagnostic yield in this patient who has an abnormal finding in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【62】The patient was referred for small bowel radiography, which revealed slow transit of barium through the ileum, an 8- to 10-cm segment of severe stricture of the distal ileum, and a masslike abnormality filling the cecum and proximal ascending colon. The appearance suggested ileocolonic intussusception. She was admitted to the hospital; repeated abdominal CT confirmed intussusception and revealed a 3.5-cm lead-point mass.\n\n【63】*   4.\n\n【64】    **_Which one of the following is the most appropriate management option for our patient at this time?_**\n\n【65】    *   a.\n\n【66】        _Observe her and allow no oral intake_\n\n【67】    *   b.\n\n【68】        _Perform immediate laparotomy_\n\n【69】    *   c.\n\n【70】        _Attempt reduction of the intussusception with barium enema_\n\n【71】    *   d.\n\n【72】        _Attempt reduction of the intussusception with air-contrast enema_\n\n【73】    *   e.\n\n【74】        _Perform colonoscopy with biopsy of the lead-point mass_\n\n【75】Although intussusception is relatively common in children, it is uncommon in adults, in whom 90% of the cases are secondary to a definable lesion. In the small intestine, most lead-point masses are benign. The opposite situation is true for intussusception of the colon, in which the etiology is more likely to be a malignant lead-point mass.\n\n【76】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【77】The diagnosis and management of adult intussusception.\n\n【78】Requiring that the patient take nothing by mouth is appropriate at this point; however, observation of this patient who has a large intraluminal mass would not provide a definitive diagnosis or treatment. Immediate operative management would facilitate reduction of the intussusception, diagnosis of the lead-point mass, resection of the mass and the portion of affected bowel, and sampling of regional lymph nodes, if necessary. Although most experts agree that surgical resection of intussusception in adults is necessary, the extent of resection and whether the intussusception should be reduced before resection are controversial. Attempted reduction of this intussusception with either barium or air-contrast enemas may be successful, but with a large lead-point mass suggestive of malignancy, the intussusception may recur, and no further diagnostic information would be obtained. Even if a biopsy could be performed and the intussusception reduced by colonoscopy, this approach would delay definitive treatment and could worsen tissue necrosis in the vascularly compromised intussusceptum.\n\n【79】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【80】The diagnosis and management of adult intussusception.\n\n【81】Our patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, reduction of the intussusception, and resection of the mass and approximately 20 cm of ileum. Pathologic examination of the resected mass revealed metastatic melanoma, 3.5 cm in greatest dimension, with normal lymph nodes and negative surgical margins. Subsequent testing for other sites of metastasis, including a bone scan, chest radiography, and brain magnetic resonance imaging, yielded normal findings. However, chest and abdominal CT approximately 2 months later showed multiple, suspicious, bilateral, uncalcified pulmonary nodules, the largest (1.9 cm in diameter) in the anterior left upper lobe. Percutaneous CT-guided biopsy of one of the lung nodules also revealed metastatic melanoma.\n\n【82】*   5.\n\n【83】    **_Which one of the following is the least appropriate next step in the management of this patient?_**\n\n【84】    *   a.\n\n【85】        _Thoracic surgery consultation for excision of the metastatic lung nodules_\n\n【86】    *   b.\n\n【87】        _Pastoral counseling if the patient desires_\n\n【88】    *   c.\n\n【89】        _Oncology consultation, if not already performed_\n\n【90】    *   d.\n\n【91】        _Consideration of enrolling the patient in an experimental treatment protocol_\n\n【92】    *   e.\n\n【93】        _Asking the patient to consider writing advanced directives for her future medical care_\n\n【94】Our patient has stage IV malignant melanoma. Although a single metastasis to the lung could be treated surgically, attempting to excise multiple metastatic pulmonary nodules is unlikely to be curative since the disease spread was likely hematogenous. Pastoral and oncology consultations, if not already provided, would certainly be appropriate in this setting, both to support the patient spiritually and to explain what treatment options are available. Because of the numerous treatment regimens used for stage IV melanoma and the lack of consensus regarding the superiority of one regimen over another, an experimental treatment protocol would be an option to consider for this patient.\n\n【95】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【96】A survey of treatments used in patients with metastatic melanoma: analysis of 189 patients referred to the National Cancer Institute.\n\n【97】Advanced directives are written instructions by a patient that guide caregivers regarding the type of care desired by the patient in the event that he/she is unable to make those decisions for himself/herself. Discussing advanced directives with any adult patient, especially one with a serious medical illness or one facing high-risk treatment procedures, is appropriate.\n\n【98】The previously consulted oncology team recommended treatment options, including single-agent interferon, combination chemotherapy (dacarbazine, cisplatin, vinblastine) with or without interferon and interleukin, and highdose interleukin 2 (National Cancer Institute regimen). The patient chose the interleukin 2 regimen. After 2 cycles of therapy and 1 year after her original clinic presentation, she has no evidence of disease progression.\n\n【99】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【100】Cutaneous malignant melanoma has occurred at an alarming rate over the past few decades. The incidence and mortality rates for 1973 to 1994 increased 120% and 40%, respectively. The disease tends to afflict a younger population, and the median age at diagnosis is 53 years. Approximately 1 in 4 new cases is discovered in a person younger than 40 years. Although there are primarily 6 subtypes of melanoma, with superficial spreading melanoma the most common, the prognosis for patients with the disease is irrespective of the histologic subtype and depends predominantly on tumor thickness.\n\n【101】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【102】Prevention and early detection of malignant melanoma.\n\n【103】Many factors are associated with an increased risk of the development of a cutaneous melanoma. The exact risk varies among investigators. In general, a high risk of melanoma development is conferred by a personal history of atypical moles and a family history of melanoma in a patient with more than 100 moles, previous nonmelanoma skin cancer, giant congenital nevus, personal history of melanoma, family history of melanoma in a first-degree relative, and immunosuppression. Increased risk but to a lesser degree is conferred by repeated blistering sunburns at an early age, freckling, fair skin and hair, and a single clinically atypical nevus. Other factors that increase melanoma risk include clinically atypical nevi without a family history of melanoma or sporadic atypical nevi, a large number of nevi, and long-term tanning with ultraviolet A light or treatment of other skin conditions, such as psoriasis, with psoralen plus ultraviolet A. Age younger than 10 years and nonwhite skin are associated with a lower than average risk for the development of cutaneous melanoma. Interestingly, although cumulative sun exposure correlates with nonmelanoma skin cancer, intermittent intense sun exposure seems to be more related to a risk of melanoma.\n\n【104】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【105】Prevention and early detection of malignant melanoma.\n\n【106】Although the skin may be the organ most accessible to the clinician, the diagnosis of melanoma may be delayed for several reasons. Patients may postpone medical evaluation of suspicious lesions because of fear, denial, or lack of knowledge. Moreover, when the patient with melanoma is seen by a clinician, the sensitivity of clinical diagnosis varies, ranging from 47% to 97%.\n\n【107】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【108】Neoplasms: cutaneous melanoma.\n\n【109】In any patient with a skin lesion suggestive of melanoma, a thorough history should be obtained to assess the patient's risk factors for melanoma. Benign-appearing atypical moles should be observed, and lesions suggestive of melanoma or more atypical nevi should be excised by accepted techniques.\n\n【110】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【111】Prevention and early detection of malignant melanoma.\n\n【112】Therapy for malignant melanoma depends on the stage at which it is diagnosed. However, the unpredictable biologic nature of cutaneous melanoma has hindered the development of an accurate staging system. After several early staging systems seemed inadequate for predicting prognosis in primary cutaneous melanomas, Breslow\n\n【113】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【114】Thickness, cross-sectional areas and depth of invasion in the prognosis of cutaneous melanoma.\n\n【115】hypothesized that tumor volume might better correlate with prognosis than superficial tumor diameter. He suggested that by measuring the maximal tumor thickness, the maximal cross-sectional area of the lesion could be calculated and its volume estimated. His landmark discovery of the powerful prognostic value of tumor thickness in melanoma remains the basis for the modern staging system of primary cutaneous melanoma.\n\n【116】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【117】Classification and staging of melanoma.\n\n【118】The standard treatment of primary cutaneous melanoma is complete surgical excision of the lesion, including a margin of normal tissue and extension to the muscle fascia. This approach may be definitive for melanomas that are less than 0.75 mm thick; however, sentinel lymph node biopsy or elective lymph node dissection should be considered for patients whose lesions are of intermediate thickness. A wide range of therapeutic modalities exists for treatment of regional and distant metastatic lesions, including surgery, hyperthermic regional limb perfusion, radiation therapy, biologic therapy, and numerous protocols of chemotherapy.\n\n【119】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【120】Neoplasms: cutaneous melanoma.\n\n【121】Cutaneous malignant melanoma is a serious threat to the well-being of young and old individuals. Clinical efforts should be directed at primary prevention as well as early detection and treatment to minimize the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Our patient had several risk factors for the development of malignant melanoma. She was white, had lived in an area of high sun exposure most of her life, and had numerous nonmelanoma skin cancers. Her disease was classified as stage IV because of distant metastasis, both to the gastrointestinal tract and to the lungs. Despite an unfavorable prognosis, this patient has had a good response to interleukin 2-based immunotherapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Coprescribing was 1 or more overlapping days of supply between the OAD and potential DDI drugs during the 12-month period beginning on the OAD index date. Product labels identified the cytochrome P450 metabolic enzymes used and whether P-glycoprotein was used by the OADs. Drugs that induce and/or inhibit these pathways were identified from the label and online resources.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Sample sizes ranged from 96 (pazopanib group) to 4617 (imatinib group).

Coprescribing rates with drugs that may increase OAD toxicity were 364/1546 (24%) (sunitinib group) to 71/96 (74%) (pazopanib group). Patients coprescribed DDI drugs had a median of 1 to 4 more medications present on the OAD index date than those not coprescribed a DDI drug.

Sullivan, ELS, was named Executive Editor of the _Proceedings._ Ms Sullivan has been a _Proceedings_ staff member for the past 12 years, and since 2000 had served as Senior Editor. In addition to her usual responsibilities, in 1999, she and the Mayo Division of External Communications developed and initiated a plan to disseminate _Proceedings_ content to the media. That initiative has been highly successful, resulting in lay press coverage that has reached an audience numbering in the hundreds of millions. Additionally, in 2001, Ms Sullivan introduced “Art at Mayo,” a feature of the journal that highlights works of art displayed throughout the Mayo Clinic campus in Rochester, Minn. Through these and other activities, Ms Sullivan has had a significant role in the evolution of the “new” _Mayo Clinic Proceedings._ Her leadership responsibilities will expand in her role as Executive Editor.\n\n【2】On June 17, 2002, Tamara K. Locke of Madison, Wis, was appointed Senior Editor of the _Proceedings,_ filling the position vacated by Ms Sullivan. From 1984 to 1998, Ms Locke was an editor and technical writer at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM. More recently, she worked as an independent editor, serving several prestigious medical and nonmedical scientific journals. She brings to the _Proceedings_ experience that should well serve our authors and readers as the journal publishes more hightechnology-based research.\n\n【3】Kimberly D. Sankey was appointed Assistant Managing Editor for Processing on May 8, 2002. Prior to this appointment, Ms Sankey was employed as a Medical Secretary in the Mayo Clinic Department of Anesthesiology for 20 years. Her duties included, in part, the preparation and processing of scientific manuscripts and reviews. Hence, she brings new perspectives to the _Proceedings_ review process, from the point of view of authors and of reviewers.\n\n【4】The Editorial Board is confident that these recent appointees will positively impact the quality of the journal and our interactions with authors and readers. However, our excitement is tempered by recognition that the arrival of the new appointees coincides with the departure of 2 equally talented professionals, Jane C. Lantz, ELS, and Rita E. Young.\n\n【5】Ms Lantz was _Proceedings_ Executive Editor from 1999 to 2002. During her tenure, she was responsible for revising and formalizing the journal's style, consistent with the guidelines of the _American Medical Association Manual of Style_ .\n\n【6】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【7】_American Medical Association Manual of Style_ : _A Guide for Authors and Editors_ . 9th ed.

Ms Lantz departed the _Proceedings_ to become Editor for the Mayo Clinic Section of Scientific Publications.\n\n【9】Ms Young was Assistant Managing Editor for Processing from 1984 to 2002. She was responsible for overseeing the registration, throughput, and tracking of all materials reviewed by the _Proceedings,_ as well as serving as secretary to the Editor-in-Chief. A self-taught computer expert, Ms Young also helped oversee technologic advances within the _Proceedings_ office. Working solo for many years, Ms Young teamed with Margaret R. Wentz in recent years to reorganize the processing of reviews.

We excluded patients with inflammatory bowel disease, history of colon polyps, or family history of CRC. All patients were followed up until the diagnosis of CRC or carcinoma in situ, death, or December 31, 2005. The risk of CRC after colonoscopy was compared with the risk after sigmoidoscopy or no lower endoscopy. The multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used in statistical analysis.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In the colonoscopy group (n=12,266), 58 CRCs (0.5%) were diagnosed during follow-up compared with 66 CRCs (1.0%) in the sigmoidoscopy group (n=6402) and 634 (1.5%) in the control group (n=41,410) (all _P_ <.001). In the sigmoidoscopy group, 771 patients (12.0%) underwent colonoscopy within the next 12 months.

We describe a patient who developed transient left ventricular apical ballooning (LVAB) (also called Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or “broken heart syndrome”) after cocaine use, which to our knowledge is the first such case reported in the literature.\n\n【9】REPORT OF A CASE\n----------------\n\n【10】A 54-year-old postmenopausal woman with a history of hypertension presented to the emergency department because of severe squeezing-type retrosternal chest pain that had begun 2 to 3 hours before presentation. She had no associated dyspnea, fever, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, or dizziness and no history of chest pain (on exertion or at rest) or hospitalization related to cardiovascular disease. She was not taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications and denied any recent emotional or physical distress, smoking, alcohol abuse, or family history of heart disease. She admitted smoking “crack” cocaine in progressively increasing amounts during the preceding few months and reported that her most recent use was 2 to 3 hours before the onset of symptoms.\n\n【11】On physical examination, the patient was alert and awake, had a pulse rate of 106/min, blood pressure of 184/100 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 95% while breathing room air. No jugular venous distention was evident, and cardiovascular examination revealed normal S <sub>1 </sub> and S <sub>2 </sub> with no murmurs or pericardial rub. Respiratory system evaluation revealed bilateral basal crackles. Results of the rest of the systemic examination were unremarkable.\n\n【12】Routine laboratory investigations, including a complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and thyroid and liver function tests, revealed no abnormalities. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed 2- to 3-mm ST-segment elevation in leads V <sub>2 </sub> through V <sub>5 </sub> . The creatine kinase level was 351 U/L (reference ranges shown parenthetically) (0-165 U/L) with a creatine kinase-MB fraction of 6.7 and a peak troponin I level of 8.8 ng/mL (0-1.0 ng/mL). Chest x-ray films showed mild pulmonary congestion. The B-type natriuretic peptide level was elevated at 480 pg/mL (<100 pg/mL), and a urine toxicology screen was positive for cocaine metabolites.\n\n【13】FIGURE 1 Electrocardiogram at initial presentation showing ST-segment elevation in leads V <sub>2 </sub> through V <sub>5 </sub> .\n\n【14】In view of the patient's persistent chest pain, ECG changes, and elevated cardiac enzymes, a diagnosis of ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was considered. She was treated with oxygen, aspirin, intravenous nitroglycerin, heparin, and eptifibatide and was transferred to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for primary angioplasty. Surprisingly, cardiac catheterization showed a normal coronary tree with no notable stenosis of any of the major arteries or their branches. Also, the left anteriordescending (LAD) artery did not wrap around the apex and had a short recurrent segment. Left ventricular angiography showed characteristic apical ballooning  during systole with hypercontraction of the basal region and an estimated left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 25%. There was no spontaneous coronary vasospasm, and catheter withdrawal revealed no notable intracavitary pressure gradient. The patient was admitted to the coronary care unit, and clopidogrel, carvedilol, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were administered. Her chest pain improved soon after transfer to the coronary care unit. Serial ECG showed resolution of the ST-segment elevation over the next 8 hours without the appearance of pathologic Q waves.\n\n【15】FIGURE 2 Left ventricular angiograms at end-diastolic phase (left) and end-systolic phase (right) with the latter showing aneurysmal ballooning of the apex.\n\n【16】The patient was asymptomatic for the remainder of her hospital stay. An extensive work-up for connective tissue disorders, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and other hypercoagulable states revealed no abnormalities. Plasma catecholamine levels measured on hospital day 4 for investigation of possible pheochromocytoma showed a normal norepinephrine level of 465 pg/mL (70-750 pg/mL), an epinephrine level of 68 pg/mL (0-110 pg/mL), and a dopamine level of 22 pg/mL (0-30 pg/mL). Follow-up echocardiography 4 days later showed no regional myocardial dysfunction, complete normalization of apical wall motion, and an LVEF of 60%. The patient continued to improve and was discharged home in stable condition; discharge medications included aspirin, carvedilol, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. She quit using cocaine, and echocardiography 3 months after discharge showed continued normal left ventricular function.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】Transient LVAB, also known as Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or “broken heart syndrome,” has been described by investigators worldwide.\n\n【19】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【20】Transient left ventricular apical ballooning without coronary artery stenosis: a novel heart syndrome mimicking acute myocardial infarction.\n\n【21】This syndrome is characterized by transient left ventricular apical wall motion abnormalities with hypercontraction of the basal region resulting in characteristic “ballooning” of the apex of the left ventricle. Although the clinical presentation of this condition mimics that of acute coronary syndrome (including typical chestpain, ST changes on ECG, and elevation of cardiac enzymes), cardiac catheterization reveals no major stenosis of coronary vessels. The true incidence of LVAB is unknown; in 1 series, approximately 2.2% of patients with acute ST-segment elevation coronary syndrome were diagnosed as having LVAB.\n\n【22】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【23】Clinical characteristics and thrombolysis in myocardial infarction frame counts in women in transient left ventricular apical ballooning syndrome.\n\n【24】Transient apical ballooning occurs most commonly in women between 55 and 70 years of age. Typical ECG changes include ST-segment elevation in acute phase, especially in leads V <sub>3 </sub> through V <sub>6 </sub> . Most patients develop evolutionary T-wave inversion, and some may have pathologic Q waves, new bundle branch block, or prolonged QT interval. The LVEF is usually reduced and may be as low as 10% in some patients. In a few cases, the clinical course may be complicated by cardiogenic shock, atrioventricular nodal block, ventricular arrhythmias, left ventricular free wall rupture, or mural thrombus formation. Overall, the prognosis for these patients is good, with almost complete resolution of left ventricular dysfunction in a few days to weeks. Usually, LVAB is triggered by sudden emotional and/or physical stress or by systemic disorders such as sepsis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, pheochromocytoma, status asthmaticus, or noncardiac surgery. Our patient had none of these precipitating factors. Although establishing a causal relationship is difficult, the clear and close temporal association of cocaine use and the onset of symptoms suggests that cocaine was the most likely trigger for the development of LVAB.\n\n【25】Cocaine use is associated with the development of AMI, accelerated hypertension, various arrhythmias, spontaneous aortic or coronary artery dissection, myocarditis, and papillary muscle rupture. Systemic effects of cocaine are mediated by inhibition of norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin amine reuptake in the presynaptic neurons. The resulting increase in catecholamines can cause a variety of cardiovascular dysfunctions, such as hypertension, tachycardia, coronary artery vasoconstriction, increased microvascular resistance,\n\n【26】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【27】Increased TIMI frame counts in cocaine users: a case for increased microvascular resistance in the absence of epicardial disease or spasm.\n\n【28】and increased myocardial oxygen demand. Cocaine may also enhance thrombus formation in coronary arteries secondary to its effects on platelet aggregation and thromboxane and prostacyclin production.\n\n【29】Our patient was diagnosed as having LVAB on the basis of criteria proposed by authors from the Mayo Clinic.\n\n【30】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【31】Systematic review: transient left ventricular apical ballooning: a syndrome that mimics ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.\n\n【32】Although the patient could have had cocaine-induced AMI secondary to coronary vasoconstriction (despite the absence of coronary vasospasm) and/or in situ coronary artery thrombosis, several distinct features suggest the diagnosis of LVAB. First, cocaine-induced AMI (irrespective of the underlying mechanisms) usually results in necrosis and scarring of the myocardial tissue with irreversible left ventricular dysfunction. However, in patients with LVAB, the left ventricular dysfunction resolves completely within days to weeks, as occurred in our patient. Second, the characteristic apical ballooning seen in patients with LVAB is not a common feature of AMI. In AMI, the akinetic zone usually corresponds to the perfusion territory of 1 or more obstructive epicardial vessels, except in patients who have a single LAD arterial lesion with a long recurrent branch wrapping around the apex; in such patients, left ventriculography may reveal apical ballooning similar to that seen in LVAB.\n\n【33】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【34】Tako-tsubo transient left ventricular apical ballooning is associated with a left anterior descending coronary artery with a long course along the apical diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle \\[in Spanish\\].\n\n【35】Our patient did not have such anatomy. Third, although cocaine-induced coronary vasospasm (multiartery) may possibly result in a similar clinical picture, it is difficult to explain why multiple vasospasms would affect the same large apical portion of the left ventricle. Finally, the discrepancy between the extent of akinesia and the minimal increase in cardiac enzymes seen in our patient makes cocaine-induced AMI an unlikely cause of her left ventricular dysfunction.\n\n【36】Cocaine use has been linked to the development of both ischemic and nonischemic (normal epicardial coronary arteries) cardiomyopathy. Wiener et al\n\n【37】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【38】Dilated cardiomyopathy and cocaine abuse: report of two cases.\n\n【39】reported 2 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy associated with chronic cocaine use. In addition, global and reversible left ventricular dysfunction (with normal coronary arteries) associated with short-term cocaine use has also been reported.\n\n【40】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【41】Reversible cardiomyopathy associated with cocaine intoxication.\n\n【42】In our patient, unlike in previous reports, left ventricular dysfunction was transient and was limited to the left ventricular apex (with hypercontraction of the basal region). Since the pathogenesis of LVAB has been linked to high circulating levels of catecholamines with resulting myocyte injury and/or microvascular dysfunction,\n\n【43】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【44】Neurohumoral features of myocardial stunning due to sudden emotional stress.\n\n【45】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【46】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【47】Assessment of Takotsubo (ampulla) cardiomyopathy using 99mTc-tetrofosmin myocardial SPECT—comparison with acute coronary syndrome.\n\n【48】it seems logical that a heightened adrenergic state secondary to short-term and/or long-term cocaine use may also result in the development of LVAB in susceptible individuals.\n\n【49】Various mechanisms have been implicated for nonischemic left ventricular dysfunction (including dilated cardiomyopathy and possibly LVAB) associated with short-term and/or long-term cocaine use. Long-term use can result in a wide array of histochemical abnormalities in myocytes and may alter myocyte ultrastructure by its direct toxic effects. Conversely, short-term cocaine use can cause transient coronary microvascular dysfunction in the absence of epicardial disease or vasospasm. In addition, elevated catecholamines may cause cyclic adenosine monophosphate-mediated calcium overload and myocardial injury,\n\n【50】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【51】Adrenergic effects on the biology of the adult mammalian cardiocyte.\n\n【52】similar to the acute (and potentially reversible) “toxic” cardiomyopathy seen in patients with pheochromocytoma. Some studies have shown that increased oxidative stress is an early triggering event of cocaine-induced myocardial injury. In rat ventricular myocytes, catecholamines can cause a reactive oxygen species-dependent apoptosis of myocytes by stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors.\n\n【53】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【54】β-Adrenergic receptor-stimulated apoptosis in cardiac myocytes is mediated by reactive oxygen species/c-Jun NH <sub>2 </sub> \\-terminal kinase-dependent activation of the mitochondrial pathway.\n\n【55】Also, stimulation of α <sub>1 </sub> \\-adrenergic receptors may contribute to cocaine-induced myocardial dysfunction through NADPH oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species production, which can be prevented by the α-adrenergic receptor-blocking agent prazosin.\n\n【56】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【57】Role of α-adrenoreceptors in cocaine-induced NADPH oxidase expression and cardiac dysfunction.\n\n【58】Some authors have suggested that cocaine may also cause left ventricular dysfunction by promoting myocardial inflammation. In the mouse heart, cocaine enhances inflammatory cell infiltration via catecholamine-induced upregulation of cell adhesion molecule expression, including intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (E-selectin), and leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (L-selectin).\n\n【59】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【60】Cocaine and catecholamines enhance inflammatory cell retention in the coronary circulation of mice by upregulation of adhesion molecules.\n\n【61】Moreover, β-adrenergic blockade by propranolol inhibits the effects of cocaine on cell adhesion molecule expression and decreases adhesion of neutrophils to the coronary endothelium. These observations suggest that cocaine-induced nonischemic cardiomyopathy (and possibly LVAB) is mediated primarily by increased circulating catecholamines, resulting in myocardial dysfunction due to multiple pathogenic mechanisms.\n\n【62】Although cocaine use may result in left ventricular dysfunction or cardiomyopathy, it is still unclear why cocaine use in our patient would cause preferential contractile dysfunction of the apex resulting in LVAB.

Moreover, microvascular dysfunction secondary to excess catecholamines may be more profound in the ventricular apex compared to the basal part of the heart in patients with LVAB. One study showed that left ventriculography in patients with AMI secondary to stenosis or occlusion of an LAD artery that wraps around the apex and has a long recurrent segment may reveal a pattern similar to that seen in patients with LVAB.\n\n【66】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【67】Tako-tsubo transient left ventricular apical ballooning is associated with a left anterior descending coronary artery with a long course along the apical diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle \\[in Spanish\\].\n\n【68】The authors also reported that intravascular ultrasonography in 5 patients with LVAB showed that all of them had a long recurrent segment of the LAD artery and a single ruptured nonobstructive atherosclerotic plaque in the middle portion of the artery.\n\n【69】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【70】Tako-tsubo transient left ventricular apical ballooning: is intravascular ultrasound the key to resolve the enigma? \\[letter\\].\n\n【71】They suggested that LVAB could be a result of acute plaque rupture in the LAD artery supplying a large apical portion of the left ventricle, with early recanalization (either spontaneously or secondary to antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy) and resultant myocardial stunning. Although their findings may suggest that the pathogenesis of LVAB could be related to acute plaque rupture (probably secondary to excessive catecholamines), development of this syndrome in patients without the specific LAD arterial anatomy they described (as in our patient) remains unexplained. Moreover, if LVAB is merely a variant of acute coronary syndrome with early reperfusion, it is difficult to explain why these patients have substantially higher catecholamine levels compared with those in patients with AMI.\n\n【72】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【73】Neurohumoral features of myocardial stunning due to sudden emotional stress.\n\n【74】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【75】Our case emphasizes the importance of recognizing LVAB, an uncommon but important cardiovascular condition secondary to sudden emotional or physical stress, and its possible association with cocaine use. Unfortunately, LVAB currently is recognized retrospectively after cardiac catheterization in most patients, and no established test exists to reliably diagnose this entity before catheterization. The pathophysiology of LVAB is not fully understood, and its association with cocaine use may provide further insight into understanding this condition.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Fait accompli. On to this narrative has been grafted the hopes that telemedicine will solve other persistent problems, particularly in primary care.\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】Retooling Primary Care in the COVID-19 Era.\n\n【3】As with any other technology, the divine is in the details.\n\n【4】What Problems in Primary Care Are in Need of a Fix?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The challenges for primary care are deep and structural. Inequity in payment for cognitive versus procedural care\n\n【6】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【7】Medicare payment for cognitive vs procedural care: minding the gap.\n\n【8】 conflating how primary care has been valued with its value; equating the payment allocated for primary care services with the difficulty in their mastery (contributing to the assumption that lesser training is of little consequence in primary care); and a shrinking scope of practice for physicians within the specialty are among the reasons our health system has not benefitted fully from what a well-supported, well-organized model of primary care has to offer.\n\n【9】Can Telemedicine Fix What Ails Primary Care?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Certainly, telemedicine cannot solve the structural causes above, but can it improve capacity and access while also reducing time pressure and burnout? If this is possible, what are physicians and their teams doing during now in-person visits that is not necessary and could be eliminated? Arguably, it should require even more time rather than less to accurately read the fewer signals available from patients during a video visit and to be sure that the real reason for the visit, the third or fourth complaint, reaches the surface.\n\n【11】Learning From Electronic Health Record Transformation\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Twenty years ago, electronic health records (EHRs) were anticipated as a technology that would improve quality, efficiency, and professional mastery. All of our patients’ information would be at our fingertips whether we were at the clinic, the hospital, or at home. Clinical decision support, pop-up reminders, and hard-stops during order entry would make us better physicians.\n\n【13】And yet the EHR was not the savior of primary care,\n\n【14】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【15】*   Sinsky CA. E-nirvana:\n\n【16】are we there yet?\n\n【17】but instead, for all of its benefits, its burdens fell disproportionately to primary care physicians. Many tasks take more time when performed on the EHR.\n\n【18】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【19】Tethered to the EHR: primary care physician workload assessment using EHR event log data and time-motion observations.\n\n【20】In addition, with the mistaken beliefs that technology will allow the physician to do other role types, work and that this work can magically be accomplished in the interstitial time between other work, time pressure for physicians intensified after EHR implementations. Tasks previously managed by receptionists, transcriptionists, medical records clerks, et cetera, have been shifted to physicians; work has spilled over into home,\n\n【21】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【22】Allocation of physician time in ambulatory practice: a time and motion study in 4 specialties.\n\n【23】stealing time from family, friends, and personal well-being\n\n【24】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【25】Electronic health records and burnout: Time spent on the electronic health record after hours and message volume associated with exhaustion but not with cynicism among primary care clinicians.\n\n【26】 and the EHR provided vastly more opportunities for monitoring, measuring,\n\n【27】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【28】US physician practices spend more than $15.4 billion annually to report quality measures.\n\n【29】reprimanding, and penalizing physicians.\n\n【30】Going Forward\n-------------\n\n【31】What are the lessons learned that could ensure that similar stumbles do not befall the promising technology of telemedicine?\n\n【32】### Design, Implement, and Regulate With Teams in Mind\n\n【33】In each encounter, whether in-person or video, there is too much to be done by just one person, and it is too important to leave to chance. The doctor cannot single-handedly do all the work of the visit and do it well; this mindset blinded many to the risks to patient safety, patient trust, and professional well-being associated with many EHR implementations. There is no need to repeat those mistakes with telemedicine.\n\n【34】### Recognize That Multitasking is Hazardous\n\n【35】Providing patients undivided attention is one of the most powerful tools in any physician’s toolkit. Multitasking, which is really task switching,\n\n【36】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【37】Quantifying the impact of health IT implementations on clinical workflow: a new methodological perspective.\n\n【38】is hazardous. During a remote visit, because there are fewer cues to read, the physician must be fully attentive to all available, rather than simultaneously transcribing the visit note, entering orders, sending medications to the pharmacy, ticking off performance measures, and composing the billing invoice. Humans have a finite cognitive bandwidth; the more time spent on clerical tasks, the less available for deep clinical work.\n\n【39】### Prioritize Relationships\n\n【40】Health care is not just a series of transactions for which anybody will do, but is built on relationships. Diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic adherence are greater, and waste reduced, in the context of a trusting ongoing relationship.\n\n【41】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【42】Care fragmentation, quality, and costs among chronically ill patients.\n\n【43】Telemedicine is not inherently transactional, and by bringing the physician and team closer into patients’ lives it can support and enhance relationships. To realize this potential, however, a priority must be placed on continuity and relationships.\n\n【44】### Practice Truth in Time Accounting\n\n【45】It is important to avoid thinking that a physician can somehow do more in less time during video rather than in-person visits. Work that physicians and others perform outside of the encounter is still work and takes time. Likewise, work that occurs at home is work, and deserves to be counted. Some tasks are quicker when done with a technology assist and at other times work on a technology platform can take more time. It all needs to be counted and understood.\n\n【46】### Invest in the Science of Practice\n\n【47】Teamwork, planning, and efficient workflows are essential. Not every problem is best suited to a technological fix. In fact, technology, such as artificial intelligence,\n\n【48】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【49】Retooling Primary Care in the COVID-19 Era.\n\n【50】used to compensate for an underlying disorganized system of care\n\n【51】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【52】Retooling Primary Care in the COVID-19 Era.\n\n【53】can be cumbersome and costly.\n\n【54】For example, appropriately scheduling patients from the outset saves time and improves patient experience. At the end of today’s appointment, the team can set up the next appointment, with all associated tests for prevention and chronic illness monitoring, customized to this particular patient, accommodating the patient’s preference for an in-person or virtual appointment.\n\n【55】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【56】Putting pre-visit planning into practice.\n\n【57】No need then for a last-minute “schedule sweep”\n\n【58】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【59】Retooling Primary Care in the COVID-19 Era.\n\n【60】to cancel the patient after an algorithm deemed their appointment unnecessary.\n\n【61】Likewise, centralizing population health as the primary vehicle for prevention and chronic illness care can be an unnecessary source of further fragmentation,\n\n【62】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【63】Care fragmentation, quality, and costs among chronically ill patients.\n\n【64】depersonalization, and waste within the health care system. Instead, using an organized system of care, all of the patient’s annual needs for prevention and chronic illness monitoring can be arranged at a single, coordinated appointment rather than being fragmented, with the patient contacted 1 month for their mammogram, the next month for their pneumococcal vaccine, and at yet another time for their urine test for microalbumin. A registry, whether managed centrally or more personally at the local level by the patient’s team, can catch those patients who fall through the cracks of an organized system, but to use it as the primary vehicle by which to manage populations is cumbersome and reduces customization at the level of the individual experience.\n\n【65】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【66】During the storm that is coronavirus disease 2019, telemedicine arrived with a bang and is thankfully here to stay. It will take time to understand all of its risks and benefits, the appropriate patients for in-person versus virtual care, and to develop the optimal models of teamwork for this platform. Let us not repeat the mistakes encountered when EHR implementations were anticipated through rose colored glasses, but rather look with clear eyes to the lessons from the past generation’s technology challenges.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Her father was the Reverend Elijah Makiwane (1850-1928), a pioneer clergyman and the second black minister trained in South Africa to be ordained in the Presbyterian Church. Cecilia never really knew her mother, Maggie Majiza, who died in 1883 when Cecilia was only 2 years old; she had been an assistant teacher at a girls’ school in the Lovedale Missionary Institute in Alice.\n\n【1】Cecilia Makiwane worked as a ward nurse for several years at the Victoria Hospital, a mission hospital that was part of the Lovedale mission in Alice. The hospital had been founded in 1898, but it was closed briefly during the Boer War (1899-1902) and was reopened at the close of hostilities in 1902. The South African colonial nursing college in Kimberley (founded in 1877) did not admit black students during this period, but in 1903, the Victoria Hospital instituted a 3-year nursing course. Two black students enrolled in this small program, one of whom was Cecilia Makiwane. Makiwane completed the program and passed the Cape Colonial Medical Council examination in 1907. On January 7, 1908, she became the first black woman on the entire continent of Africa to be licensed as a nurse.\n\n【2】Makiwane never married and became known for her diligence to her ward nursing duties. Her work soon took a great toll on her emotionally and physically, and the hospital eventually granted her an extended leave of absence to recuperate from an unspecified illness. She went to stay with her older sister Daisy (another pioneer—the first African woman to earn a degree in mathematics), but she never recovered from her ailments. Cecilia died in Thaba ‘Nchu, a small town near Bloemfontein in the former Orange Free State, shortly before the birth of her niece, Noni Jabavu (1919-), a well-known novelist. More than 2000 people attended the unveiling of a statue of Cecilia Makiwane at the Victoria Hospital in 1977. Nurses in South Africa have traditionally held a day of prayer on January 7 to commemorate Makiwane and the state registration of black professional nurses.\n\n【3】Named in her honor, the Cecilia Makiwane Hospital is a 1450-bed facility in East London (Mdantsane), South Africa, less than 60 miles from Alice. Under the system of apartheid, it was a hospital for black patients only, and in the new South Africa, it remains so by default. A British Broadcasting Corporation report described the underfunded hospital as “a decrepit building of crumbling walls and leaking roofs, where open drains carry dirty water past overcrowded wards,” and metal gates are needed to keep criminals from entering the hospital to steal blankets and medicine.\n\n【4】Cecilia Makiwane was honored philatelically (Scott No. 34) by Ciskei in 1982. Ciskei was a brief-lived, nominal republic (never recognized internationally), 1 of 4 quasi-independent black “homelands” in South Africa under apartheid. It was inhabited primarily by Xhosa peoples, who were relocated there in large numbers in the 1970s. Ciskei was so named because it is on the “cis-” side of the Kei River relative to Cape Town, South Africa; across the river, on the far or “trans-” side, was the republic of Transkei. (Ironically, “Kei” is actually a Khoisan word; the Xhosa call the river “Nciba.”) Ciskei and Transkei, like other “homelands,” ceased to exist with the legal end of apartheid in the early 1990s. In April 1994, the territory became part of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The popularity of bariatric surgery in the treatment of extreme obesity has raised awareness of the unique considerations in the care of this patient population. Minimizing the risk of perioperative complications that contribute to morbidity and mortality requires input from several clinical disciplines and begins with the preoperative assessment of the patient. Airway management, intravenous fluid administration, physiologic responses to pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic procedures, and the risk of thrombotic complications and peripheral nerve injuries in extremely obese patients are among the factors that present special intraoperative challenges that affect postoperative recovery of the bariatric patient. Early recognition of perioperative complications and education of the patient regarding postoperative issues, including nutrition and vitamin supplementation therapy, can improve patient outcomes.

Macleod—Nobel Prize for Discovery of Insulin\n**A** lthough Canadian surgeon Frederick G. Banting (1891-1941) and Canadian physiologist Charles H. Best (1899-1978) are given credit for the discovery of insulin, Scottish physiologist John James Rickard Macleod shared the 1923 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine for “his discovery of insulin.” A stamp (Scott No. 3701) issued in 2002 by Guyana honored Macleod as a Nobel laureate.\n\n【1】Macleod, the son of a clergyman, was born on September 6, 1876, in Cluny, near Dienkeld, Perthshire, in central Scotland. He received his early education at Aberdeen Grammar School (northeastern Scotland). In 1893, he enrolled in Marischal College of the University of Aberdeen to study medicine and received MB and ChB degrees in 1898. Macleod was awarded an Anderson Traveling Fellowship that enabled him to spend 1899 at the Institute of Physiology of the University of Leipzig (Germany), where he studied biochemistry.\n\n【2】Macleod returned to England and obtained a position as demonstrator in physiology at the London Hospital Medical School in 1899. He was appointed lecturer in biochemistry at the same institution in 1902 and was also selected as Mackinnon research scholar of The Royal Society. That same year, he was awarded a DPH degree from Cambridge University (England).\n\n【3】After he received his doctorate in public health, Macleod was appointed professor of physiology at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where he remained until 1918. While at Western Reserve University, he became interested (1905) in diabetes and began investigating the metabolism of carbohydrates, particularly the physiology of diabetes mellitus. He also investigated air sickness, electric shock, purine bases, carbamates, and bacterium that causes tuberculosis.\n\n【4】In 1918, Macleod joined the University of Toronto (Canada) as associate dean of medicine and subsequently became director of its physiology laboratory. In May 1921, Macleod gave Banting permission to use the laboratory for his research on insulin.\n\n【5】Best, who was an undergraduate medical student in Macleod's classes, joined Banting, and together they began investigating the secretions of the pancreas. Eventually (1921), Banting and Best succeeded in isolating and purifying insulin. The name “insulin” was provided by Macleod, who changed the original name “insuline,” suggested by the British physiologist Edward A. Sharpey-Schafer (1850-1935), who had been one of the first investigators to support the hypothesis of a pancreatic hormone. During this time, Macleod was made dean of the faculty of medicine at the University of Toronto.\n\n【6】The Canadian researchers were aware of the work of German physician Joseph von Mering (1849-1908) and German physiologist Oskar Minkowski (1858-1931), who in 1889 announced their discovery that removal of the pancreas in dogs led to their death.\n\n【7】Controversy surrounded the 1923 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine because it was awarded only to Banting and Macleod. Banting suggested that Best also be included. Although Best was never added as a recipient, Banting shared the prize money with him. Many historians believe that Macleod should not have been awarded the prize because he had little or nothing to do with the actual work on insulin. Macleod credited the work done on the project by Canadian biochemist James Bertram Collip (1892-1965), who assisted in the purification of insulin.\n\n【8】In 1928, Macleod was appointed Regius Professor of Physiology at the University of Aberdeen. On March 16, 1935, after years of crippling arthritis, Macleod died in Aberdeen at the age of 58 years. He was honored by many scientific groups and societies. Among his numerous publications are _Practical Physiology_ (1903), _Physiology and Biochemistry in Modern Medicine_ (1918), _Insulin and Its Use in Diabetes_ (1925), and _Carbohydrate Metabolism and Insulin_ (1926).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Robin Warren: \nBorn June 11, 1937, in North Adelaide, South Australia, John Robin Warren was a fifth generation South Australian. His father studied viticulture and became one of Australia's leading wine makers. His maternal grandfather, Sydney Verco, was a physician, but died young, leaving his wife without sufficient financial support to educate their 4 children. Nonetheless, she managed to send all of them to private schools, including a son, Luke, who studied medicine.\n\n【1】Although Warren's mother was a nurse and had wanted to be a physician, she did not advise her son to study medicine. Instead his uncle Luke, a captain in the Army Medical Corps during World War II and subsequently a rural general practitioner, influenced young Warren. As a youth, Warren often rode his bicycle through the Adelaide hills where he took many photographs and became an accomplished landscape photographer, which developed into a lifelong hobby.\n\n【2】Warren graduated from St. Peter's College (a well-known academic secondary school in Adelaide) and received a Commonwealth government scholarship. He gained admission to the Medical School of Adelaide University in 1955 despite a personal history of grand mal seizures caused by epilepsy.\n\n【3】During medical school, he met and married a fellow medical student, Winifred Williams, who ultimately became a well-respected psychiatrist. Warren wanted to become a registrar in psychiatry but was unsuccessful in obtaining a position, so he settled on being a registrar in clinical pathology at the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, which was attached to the Royal Adelaide Hospital. In practice this consisted mainly of laboratory hematology, which included the interpretation of peripheral blood smears and bone marrows. He became a temporary lecturer in pathology at Adelaide University where he studied morbid anatomy and histopathology.\n\n【4】He then became a Clinical Pathology Registrar at the Royal Melbourne Hospital. Following 2 years of training he passed the exams in hematology and microbiology. This was followed by further training in morbid anatomy and histopathology. After 4 years of study in Melbourne, he obtained a position as pathologist at the Royal Perth Hospital at the University of Western Australia in 1968.\n\n【5】During the 1970s Warren became interested in gastric biopsies. In 1979, he first noted that bacteria were growing on the surface of a gastric biopsy. He collected many gastric biopsies over the next 2 years and noted the frequent presence of chronic gastritis and “curved” bacteria in the biopsy. Normal biopsies from the gastric antrum were uncommon, but he eventually found 20 normal biopsies and they did not show the bacteria. In 1981, he met Barry J. Marshall, a resident in gastroenterology who was looking for a research project. Warren had identified a number of patients with the curved bacteria present in their biopsies and needed someone to determine the type of clinical disease that they might have. Marshall was interested and concentrated on the patients who had undergone gastric biopsy.\n\n【6】In 1984, Marshall and Warren reported that spiral or “curved” bacilli were present in specimens from 58 patients with chronic, active gastritis, duodenal ulcer, or gastric ulcer. Bacilli cultured from 11 of these biopsies were gram negative, flagellate and microaerophilic, and appeared to be a new species related to the genus _Campylobacter._ They stated that these bacteria were present in almost all patients with active, chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer, or gastric ulcer and that they might be an important factor in the etiology of these diseases. Treatment of these patients with antibiotics resulted in disappearance of the bacteria and healing of the ulcer. They also reported that eradication of the bacteria markedly reduced the relapse rate of duodenal ulcer.\n\n【7】The medical community finally recognized the role of _Helicobacter_ (as the bacteria was renamed in 1989) after Marshall self-experimented by drinking a culture of the “curved” bacilli in 1984. This resulted in nausea, vomiting, and achlorydria. A gastric biopsy revealed severe gastritis and the presence of the organism. He then took antibiotics and recovered.\n\n【8】Warren also helped in the development of the <sup>14 </sup> C-urea breath-test for detecting _H. pylori_ in peptic ulcer patients in 1989.\n\n【9】Warren and Marshall were subsequently invited to speak at many medical meetings throughout the world. Warren's wife, Winifred, developed a carcinoma of the pancreas and died in 1997. Warren retired shortly thereafter. J. Robin Warren and Barry J.

Watson: Sherlock Holmes’ Companion and Biographer\nFew fictional characters are as well recognized around the world as the London-based crime-solving duo of “consulting detective” Sherlock Holmes and his loyal confidant Dr John Watson, created in 1887 by British writer Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930). Watson and Holmes’ literary association spanned 40 years, from their first appearance in _A Study in Scarlet: Being a Reprint from the Reminiscences of John H. Watson, M.D. Late of the Army Medical Department_ to _The Adventure of Shoscombe Old Place,_ published in _The Strand Magazine_ in 1927.\n\n【1】Doyle was not always careful with details or consistency between his stories, leading to some contradictory information across the Holmes-Watson narratives, including ambiguity in basic biographic information. For instance, Watson’s first name is stated to be “John” on 3 occasions (including the subtitle to _A Study in Scarlet_ ), but his wife Mary calls him “James” in _The Man with the Twisted Lip –_ which some commentators have suggested is not an authorial slip-up, but instead either a pet name she had for him, or an Anglicization of the Scottish “Hamish,” which may have been Watson’s middle name. The chronology of Holmes’ and Watson’s shared lodging, sequence of cases, and Watson’s marriages have challenged scholars for nearly a century.\n\n【2】Watson was most likely born in 1852. He attended public school in England and may have spent a portion of his childhood in Australia. He studied medicine at St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, graduated from the University of London in 1878, and after training at Netley Hospital in Hampshire (home of the British Army Medical School until 1902) joined the 5 <sup>th </sup> Northumberland Fusiliers as an assistant surgeon. He was athletic and played rugby for Blackheath Football Club in London in his youth, prior to his military service.\n\n【3】Young Dr Watson served in Afghanistan in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, joining his regiment at Kandahar in the Spring of 1880, and was soon attached to the 66 <sup>th </sup> (Berkshire) Regiment of Foot. In July 1880, he was wounded in the left shoulder by a “jezail bullet” (jezails were long smooth-bore muskets favored by Pashtun tribesmen) during the Battle of Maiwand. He was rescued from the battlefield by his courageous orderly, Murray. Subsequent stories make it unclear whether Watson’s leg was injured in addition to his shoulder. After suffering enteric fever (ie, typhoid) while recovering from his combat wounds in a hospital in Peshawar, Watson was sent as an invalid back to England on the Royal Navy troopship _HMS Orontes_ , discharged from the Army due to poor health, and given a temporary pension. By the time he returned to London and took up residence in a hotel, he had “neither kith nor kin in England,” as his father and older brother had died. He did inherit his father’s gold watch, but apparently not much else.\n\n【4】The year after his return to England, Watson was introduced to consulting detective Sherlock Holmes by a mutual friend, Watson’s old surgical dresser, a man named Stamford. The two decided to split living expenses and share a flat at 221B Baker Street in the Marylebone district of the City of Westminster in London. Watson became a keen observer of Holmes’ habits and soon began to accompany Holmes on many of his detective adventures. After Watson became upset that Scotland Yard police took all of the credit for resolution of the case described in _A Study in Scarlet_ despite Holmes’ critical part in solving it, with Holmes’ permission Watson began to chronicle some of Holmes’ cases, in many of which Watson played a key role.\n\n【5】Watson’s conventional Victorian personality traits and sense of duty, discretion, and honor coupled well with his desire for adventure and his enjoyment of collaboration with Holmes on dangerous escapades. While Watson never fully learned to employ Holmes’ deductive techniques, his observations and insights often helped Holmes find a solution to a perplexing problem, and Watson provided physical aid on numerous occasions - sometimes using his service revolver.\n\n【6】In 1889, Watson married Mary Morstan, a governess who was the daughter of a captain in the British Army who had been stationed in India. Captain Morstan’s mysterious disappearance was explored in _The Sign of the Four_ . A few years later, Mary died of unknown causes and Watson returned to living with Holmes on Baker Street. Another wife for Watson is alluded to in several stories and Watson moved off Baker Street in 1902, but this second wife is not named or described in detail.\n\n【7】Watson did have a private medical practice, but like that of author Doyle, it seems to have been not especially demanding. He criticized Holmes’ use of cocaine, and often expressed concern about the degree of mental or physical strain his friend appeared to be under during cases or while restlessly awaiting a new case. The most common remedy Watson applied seems to have been brandy, sometimes supplemented by ammonia, as when resuscitating a man who had been suffocated with poison gas in _The Greek Interpreter._ After being shocked into unconsciousness by Holmes’ surprising return after the great detective had presumably fallen to his death over the Reichenbach falls, Watson himself had to be resuscitated with brandy by Holmes.\n\n【8】The above description of Watson’s biography reflects statements in the 56 short stories and 4 novels by Doyle that have collectively become known as the “Sherlock Holmes Canon” and which have been the subject of numerous scholarly articles, as well as books and conferences organized by enthusiasts – including the _Baker Street Irregulars_ society that formed in 1934 and its numerous scion societies, who treat Holmes and Watson as real historical people. Watson himself referred to having notes on “hundreds of cases,” most of which he never published, either from lack of time or the need to protect the privacy of involved persons (Watson frequently changed details in his case reports out of a sense of discretion).\n\n【9】Doyle’s stories have spawned numerous pastiches and homages, and have been adapted for television series or films more than 100 times over the last century. One of the most popular adaptations was the BBC One television series “Sherlock,” which reimagines Holmes and Watson in contemporary London; this series debuted in 2010. Holmes and Watson have strongly influenced the literary detective genre, which is populated by detective duos, such as Agatha Christie’s Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings (also an Army veteran); Colin Dexter’s Inspector Morse and Sergeant Lewis; and Alan Hunter’s George Gently and John Bacchus.\n\n【10】More than 20 countries have depicted Sherlock Holmes on postage stamps. The first was Nicaragua in 1972 (Scott #C812), as part of a series featuring 12 fictional detectives – Holmes was the subject of the highest-value stamp. Holmes has been accompanied occasionally in these philatelic images by Dr Watson, such as in Great Britain’s 1993 _Five Sherlock Holmes Stories_ issue, one of which depicts Watson and Holmes in the 1893 story, “The Adventure of the Reigate Squire” . In August 2020, Royal Mail issued a set of stamps commemorating the _Sherlock_ BBC series; one stamp in this series shows Martin Freeman, the actor who plays Watson, in a scene from the episode _A Study in Pink_ .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Patients with smoldering WM, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with an IgG or IgA monoclonal protein, and those with an IgM monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance were excluded. The peripheral blood smears, bone marrow aspirates, and biopsy specimens were reviewed by an experienced hematopathologist.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Twenty-two patients were identified as having WM. The age-adjusted incidence rate for males was 0.92 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.44-1.39 per 100,000 person-years) and for females was 0.30 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.08-0.53 per 100,000 person-years) with an age- and sex-adjusted incidence of 0.57 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0.33-0.81 per 100,000 person-years).

Patients were contacted 30 days after discharge to determine hospital readmissions, recurrent LGIB, and death. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to describe associations of variables with 30-day readmissions or recurrent LGIB. Logistic regression was used to determine association with mortality.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】There were 277 patients hospitalized with LGIB. Of the 271 patients surviving to discharge, 21% (n=57) were readmitted within 30 days, 21 of whom were admitted for recurrent LGIB.

Despite this fact, Rowntree remains a relatively little-known figure in the history of North American medicine.\n\n【1】### Early Years and the Influence of William Osler\n\n【2】Leonard Rowntree was born in London, Ontario, in 1883. He entered Western Ontario Medical School in 1901, interned at Victoria Hospital in 1905, and entered into general practice in New Jersey in 1906. In 1907, the young general practitioner traveled to Philadelphia, Pa, to hear William Osler, the most prominent physician in the English-speaking world, lecture at the College of Pharmacy. Rowntree recalls half a century later, “I was thrilled, and at \\[the lecture's\\] close had the opportunity to meet \\[Osler\\] personally.” That same night, Rowntree wrote Osler a letter, telling him that he had decided to give up general practice and become an academic physician. Rowntree had so much confidence in Osler after hearing and meeting him that he wrote to Osler, “Whatever you advise, I will do my best to carry out.”\n\n【3】In 1958, looking back on this important juncture in his life, Rowntree saw himself as being “immersed in \\[general practice\\] to the point where I had no time left for study,” exemplifying his career-long concern for preserving time for research as well as for patient care. (Indeed, it may safely be said that to Rowntree, research became more important than patient care as the years progressed.) Osler promptly stated in a return letter that Rowntree should study at Johns Hopkins for at least 6 years. Rowntree went to Johns Hopkins that same year and because he carried Osler's letter, was accepted there.\n\n【4】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【5】Amid Masters of Twentieth Century Medicine. Charles C Thomas , Springfield, Ill 1958\n\n【6】### Johns Hopkins\n\n【7】Rowntree became an assistant to Dr John J. Abel, the famous pharmacologist. Just as Osler was always Rowntree's clinical “guiding star,” Abel became for him the embodiment of the researcher. Rowntree's work with Abel was both fundamental and far-reaching. Together, they introduced the phthalein compounds to the medical world. In 1910, Rowntree and Dr John T. Geraghty were the first to describe the use of these chemicals for the determination of renal function.\n\n【8】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【9】The phenolsulphonephthalein test for estimating renal function.\n\n【10】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【11】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【12】An experimental and clinical study of the functional activity of the kidneys by means of phenolsulphonephthalein.\n\n【13】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【14】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【15】The phthalein test.\n\n【16】This “Rowntree test” was a clinical standard for the next 30 years.\n\n【17】Abel and Rowntree also developed the first artificial kidney in animal research, reporting their success with the apparatus in 1913.\n\n【18】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【19】On the removal of diffusible substances from the circulating blood by means of dialysis.\n\n【20】That same year, Rowntree presented an article with Dr Norman Keith (who later became a member of Rowntree's group at the Mayo Clinic) about a vital red dye method for determining blood and plasma volumes. This test also remained a standard for decades.\n\n【21】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【22】A method for the determination of plasma and blood volume.\n\n【23】Finally, Abel and Rowntree devised the first successful method of plasmapheresis in dogs.\n\n【24】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【25】Plasma removal with return of corpuscles.\n\n【26】In 1914, after spending 6 years in the laboratory, Rowntree became active in teaching clinical medicine as an associate professor under Theodore Janeway, Chief of Medicine at Johns Hopkins.\n\n【27】### University of Minnesota\n\n【28】In 1915, Rowntree accepted an offer to become Chairman of Medicine at the University of Minnesota, but World War I cut short his work there. He entered the US Army in 1918, where he became interested in aviation medicine, studying aviation accidents and the effects of altitude on health. Rowntree also helped develop a school for flight surgeons.\n\n【29】### The Mayo Clinic\n\n【30】After returning from the war, Rowntree declined numerous offers in order to accept William J. Mayo's invitation to work at the Mayo Clinic. On his arrival in Rochester, Minn, in 1920, Rowntree was made Head of Section and Professor of Medicine of the Mayo Foundation. By this time, Rowntree and W. J. Mayo knew each other well, Mayo having already saved Rowntree's life by performing surgery on him for a perforated ulcer in 1918. In January 1922, Rowntree was given the title of Chief of the Department of Medicine, the Mayo Foundation.\n\n【31】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【32】Physicians of the Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation. WB Saunders Co , Philadelphia, Pa 1927\n\n【33】At this point, Rowntree recruited men to Rochester who would later be known as the “Rowntree Group”: “I contacted immediately Dr. Norman Keith of Toronto, Dr. Samuel Amberg of Chicago, and Dr. Reginald Fitz of Boston, all of whom had been collaborators with me at Hopkins, and Dr. Henry Helmholtz, the pediatrician. … Later were added Dr. George Brown from Miles City, Montana, and Dr. Walter Alvarez from San Francisco. Dr. Russell Wilder, already on the clinic staff, was also brought into the fold.”\n\n【34】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【35】Amid Masters of Twentieth Century Medicine. Charles C Thomas , Springfield, Ill 1958\n\n【36】This group soon was augmented by Drs Stanley McVicar, Albert M. Snell, and Jay Bargen in gastroenterology; Dr Carl Greene in laboratory medicine; Dr Philip Hench in rheumatology; and Dr Bayard Horton in allergies.\n\n【37】Great things were expected of the Mayo Clinic after Rowntree made his appearance. Dr Russell Wilder believed that Rowntree's arrival at the clinic was the reason for William Osler's statement, made in 1919, that the Mayo's were wise men to make the clinic as important in medicine as it was in surgery.\n\n【38】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【39】Recollections and reflections on diabetes, other metabolic diseases and nutrition in the Mayo Clinic and affiliated hospitals, 1919-1950. Mayo Clinic Libraries , Rochester, Minn 1954\n\n【40】Rowntree's group formed a new section within the clinic, bringing the total number of medical sections to 8. Dr Henry Plummer, who retained the title of Chief of Medicine of the Mayo Clinic, headed the other 7 sections. Thus, during this period, the clinic had not 1, but 2 chiefs of medicine.\n\n【41】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【42】A History of the Department of Internal Medicine at the Mayo Clinic. Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research , Rochester, Minn 2002\n\n【43】In addition to his clinic responsibilities, Rowntree supervised 6 hospital services, all concentrating on research as well as patient care. “Each section of our department became productive almost immediately…. Almost overnight, everyone in the Clinic seemed to become interested in clinical investigation, and the output of publications shortly became enormous.”\n\n【44】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【45】Amid Masters of Twentieth Century Medicine. Charles C Thomas , Springfield, Ill 1958\n\n【46】Rowntree's research output was remarkable. During his 12 years at the clinic, he published more than 100 articles, primarily in the fields of endocrine disease, water metabolism, and hepatology, as well as 2 important monographs, _The Volume of the Blood and Plasma_ , written with G. E. Brown and G. M. Roth,\n\n【47】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【48】The Volume of the Blood and Plasma.

J. Mayo's convictions, the rule at the Mayo Clinic well into the second half of the 20th century was that the medical staff function as generalists first, regardless of their subspecialty interests. While they initially saw “all comers” in terms of patients, the various members of the Rowntree group (all with strong research interests) soon tended to narrow their investigative and therapeutic efforts. Wilder concentrated on diabetes; Keith on nephrology; Bargen, McVicar, and Snell on gastrointestinal diseases; and Brown on peripheral vascular diseases. Brown and Keith shared an interest in hypertension, with Brown focused on its early stages and Keith more interested in advanced hypertension and kidney diseases. Snell began to focus on liver and adrenal gland disease. Hench's main interest remained arthritis.\n\n【63】With the divergence of their various interests, the Rowntree group began to disperse. With time, the individual members affiliated more with other medical sections within the clinic, substantially enriching those sections and providing them with a much stronger research orientation. The result, at least in terms of the members’ research interests, led to the formation of new subspecialty groups.\n\n【64】Importantly, all of Rowntree's associates made noteworthy contributions to the medical knowledge of their day. Hench went on to win the Nobel Prize. They attracted the next generation of more research-minded clinicians to the Mayo Clinic and established the clinic in the minds of physicians throughout the world as a research institution.

Over the years, he spent less and less time caring for patients and instead devoted his energies to clinical investigation and the supervision of projects carried out by his fellows. Rowntree also spent much time in the late 1920s attending various national meetings and serving on committees. Apparently, Rowntree saw patients in the diagnostic sections of the clinic only by special request, and his hospital service was taken over gradually by Dr Snell.\n\n【77】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【78】Barker N.

Rowntree left the clinic in 1932.\n\n【80】Although the Depression undoubtedly played a role in this shutdown, strong personal factors also were involved.

J. Mayo upset simply because Rowntree wanted to leave? A letter written in September 1930 by Rowntree to Dr William Welch, his former advisor at Johns Hopkins, provides a clue as to why W. J. Mayo may have changed his attitude toward Rowntree\n\n【97】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【98】Letter to William H. Welch. Alan Mason Chesney Medical Archives.

By revealing structures too small to be seen by the unaided human eye, microscopes illuminate biology and disease in the same way that telescopes give insight into the large-scale structure of the universe. Because scientists and physicians use microscopes daily, familiarity can invite ennui. But in recent years, some artists and scientists have focused on the aesthetics of microscopic structures and the ways in which these instruments unveil the strange beauty of the hidden world.\n\n【1】The inventor of the microscope is unknown. Magnifying lenses appeared in the late medieval period in northern Italy at around the same time as eyeglasses. While compound microscopes with multiple lenses were already in use in Europe in the 1620s, including by astronomer and polymath Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), it was a simple one-lens microscope that Delft draper and lens making hobbyist, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1724), used to highlight the composition of blood, saliva, pond water, and other fluids. More than anyone else, it was van Leeuwenhoek whose observations awakened biologists in the 17 <sup>th </sup> century to the vast potential of microscopy. Scientists became so fascinated by microscopes that French astronomer, Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille (1713-1762), immortalized these instruments in his proposed astronomical constellation “Microscopium,” a small southern asterism that was one of 88 constellations formally recognized by the International Astronomical Union in 1930.\n\n【2】Since those promising early days, there have been many advances in microscopy equipment and techniques that have led to clearer and sharper images. The advent of achromatic lenses improved optics by decreasing chromatic and spherical aberration, while electron and x-ray microscopy allowed ultrastructural visualization. Mounting, lighting, and tissue staining techniques that debuted in the 19 <sup>th </sup> century dramatically improved the usefulness of microscopes in evaluating diseased tissues and understanding normal biology.\n\n【3】The microscope remains the workhorse of pathology departments and of biology laboratories around the globe, and it is also essential in numerous engineering and industrial applications. But how live images seen through an ocular are represented for others to view later has changed dramatically over time. In 1665, Robert Hooke (1635-1703), in England published _Micrographia; or, Some Physiological Descriptions of Minute Bodies Made by Magnifying Glasses._ Like van Leewenhoek and virtually all other microscopists for the first 2 centuries, Hooke rendered his observations as illustrations drawn in ink, subject to the impressions of the viewer **.**\n\n【4】Photography came along the 19 <sup>th </sup> century and made transmission of what was seen through the ocular much more objective. John Benjamin Dancer (1812-1887), an English instrument maker, made the first photomicrographs in 1839, employing the then-new imaging technique of daguerrotyping. That same year, William Henry Fox Talbot (1800-1877), used a technique he called “photographic drawing” to render insect wings and botanical specimens at 200-300x magnification. (Others, including Sir Humphrey Davy (1778-1829), the chemist who isolated potassium and sodium, may have made photomicrographs even earlier but left no convincing record.) In the 20 <sup>th </sup> century, museums and other institutions began to stage exhibitions of photomicrographs, for their aesthetic value as much as for their scientific interest. These images became much easier to create and manipulate as digital imagers became common in the late 20 <sup>th </sup> century and with the advent of inexpensive data storage and photo editing computer programs.\n\n【5】In December 2022, the United States Postal Service announced a new stamp issue focusing on beautiful and interesting microscopic images. “Life Magnified” will feature 20 brightly colored structures on a black background. Some of the chosen images were recent winners of the Nikon Small World Photomicrography competition, which has been celebrating light microscopy since 1975 . Other stamps recognize the contribution of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) enthusiasts, such as Steven Gschmeissner  and Dennis Kunkel , whose colorized SEM images are featured in the United Kingdom-based Science Photo Library.\n\n【6】Several of the stamps in this series depict structures in the human body, such as a stack of red blood cells arranged in a way that suggests pathological rouleaux. Another depiction is a knotted human hair, perhaps alluding to structural disorders of the hair such as Uncontrollable Hair Syndrome, which is due to germline mutations in the _PADI3_ , _TCHH,_ or _TGM_ gene. Other stamps depict microorganisms that can contribute to human disease, including mold spores, protozoans, and pollen. Animal structures that are paralleled in humans, like mouse neurons and starling bones, are also represented. And some images, like barnacle legs, diatoms, a snail tongue, and the antenna of a moth, are simply attractive and striking.\n\n【7】The collection was assembled by long-time USPS art director and graphic artist Derry Noyes , who has designed numerous postage stamps over the past 40 years and whose father, Eliot Noyes (1910-1977), was a graphic and industrial designer responsible for the famous IBM Selectric typewriter.\n\n【8】The stamp series is scheduled for release on August 10, 2023, with first day of issue ceremony planned during the Great American Stamp Show of the American Philatelic Society at the Huntington Convention Center in Cleveland, Ohio.

Data from consecutive patients with definite IE and possible left-sided IE were collected. Propensity score matching and adjustment for survivor bias were used to control for confounders. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 1019 patients with a mean age of 61 years (interquartile range, 47-71 years) were included. Early surgical treatment was performed in 417 episodes (40.9%). By propensity score, we matched 316 episodes: 158 who underwent early surgical treatment and 158 who did not (medical treatment group). In-hospital mortality and late mortality were lower in the surgically treated group (26.6% vs 41.8%; absolute risk reduction \\[ARR\\], −15.2%; _P_ \\=.004 and 29.7% vs 46.2%; ARR, −16.5%; _P_ \\=.002, respectively).

Her symptoms had started 2 days before transfer to our facility with a worsening daily headache. The headache was located in the right frontotemporal region and associated with nausea and vomiting. She described the headache as a continuous ache with intermittent throbbing but no associated aura, photophobia, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, or jaw pain. For several days before the onset of symptoms, she had intermittent fever with a maximum temperature of 39.0°C (reference range, 36.0°C-38.0°C), rigors, generalized malaise, light-headedness, and myalgias. She did not have diplopia, blurry vision, dysarthria, paresthesias, productive cough, wheezing, dyspnea, urinary urgency or frequency, dysuria, abdominal pain, loose stools, or any incontinence. A central line had not been placed at the outside facility.\n\n【1】The patient's medical history was notable for untreated hypertension, Bell palsy, and anemia. She was a native of the Ivory Coast and had traveled to Togo and Ghana before arriving in the United States to visit her son 3 months previously. She had no pets, did not consume undercooked meats, and did not take any medications.\n\n【2】On admission, vital signs were notable for a temperature of 37.6°C, a regular pulse rate of 86 beats/min, blood pressure of 152/89 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min, and normal oxygen saturation while breathing ambient air. Physical examination findings were notable for a mildly erythematous oropharynx and scleral icterus; there was no lymphadenopathy or neck stiffness, and Kernig and Brudzinski signs were absent. Laboratory studies yielded the following notable findings (reference ranges provided parenthetically): white blood cell count of 8.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (3.5-10.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) with a normal differentiation and platelet count of 83 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (150-450 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). The total bilirubin level was 1.3 mg/dL (≤1.2 mg/dL) with a conjugated fraction of 0.3 mg/dL (0.0-0.3 mg/dL). Results of an electrolyte panel and liver function studies were otherwise normal. The patient underwent chest radiography, which revealed no consolidations. Urinalysis results were normal. Testing for serum β-human chorionic gonadotropin was negative.\n\n【3】Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed a 6-mm left ophthalmic internal carotid artery aneurysm and a possible cavernous sinus meningioma on the right. On hospital day 2, the patient was scheduled for endovascular treament of the aneurysm, but the development of a fever (temperature, 39.4°C) prompted us to cancel the procedure.\n\n【4】*   1.\n\n【5】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ explanation for this patient's fever?**\n\n【6】    *   a.\n\n【7】        Lower respiratory tract infection\n\n【8】    *   b.\n\n【9】        Urinary tract infection\n\n【10】    *   c.\n\n【11】        Central line–associated infection\n\n【12】    *   d.\n\n【13】        Tropical illness\n\n【14】    *   e.\n\n【15】        Liver abscess\n\n【16】Lower respiratory tract infection is unlikely because the patient did not have respiratory symptoms and no abnormalities were noted on chest radiography. She had no signs and symptoms of a urinary tract infection and no history of central line placement. Because the patient is from West Africa, she is at risk of acquiring a tropical illness, which is the most likely diagnosis. Tropical illnesses encountered in West Africa include Ebola, typhoid or enteric fever, yellow fever, dengue fever, malaria, schistosomiasis, and chikungunya. In a patient with liver abscess, fever is typically accompanied by abdominal pain and elevated levels on liver function tests. The patient did not have this presentation.\n\n【17】Further infectious work-up including urine culture, throat culture, rapid _Streptococcus_ test, influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR), QuantiFERON-TB Gold tuberculosis test, and serologies for dengue virus, _Toxoplasma_ , _Cryptococcus_ antigen, _Histoplasma_ , _Coccidioides_ , and human immunodeficiency virus yielded negative results. Blood culture results were also negative. In the hospital, the patient's fever was treated with acetaminophen.\n\n【18】*   2.\n\n【19】    **At this time, which _one_ of the following is the _best_ next step?**\n\n【20】    *   a.\n\n【21】        PCR for Ebola\n\n【22】    *   b.\n\n【23】        Test for yellow fever–specific IgM\n\n【24】    *   c.\n\n【25】        Thick and thin blood smears for malaria\n\n【26】    *   d.\n\n【27】        Test for dengue-specific IgM\n\n【28】    *   e.\n\n【29】        Test for chikungunya-specific IgM\n\n【30】Ebola is included in the differential diagnosis given that the patient is from West Africa. Ebola is a viral illness spread from person to person via contact with contaminated blood or bodily fluids up to 21 days after exposure. Symptoms include fever, headache, myalgias, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and, in some cases, hemorrhage.\n\n【31】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【32】Our patient has been away from home for 3 months. To date, there have been no cases of Ebola in the Ivory Coast, although it shares a border with Guinea and Liberia where there has been an outbreak. Therefore, she is not likely to have Ebola and will not benefit from PCR testing of the blood. There have been outbreaks of yellow fever in the Ivory Coast, and because of this, yellow fever vaccine is recommended for travelers to this country. Illness begins 3 to 6 days after a bite from an infected mosquito. Symptoms include fever, myalgias, headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting. Following symptom remission, some patients have progression to a toxic phase that manifests with organ dysfunction and hemorrhage.\n\n【33】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【34】Malaria.\n\n【35】Our patient has been away from the endemic region for 90 days, much longer than the incubation period for yellow fever, and is unlikely to have this disease. Conversely, malaria can manifest months or even years after initial exposure, especially if one was previously exposed and developed partial immunity or received prophylaxis. Thick and thin blood smear for malaria is the criterion standard for diagnosis and is the most appropriate step at this time.\n\n【36】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【37】The thick film concentrates the parasites and increases diagnostic sensitivity. Nonimmune individuals may be symptomatic at very low parasite densities that initially may be undetectable by blood smear. In such cases, the smear should be repeated every 12 to 24 hours for 3 sets.\n\n【38】Dengue fever, also known as “break-bone fever,” is a mosquito-borne viral illness associated with urban environments and manifests with fever, severe headache with retro-orbital pain, and severe myalgias and arthralgias, The incubation period is several days.\n\n【39】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【40】Given that the patient has been out of the endemic area for a longer period of time, it is unlikely that she has dengue fever. Chikungunya is another mosquito-borne illness included in the differential diagnosis. Similar to dengue fever, it is associated with urban environments; the incubation period is a few days, and the illness is characterized by sudden onset of fever, rash, and severe joint pain.\n\n【41】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【42】Our patient is unlikely to have chikungunya because she has been out of the endemic area for longer than just a few days.\n\n【43】A blood parasite smear revealed parasitemia with 0.5% of cells infected with _Plasmodium_ that was confirmed by PCR as _Plasmodium falciparum_ .\n\n【44】*   3.\n\n【45】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _best_ treatment option for a patient who did not take malaria prophylaxis?**\n\n【46】    *   a.\n\n【47】        Chloroquine\n\n【48】    *   b.\n\n【49】        Atovaquone-proguanil\n\n【50】    *   c.\n\n【51】        Artesunate\n\n【52】    *   d.\n\n【53】        Intravenous quinidine gluconate plus doxycycline\n\n【54】    *   e.\n\n【55】        Exchange transfusion\n\n【56】The treatment choice depends on the malaria species, the clinical status of the patient, and the drug susceptibility of the infecting parasites as determined by the geographic area where the infection was acquired and the previous use of antimalarial medicines.\n\n【57】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【58】World Health Organization  \nGuidelines for the Treatment of Malaria.\n\n【59】2nd ed. World Health Organization , Geneva, Switzerland 2010\n\n【60】The initial decision is whether the patient has _P falciparum_ malaria or malaria due to _Plasmodium vivax_ , _Plasmodium ovale_ , _Plasmodium malariae_ , or _Plasmodium knowlesi_ . _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _P knowlesi_ infections can cause rapidly progressive severe illness or death, whereas the other species are less likely to have severe manifestations. Also, _P vivax_ and _P ovale_ infections require treatment for the hypnozoite forms that remain dormant in the liver and can cause relapsing infection.\n\n【61】Subsequent treatment decisions are based on classification of the disease as severe (ie, having end-organ damage) or uncomplicated. Uncomplicated disease is treated with oral antimalarial medications, and severe disease is treated with intravenous antimalarials. Our patient had no evidence of end-organ damage including impaired consciousness, hemoglobin level of less than 7 mg/dL, renal failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypotension, acidosis, and/or parasitemia with 5% or more of cells infected. The patient had uncomplicated _P falciparum_ malaria. Although she had headache, there was no suspicion for cerebral malaria, which is a manifestation of severe malaria presenting with end-organ damage including alteration in consciousness. Further, the choice of antimalarial is based on the origin of the disease, the susceptibility of the malaria species, and the adverse effects, availability, and cost of the medication.\n\n【62】In general, _P falciparum_ malaria acquired anywhere with the exception of the Caribbean, Central America west of the Panama Canal, and most of the Middle East is chloroquine resistant. Non– _P falciparum_ malaria is susceptible to chloroquine, but resistance is increasing in Indonesia, Oceania, and Peru. In this patient, _P falciparum_ malaria was acquired in West Africa. Chloroquine would not be a good choice because the organism would most likely be resistant to it. Atovaquone-proguanil is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated _P falciparum_ malaria in the United States and hence is the most appropriate treatment for this patient.\n\n【63】In most of the world, artemisinin combination therapies are first-line treatment for _P falciparum_ , but this is not the case in the United States because of low availability. For cases of severe malaria, intravenous artesunate should be used over intravenous quinine or quinidine because of markedly reduced parasitemia and risk of death when compared head-to-head.\n\n【64】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【65】Artesunate versus quinine for treating severe malaria.\n\n【66】In the United States, quinidine is used more often because it is more readily available than artemisinin derivatives. Doxycycline is used only in combination with artesunate or quinine as second-line therapy. The evidence for exchange blood transfusions in severe malaria is anecdotal, and no comparative trials have established efficacy.\n\n【67】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【68】Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Malaria. Clinical Guidance. Available at: cdc.gov/malaria/resources/pdf/clinicalguidance.pdf . Accessed September 9, 2015.\n\n【69】In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) performed an analysis of exchange transfusion as an adjunct to antimalarial drugs for treatment of severe malaria and concluded that it did not affect survival.\n\n【70】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【71】Exchange transfusion for severe malaria: evidence base and literature review.\n\n【72】As a result of this analysis, the CDC no longer recommends this treatment.\n\n【73】Our patient was treated with atovaquone-proguanil in the hospital. She tolerated the medication well. Her fever subsided, and her headache and nausea improved. The aneurysm was determined to be stable and did not require immediate intervention.\n\n【74】*   4.\n\n【75】    **Which _one_ of the following tests should be performed _next_ ?**\n\n【76】    *   a.\n\n【77】        Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) testing\n\n【78】    *   b.\n\n【79】        Hemoglobin electrophoresis\n\n【80】    *   c.\n\n【81】        Repeated thick and thin blood smear\n\n【82】    *   d.\n\n【83】        No additional testing\n\n【84】    *   e.\n\n【85】        PCR testing for drug resistance\n\n【86】Testing for G6PD is not indicated in this case because patients with G6PD deficiency experience hemolytic anemia from use of primaquine or fluoroquinolones,\n\n【87】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【88】G6PD Deficiency Working Group  \nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and antimalarial drug development.\n\n【89】which our patient has not received. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is helpful in diagnosing sickle cell disease or thalassemia, conditions that are protective against malaria. Thick and thin blood smear remains the criterion standard for diagnosing malaria, but there is no indication to repeat the smear once the diagnosis is established, especially in uncomplicated cases unless the patient has a relapse. In patients with severe malaria, the clinician may consider repeating daily smears to monitor progress with treatment. No additional testing is required for cases of malaria diagnosed outside the United States. The CDC recommends malaria testing including PCR for confirmation of species and identification of drug-resistant mutations because of the growing resistance to antimalarials and because most of the infections are acquired outside the United States. A PCR test is not done in most areas endemic for malaria because of the high cost and the requirement for a specialized laboratory. Rapid diagnostic tests using _Plasmodium_ antigens are also available for the diagnosis of malaria, but they are less sensitive in low parasitemia and may not be specific for the species. In that case, the smear is necessary for diagnosis.\n\n【90】The patient was discharged from the hospital with a 3-day regimen of atovaquone-proguanil. She followed up with a neurosurgeon for elective coiling of the aneurysm 1 week after completing treatment of the malaria. She remained afebrile and headache free. Following the neurosurgical procedure, she received dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin and clopidogrel. The patient planned to return home to the Ivory Coast.\n\n【91】*   5.\n\n【92】    **Which _one_ of the following is recommended to prevent malaria reinfection when the patient returns home to the Ivory Coast?**\n\n【93】    *   a.\n\n【94】        Chloroquine once weekly\n\n【95】    *   b.\n\n【96】        Atovaquone-proguanil once daily\n\n【97】    *   c.\n\n【98】        Bed nets, spraying the house with insecticide, draining stagnant water\n\n【99】    *   d.\n\n【100】        Vaccine\n\n【101】    *   e.\n\n【102】        Intermittent presumptive treatment\n\n【103】Chemoprophylaxis for malaria is recommended for travelers to an endemic area, including expatriates who lose their immunity to malaria after approximately 5 years. Chemoprophylaxis consists of chloroquine once weekly in chloroquine-sensitive areas or atovaquone-proguanil once daily when traveling to areas with chloroquine-resistant malaria. Chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for people living in endemic areas. Because our patient lives in the Ivory Coast, an endemic area, chemoprophylaxis is not recommended. Use of insecticide-impregnated bed nets, spraying the house with insecticide, draining stagnant water, using mosquito repellant on exposed skin and clothing, and avoiding the peak mosquito feeding period of dusk to dawn are measures to decrease mosquito bites and risk of infection with malaria. These measures are recommended for travelers as well as for natives of malaria-endemic regions, such as our patient. Another promising preventive therapy is a malaria vaccine, which is not currently available on the market but is in development.\n\n【104】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【105】RTS, S Clinical Trials Partnership  \nA phase 3 trial of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine in African infants.\n\n【106】Intermittent presumptive treatment can be used in high-risk populations (ie, pregnant women and infants) in endemic areas.\n\n【107】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【108】Infections in returning travelers.\n\n【109】Our patient is not in the high-risk group.\n\n【110】Discussion\n----------\n\n【111】Malaria is a major global health problem, with an estimated 207 million cases and 627,000 deaths worldwide in 2012. Malaria is endemic in more than 100 countries, and 3.4 billion individuals are at risk worldwide. Although malaria was eliminated from the United States in the early 1950s, approximately 1500 to 2000 cases of malaria are reported each year, almost exclusively in returned international travelers.\n\n【112】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【113】World Health Organization  \nWorld Malaria Report 2013.\n\n【114】World Health Organization , Geneva, Switzerland 2013\n\n【115】Malaria is transmitted by the female _Anopheles_ mosquito, and infection in humans is caused by 5 protozoan species of the genus _Plasmodium_ — _P falciparum_ , _P vivax_ , _P ovale_ , _P malariae_ , and _P knowlesi_ . Most cases reported in the United States are caused by _P falciparum_ (58%) or _P vivax_ (17%).\n\n【116】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【117】Malaria should be part of the differential diagnosis for all patients who present with fever within 1 year after international travel to an endemic area, even if the patient has had previous exposure and developed partial immunity or has received prophylaxis. More than 90% of cases occur within 30 days of exposure.\n\n【118】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【119】Malaria surveillance—United States, 2012.\n\n【120】The differential diagnosis for fever in a returned traveler also includes infections common in nontravelers (urinary tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, community-acquired pneumonia) as well as typhoidal and nontyphoidal salmonellosis, dengue fever, viral hepatitis, and rickettsial infections. Nearly 95% of patients with malaria in the United States report a history of fever, but only half have a fever the day of presentation. Malaria presents with a “cold” stage in which a patient shakes with rigors, followed by a “hot” stage in which the temperature can exceed 40°C, after which the patient sweats and the temperature returns to normal.\n\n【121】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【122】Malaria.\n\n【123】Although the fever is traditionally described as occurring in discrete episodes lasting a few hours every 2 to 3 days, the fever can have an irregular pattern throughout the day. Additional symptoms are generally nonspecific and can include headache, malaise, and myalgias. Patients may also report gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea or nausea. The most common physical examination abnormality aside from fever is splenomegaly.\n\n【124】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【125】Malaria.\n\n【126】Laboratory abnormalities are generally mild and may include transaminitis, hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and/or thrombocytopenia. Patients with _P falciparum_ malaria may decompensate rapidly, and infection with this species is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment, particularly in nonimmune travelers. Complications may include impaired consciousness or coma, seizure, respiratory distress, severe anemia, renal failure, jaundice, or disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n\n【127】The criterion standard for diagnosis of malaria is microscopic identification of malaria parasites on Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears. If the initial smear results are negative and malaria is suspected, blood smears should be repeated at 12- to 24-hour intervals for 48 to 72 hours. Other methods of diagnosis include rapid tests and PCR. Patients with malaria should be treated immediately. If a patient's presentation is strongly suggestive of severe malaria and there is a compatible travel history, diagnostic testing should not delay treatment. The optimal treatment regimen varies depending on several factors, including severity, the species of malaria, the likelihood of drug resistance (based on where the infection was acquired), patient age, and pregnancy status. Oral treatment options for uncomplicated malaria include chloroquine (in sensitive areas), atovaquone-proguanil, or artemisinin combinations. Severe malaria—characterized by end-organ damage, hemoglobin level less than 7 mg/dL, parasitemia (>5% infected cells), or acidosis—is treated with intravenous artesunate or quinidine. Pregnant women are treated with mefloquine or quinidine and clindamycin for uncomplicated malaria. Detailed treatment guidelines and recommendations are available on the CDC website.\n\n【128】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【129】Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Malaria treatment table.

Unadjusted and adjusted Cox regression analyses were performed to assess heart rate as a prognostic marker, both as a continuous variable and after categorization into quintiles. Smooth spline estimates and hazard ratios (HRs) were plotted for 2 age strata (<75 years vs ≥75 years) for each individual heart rate.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 1033 patients were included (766 men \\[74.2%\\]; mean age, 65.1±12.6 years). During a mean follow-up of 4.6±3.3 years (median, 3.8 years \\[25th-75th percentile, 1.9-6.9\\]), 476 patients (46.1%) died. Mortality was associated with a statistically greater heart rate in the total cohort (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.26; _P_ <.001). From a clinical viewpoint, this means an 18% increased risk for every 10-beats/min elevation in heart rate. The same characteristics were present in the relationship between heart rate assessed after 6 months and long-term mortality (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.20-1.42; _P_ <.001). Overall, the prognostic importance of heart rate in ambulatory patients with HF was largely influenced by patient age. Remarkably, in the elderly population (≥75 years), heart rate below 68 beats/min conferred an increased risk of death, whereas in younger patients, mortality exhibited a declining slope at even the lowest heart rates.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Our research, if applicable to the prospective management of patients with ambulatory HF, suggests that patients aged 75 years or older have the best outcomes with target heart rates of 68 beats/min; however, younger patients may benefit from lower heart rates, even below 55 beats/min.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ECG ( electrocardiography ), HF ( heart failure ), HR ( hazard ratio ), LVEF ( left ventricular ejection fraction ), Q1-Q3 ( 25th-75th percentile ), SR ( sinus rhythm )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Even before COVID-19, a physician shortage has been an ongoing issue in the United States. The Association of American Medical Colleges predicted that there will be a shortage of 46,900 to 121,900 physicians by 2032.\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】Association of American Medical Colleges  \n2019 Update: The Complexities of Physician Supply and Demand: Projections from 2017 to 2032.\n\n【3】Association of American Colleges , Washington, DC 2019\n\n【4】With the onset of the pandemic, the medical community is in an “all-hands-on-deck” situation where physicians and other health care workers, regardless of specialization, are taking care of patients with COVID-19. While health care professionals are at the frontlines in hospitals, clinics, and emergency rooms, scientists from across the country are engaged in multifaceted research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and COVID-19 to understand its epidemiology and pathophysiology, and to develop high-throughput diagnostic tools, novel therapeutics, and vaccines to mitigate the disease. The US biomedical workforce that is at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19 is significantly reliant on its international members.\n\n【5】We define the international biomedical workforce as the non-citizen physicians, physicians-in-training, and researchers on immigrant and temporary non-immigrant visas in the United States. Foreign-born physicians and surgeons accounted for approximately 28% of the physician workforce in 2018.\n\n【6】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【7】United States Census Bureau.\n\n【8】Among resident physicians-in-training, almost 15% were not US citizens or permanent residents.\n\n【9】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【10】Graduate medical education, 2018–2019.\n\n【11】Additionally, more than 33,000 individuals were sponsored by the US Department of State’s Exchange Visitor Program in 2019 to train and work in the United States on temporary research visas.\n\n【12】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【13】Exchange Visitor Program.

While the exemption of international physicians and scientists from the ban is reassuring, there remains significant concern and anxiety within the medical community. Individuals may be at different stages in the visa/immigration process, and it is uncertain who among the members of the international medical and scientific community would be impacted by the evolving situation. Moreover, the provision states that it exempts those who “perform medical research or other research intended to combat the spread of COVID-19,” leaving unclear how this will affect the research community not directly engaged in studying COVID-19. Significant disruptions in the research workforce can have important and devastating repercussions to all scientific progress, COVID-19 included. After all, the US research infrastructure, as in many countries, is intertwined and spans multiple disciplines. More importantly, COVID-19 is not a disease that evolves in isolation; its repercussions extend to the delivery of care for other diseases and conditions, which equally warrant comprehensive and multidisciplinary efforts from the biomedical community.\n\n【24】With respect to international physicians and researchers seeking to train in the United States, applying for visas is a complex, multi-step process, and is dependent on the efforts of sponsors, institutions, and governments. For physicians-in-training, especially, there is significant back-and-forth of documents among the visa applicant’s home institution, training institution, state licensing board, and the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, such that timely processing and release of documents is vital. J-1 alien physician visa applicants must also secure a Statement of Need from their home governments, and the level of difficulty to obtain this document varies among countries. Once the approval is obtained by the US State Department and the documents received by the applicant, only then can one schedule an interview in the US embassy or consulate. Each step of this process for our colleagues on J-1 or H1-B visas has the potential to be negatively affected by indefinite community lockdowns, staffing disruptions, and delays in courier services as results of the pandemic. Thus, the precarious situations of our upcoming international physician workforce may cause disruptions to the frontline efforts to combat COVID-19.\n\n【25】International physicians and researchers who are actively working in the United States also face uncertainties. Visa extensions, visa renewals, and permanent resident applications are step-wise complex processes that adhere to specific timelines. Hiring freezes for researchers are also occurring in some institutions. Moreover, a significant proportion of the international physician workforce is transitioning from training to practice, an exceedingly complicated process. This includes switching from one visa status to another or to permanent residency to maintain legal status in the United States, both of which are likely affected by the strain of the pandemic on government agencies. It is unclear if the evolving immigration policies would negatively impact individuals in this transition.\n\n【26】In this critical time, international physicians and researchers rely heavily on the support of their sponsoring institutions and advocacies from various organizations. In response to this evolving situation, the National Resident Matching Program continues to monitor the situation and aims to work with individuals whose visa processing and travel into the United States may be stalled. With the suspension of routine visa processing in US embassies worldwide, the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates advocated for international physicians to the US State Department, ultimately resuming visa processing for physicians matched to training programs in the United States. Some stringent documentation requirements have also been relaxed.\n\n【27】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【28】COVID-19 Impacts on IMGs and Their Contributions to U.S. Health Care.\n\n【29】The Association of American Medical Colleges released a letter to several members of Congress to “maintain the US health and research workforce by extending visas, streamlining approval of new visas and change of status, providing flexibility to sponsors in deploying visa holders where they are needed, expanding Conrad-30, and maintaining work authorization for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) recipients.”\n\n【30】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【31】AAMC Letter to VP, Congress, Highlighting Further Recommendations to Address COVID-19 Impact on Academic Medicine.\n\n【32】We strongly encourage societies of various medical specialties to advocate for international physicians and researchers who are all contributing significantly to address this public health emergency.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【34】The rippling effects of the COVID-19 pandemic extend beyond their devastating health and socio-economic impacts. Consequent effects on evolving travel restrictions, visa sponsorships, and immigration policies can potentially add more strain to the already overburdened biomedical workforce. Since the current complexity of the immigration process is now superimposed upon a global pandemic, it is of utmost importance to ensure our international biomedical workforce is preserved.

RNA is of central importance in the synthesis of protein by cells. Ochoa discovered an enzyme in bacteria that enabled him to synthesize RNA. The enzyme he named _polynucleotide phosphorylase_ has enabled scientists to understand and to re-create the process whereby the hereditary information contained in genes is translated through RNA intermediaries into enzymes that determine the function and character of each cell.\n\n【1】Ochoa, the youngest son of a lawyer and businessman, was born on September 24, 1905, in Luarca on the Bay of Biscay in northern Spain. He received his early education in Luarca and went to Málaga (on the southern coast) for his college education. He graduated from Málaga College in 1921 and entered the University of Madrid to study medicine, where the famous professor of histology and pathologic anatomy Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852-1934) taught and worked. Ochoa received his medical degree from the university in 1929. He spent the next 2 years studying the biochemistry and physiology of muscle tissue as a research assistant to the famous German physiologist Otto Meyerhof (1884-1951) at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes in Berlin (1929-1930) and Heidelberg (1930-1931).\n\n【2】In 1931, Ochoa returned to the University of Madrid as a lecturer in physiology and biochemistry. In 1932, he went to London, England, to work at the Normal Institute for Medical Research, where he concentrated on enzymology. He returned to Madrid to become head of the physiology division at the Institute for Medical Research at the university, where he remained until 1936.\n\n【3】When the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, Ochoa went to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Germany. In 1937, he went to England to work at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Plymouth. In 1938, he became a demonstrator and research assistant at Oxford University and worked in the medical school there until 1940. While at Oxford, Ochoa investigated the function of thiamine (vitamin B <sub>1 </sub> ) in the body.\n\n【4】Ochoa came to the United States in 1941. He worked at Washington University in St Louis, Mo, for 1 year, and was subsequently appointed to the faculty of New York University (NYU) in New York City. He became a professor of pharmacology and chair of the department at NYU in 1946. In 1954, Ochoa became professor and chair of biochemistry. He remained at NYU until he retired in 1974. After he retired from NYU, he joined Roche Institute of Molecular Biology in New Jersey. He became a naturalized American citizen in 1956.\n\n【5】Until 1950, Ochoa worked primarily on enzyme-catalyzed reactions of carbohydrates and fatty acid metabolism involved in various energy-yielding activities of the cell. In the early 1950s, he turned his attention to the study of photosynthesis, and in 1955, he reported the first synthesis of a nucleic acid in a test tube. Ochoa contributed substantially to the development of the field of biochemistry, especially to the understanding of the structure and mechanics of enzyme action.\n\n【6】Besides receiving the Nobel Prize, Ochoa was given many honors and was awarded numerous honorary degrees. He died on November 1, 1993, in Madrid, at the age of 88 years.

Overall, it provides a practical guide for clinicians that is based on the 2018 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology/Multisociety Guideline on the Management of Blood Cholesterol (2018 Guideline) but provides further guidance on incorporation of coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores to more accurately determine ASCVD risk for individual patients. Although guidelines are valuable, patient care should be individualized, and incorporating CAC for individualized risk stratification can be very valuable.\n\n【5】Although the article overall is very well written, the section on how to manage patients with CAC between 1 and 99 scores could be further elucidated. For patients with CAC scores of zero and those with CAC scores >100, there is fairly universal agreement on management (without statin and with statin therapy, respectively); however, the middle group of patients with CAC 1 to 99 scores is the quandary. As written, the article simply leaves patients in this group to clinician–patient discussion but without details on how to guide this discussion. I suggest taking the authors’ algorithm one step further.\n\n【6】The CAC score can be used as an input for a revised or individualized 10-year ASCVD risk estimate, most notably by using The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) calculator.\n\n【7】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【8】MESA The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atheroscleriosis website.\n\n【9】Similar to the rest of the authors’ algorithm, by incorporating the CAC score into the MESA calculator, clinicians can determine a risk score that is individualized for each patient. Clinicians can use this revised and more accurate risk estimate in a similar manner to the pooled cohort calculator from the 2018 Guideline (eg, recommend statin if 10-year risk of ASCVD is >7.5%, suggest only therapeutic lifestyle changes if risk is <5%, with an acknowledgment that there is some benefit to statins, but the benefit is sufficiently small that treatment can be deferred). The management of patients who have revised 10-year risks between 5% and 7.5%, unfortunately, remains unclear, and this should be left to clinician–patient discussion, as originally stated in the article. But at least for patients with revised risk estimates <5% or >7.5%, the guidance for clinicians and to patients can be clearer. And even for the patients with risks between 5% and 7.5%, there is at least a quantifiable risk that can be used as part of shared decision making rather than simply using the CAC score, which is too abstract to help patients understand their conditions.\n\n【10】I express my gratitude to the authors and editors for their contribution to the medical literature, and I hope they find my additional personalization of the proposed algorithm as proper and valuable.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The goal of inhaled antibiotics is to provide maximal concentrations at the site of infection without risking systemic toxicity. We report an unusual case of reversible vestibular toxicity due to inhaled tobramycin in a patient with renal failure who was undergoing hemodialysis. Although systemic absorption after inhaled tobramycin is reportedly negligible, no recommendations have been published regarding monitoring of serum concentrations in patients receiving this form of therapy. We suggest that clinicians consider monitoring serum concentrations of tobramycin in patients at risk of renal toxicity and/or ototoxicity, such as those with predisposing renal or otologic compromise. Further studies in at-risk patients are needed to determine the optimal frequency and timing of such monitoring.\n\n【1】Inhaled tobramycin was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1997 for the treatment of pulmonary infections caused by _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ in patients with cystic fibrosis.

None of the 252 patients studied experienced renal or eighth nerve toxicity, although 8 patients reported transient tinnitus in the absence of hearing loss; the drug was not discontinued in any of these patients. Patients with compromised renal function (defined as a serum creatinine level of =2 mg/dL) were excluded from these studies. We report a patient with renal insufficiency in whom inhaled tobramycin caused overt vestibular toxicity.\n\n【5】REPORT OF A CASE\n----------------\n\n【6】A 41-year-old woman who was undergoing hemodialysis for chronic renal failure due to Wegener granulomatosis experienced bronchiectasis with chronic _P aeruginosa_ colonization that was complicated by frequent episodes of symptomatic bronchopneumonia. Repeated courses of parenteral antimicrobial therapy and hospitalization were required. At evaluation on May 11, 1999, the patient was afebrile. Physical examination disclosed crackles at the right lung base but no other abnormal findings. Laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 4.6 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and a serum creatinine level of 9.2 mg/dL; sputum culture yielded a heavy growth of _P aeruginosa_ . Chest radiography showed scarring in the right lung base, and computed tomography revealed bronchiectasis.\n\n【7】In an attempt to reduce the density of _P aeruginosa_ in the sputum, the patient was treated with inhaled tobramycin, 300 mg twice daily, beginning on May 12, 1999. On May 28, the serum tobramycin level was 19.2 mg/L, and on June 5, it was 19.5 mg/L. On both occasions, tobramycin levels were obtained before hemodialysis. Because of the considerably elevated serum concentrations, inhaled tobramycin was discontinued, and the predialysis serum concentration decreased to 9.8 mg/L 2 days later. One week after use of tobramycin had been discontinued, the patient experienced dizziness, ataxia, and oscillopsia.\n\n【8】The patient was initially referred for auditory and vestibular testing on July 2, 1999, and underwent follow-up assessments on August 21, 2002, and March 11, 2003. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory\n\n【9】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【10】The development of the Dizziness Handicap Inventory.\n\n【11】was administered to determine the patient's level of handicap. This inventory consists of 25 questions that address the physical, emotional, and functional components of a patient's complaints. Seven questions focus on physical aspects (eg, “Does bending over increase your problem?”), 9 address emotional issues (eg, “Because of your problem, do you feel handicapped?”), and 9 relate to functional limitations (eg, “Because of your problem, is it difficult for you to go for a walk by yourself?”). Each question has a score of 0, 2, or 4 for answers of “No,” “Sometimes,” and “Yes,” respectively. Higher scores indicate greater handicap. In 1999, our patient's total score was 72, which is extremely high and indicates major difficulty. Four years later, her score was 26, a marked decrease in perceived handicap, but she continued to experience some disability . In 1999, vestibular rehabilitation was recommended, but in 2003, the patient reported that she had not undergone therapy because her insurance provider did not cover the cost.\n\n【12】TABLE 1 Results of Dizziness Handicap Inventory in a Patient With Inhaled Tobramycin–Associated Vestibular Toxicity\n\n【13】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【14】See text for explanation of scoring.\n\n|  | Component Scores |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Physical | Emotional | Functional | Total score |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| July 1999 | 26/28 | 20/36 | 26/36 | 72/100 |\n| March 2003 | 8/28 | 10/36 | 8/36 | 26/100 |\n| Improvement (points) | 18 | 10 | 18 | 46 |\n\n【16】\\* See text for explanation of scoring.\n\n【17】Pure-tone air-conduction thresholds were measured in 1999 and 2002.

Nystagmus indicated a bias difference between the 2 ears, with the patient in the sitting, supine, head-right, head-left, head-hanging, and 30° supine position . Right-beating nystagmus was noted in 5 of 6 head positions tested in 1999. In 2002, the patient had nystagmus in only 3 of the 6 head positions. Although these findings were considered nonlocalizing, they showed a reduction in the bias difference between the ears and highlight the importance of monitoring positional nystagmus to document changes that have occurred over time.\n\n【23】TABLE 2 Results of Positional Testing With Eyes Closed and Mental Alerting in Patient With Inhaled Tobramycin–Associated Vestibular Toxicity\n\n【24】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【25】LB = left-beating; RB = right-beating.\n\n|  | Position-induced nystagmus (degrees per second) |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Sitting | Supine | Head right | Head left | Head hanging | 30° supine |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| July 1999 | 2 RB | 3 RB | None | 3 RB | 5 RB | 4 RB |\n| August 2002 | None | None | 3 LB | 4 RB | None | 4 LB |\n\n【27】\\* LB = left-beating; RB = right-beating.\n\n【28】Bithermal binaural caloric testing, the gold standard for assessing any difference in strength between the ears as well as the overall strength of the responses, was performed in 1999 and 2002 . In 1999, total absolute responses to warm and cool irrigations of the right and left ear were 20° per second and 24° per second, respectively, for a total of 44° per second in both ears .\n\n【29】FIGURE 3 Top, Alternating bithermal binaural caloric testing in July 1999 revealed peak slow-phase velocities (SPV) of 7, -13, -12, and 12 for right cool, right warm, left cool, and left warm, respectively. Bottom, Testing in August 2002 revealed SPV of 12, -21, -11, and 21 for right cool, right warm, left cool, and left warm, respectively. (Note scale difference between top \\[0-20° per second\\] and bottom \\[0-40° per second\\].) Boxes represent a 10-second window used to calculate peak SPV. Deg/sec = degrees per second.\n\n【30】Testing revealed right unilateral weakness of 9% (abnormal, >20%) and 14% right-beating directional preponderance (abnormal, >30%). Total output for the 4 irrigations was 44° per second (abnormal, <30° per second). Thus, the patient had normal, robust responses. However, even stronger responses were noted in August 2002: 33° per second in the right ear, 32° per second in the left ear, and a total of 65° per second for both ears .\n\n【31】There was 2% left peripheral weakness and 2% left-beating directional preponderance. Thus, an overall increase of 21° per second (from 44° to 65° per second) occurred from 1999 to 2002.\n\n【32】Computerized dynamic posturographic assessment of motor control yielded normal results in both 1999 and 2002. However, findings on sensory organization testing were substantially different. In 1999, the patient had abnormal results on 7 of 11 test trials for conditions 1 through 4 . Conditions 5 and 6, which require good vestibular input, produced falls on all 6 test trials. This resulted in an abnormal composite score of 44 (70 is normal for the patient's age). In 2002, the scores had improved considerably, with abnormal results on only 1 of 12 trials for conditions 1 through 4 and only 2 falls on 6 trials for conditions 5 and 6 . However, the composite score was still slightly abnormal at 64.\n\n【33】FIGURE 4 Sensory organization testing in July 1999 (top) and August 2002 (bottom).

Aminoglycosides can be toxic to the hearing and balance systems.\n\n【36】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【37】Lerner SA Matz GJ Hawkins Jr, JE Aminoglycoside Ototoxicity.

Several studies of the use of aerosolized tobramycin in humans with normal renal function have monitored serum concentrations and found them to be consistently lower than 1 mg/L and often undetectable.\n\n【41】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【42】Quantitative deposition of aerosolized gentamicin in cystic fibrosis.\n\n【43】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【44】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【45】Lung distribution and pharmacokinetics of aerosolized tobramycin.\n\n【46】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【47】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【48】Efficacy of aerosolized tobramycin in patients with cystic fibrosis.\n\n【49】Various doses were used in these studies with no ototoxicity or nephrotoxicity reported.\n\n【50】Although use of inhaled tobramycin has been approved for patients with cystic fibrosis and most of the reported clinical experience has been with these patients, recent reports suggest an expanding role for aerosolized aminoglycoside therapy. In a multicenter study, Barker et al\n\n【51】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【52】Tobramycin solution for inhalation reduces sputum _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ density in bronchiectasis.\n\n【53】studied the efficacy and safety of inhaled tobramycin (300 mg twice daily via jet nebulizer for 4 weeks) in 74 adult patients with bronchiectasis who had a sputum density of _P aeruginosa_ of 10 <sup>4 </sup> colony-forming units per gram. Compared with patients receiving placebo, tobramycin recipients experienced subjective clinical improvement and had significant reduction in the density of _P aeruginosa_ in sputum. The median serum concentration of tobramycin was 0.54 mg/L, and no renal or eighth nerve toxicity was reported. However, adverse events affecting the respiratory tract-dyspnea, chest pain, and wheezing-were noted in many of the tobramycin recipients, and a posttreatment 4-fold increase in the tobramycin minimal inhibitory concentration was found in 26% of patients.\n\n【54】Sacks et al\n\n【55】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【56】Adjunctive salvage therapy with inhaled aminoglycosides for patients with persistent smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis.\n\n【57】recently described the use of adjunctive inhaled aminoglycosides in 19 patients with persistently smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. Among the patients with drug-susceptible tuberculosis who were treated with aerosolized gentamicin, sputum conversion was rapid, and no adverse effects were noted. The authors did not report serum concentrations of aminoglycosides.\n\n【58】To our knowledge, our patient, who was undergoing long-term hemodialysis, represents the first reported case of sustained vestibular toxicity in association with inhaled aminoglycoside therapy. Kahler et al\n\n【59】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【60】Toxic serum trough concentrations after administration of nebulized tobramycin.\n\n【61】recently reported elevated trough serum concentrations (>2 mg/L) in a patient with renal failure who was receiving inhaled tobramycin; unlike our patient, this patient had no clinical evidence of ototoxicity.

After treatment, she had serious subjective complaints of dizziness on the basis of her Dizziness Handicap Inventory results. Three years later, her condition had improved markedly, but some vestibular deficit persisted. If the patient had been able to undergo vestibular rehabilitation (not covered by her insurance provider), even greater improvement might have been achieved. Her hearing test in 1999 showed a mild hearing loss that resolved by 2002. Objectively, she had abnormal positional nystagmus in 1999 that improved by 2002. Her caloric responses, although normal in 1999 and 2002, were stronger in 2002. Her balance, as measured on posturography after the acute attack, was grossly abnormal, but it improved markedly during the next 3 years.\n\n【65】TABLE 3 Vestibular Test Data From a Patient With Inhaled Tobramycin–Associated Toxicity\n\n【66】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【67】ND = not done; SOT = sensory organization test .\n\n| Study | July 1999 | August 2002 | March 2003 |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Dizziness Handicap Inventory | 72/100 (highly abnormal) | ND | 26/100 (greatly improved) |\n| Air-conduction threshold testing | Mild loss at 6 and 8 kHz | Within reference range | ND |\n| Oculomotor testing (smooth pursuit) | Within reference range, but cogwheeling evident at high frequencies | Normal, no cogwheeling | ND |\n| Saccadic eye movement test | Normal velocity, accuracy, and latency | Normal velocity, accuracy, and latency | ND |\n| Positional testing with eyes closed | Nystagmus in 5 of 6 head positions | Nystagmus in 3 of 6 head positions | ND |\n| Caloric test | Within reference range | Within reference range, but stronger response | ND |\n| Computerized posturography (motor control) | Normal | Normal | ND |\n| Sensory organization test | Abnormal, with all falls on SOT conditions 5 and 6 | SOT results improved dramatically | ND |\n\n【69】\\* ND = not done; SOT = sensory organization test .\n\n【70】Guidelines for monitoring serum concentrations in patients treated with inhaled aminoglycosides have not been published, and this route of administration can, in certain clinical circumstances, result in elevated serum levels and associated clinical toxicity.

Mean ± SD CSF protein level was 52.2±18.4 mg/dL (to convert to mg/L, multiply by 10), with a 95% reference interval of 24.0 to 93.4 mg/dL (range, 14.0-148.0 mg/dL). Spinal stenosis and arterial hypertension were associated with higher CSF protein levels on univariable analysis ( _P_ <.001). Increasing age, male sex, and diabetes were all independently associated with higher CSF protein levels on multivariable analysis ( _P_ <.001). In the 66 participants with repeated LPs within 2.5 years, the coefficient of repeatability was 26.1 mg/dL. Eleven participants (16.7%) had a CSF protein level difference of 20 mg/dL or more between serial LPs, and 4 (6.1%) had a difference of 25 mg/dL or more. There was a trend toward greater CSF protein level variability in patients with spinal stenosis ( _P_ \\=.054).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】This large population-based study showed that CSF protein level can vary significantly among individuals. Elevated CSF protein level was independently associated with older age, male sex, and diabetes and is higher than listed in many laboratories. These findings emphasize the necessity of evidence-based reevaluation and standardization of CSF protein metrics.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BMI ( body mass index ), CSF ( cerebrospinal fluid ), LP ( lumbar puncture ), MCSA ( Mayo Clinic Study of Aging )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Patients with these clinical characteristics may benefit from discharge to progressive or intensive care units in the early postoperative period.\n\n【9】Emergency response teams (ERTs) have been introduced by hospitals to evaluate and manage hospitalized patients whose condition is acutely deteriorating. Patients assessed as clinically stable and able to be managed on regular wards (ie, standard nursing wards) may experience acute deterioration,\n\n【10】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【11】Pre-arrest morbidity and other correlates of survival after in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\n【12】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【13】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【14】Clinical antecedents to in-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\n【15】and the ERT is designed to promptly deliver care to these patients.

Because we were primarily interested in perioperative factors, our study was limited to ERTs activated within the first 48 postoperative hours. Identification of factors associated with increased risk for these events may help to better triage patients and minimize adverse postoperative outcomes.\n\n【30】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【31】The approval for review of medical records was obtained from the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board in Rochester, MN. This study employed a retrospective case-control design that assessed potential factors associated with the need for an ERT activation after either surgery or diagnostic procedures that required anesthesia.\n\n【32】The Department of Anesthesiology at Mayo Clinic prospectively maintains a log of all ERT activations that occur at 2 Mayo Clinic-affiliated hospitals in Rochester: Saint Marys and Methodist. Using this log, we identified adult patients who required ERT activation within 48 hours of discharge from the PACU to regular wards from June 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009. (Regular ward refers to a standard nursing ward where patient vital signs are assessed at protocol-defined intervals as well as when clinically indicated. Care may include continuous pulse oximetry but not invasive monitoring as in an ICU or progressive care unit setting.) By June 1, 2008, the ERT activation log system had been fully implemented and was capturing 100% of events. The 48-hour time window was selected to allow identification of factors directly related to the intraoperative course. Surgical patients discharged to monitored wards were excluded. ( _Monitored ward_ is defined as an advanced patient care ward where patient vital signs are continually monitored as in an ICU or other specialized patient care areas where continual monitoring is indicated, eg, progressive care unit.) Patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, bronchoscopy, or childbirth were excluded. For each patient who required ERT activation, we used the Mayo Clinic medical record database to identify potential controls of the same sex and similar age (±10 years) who underwent the same procedure (as determined from _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision_ procedure codes) during the study period and did not have ERT activation in the first 48 postoperative hours. From these pools of potential controls, we randomly selected up to 2 controls for each ERT patient. For cases in which fewer than 2 potential controls could be identified, we did not select alternative controls.\n\n【33】### Indications for ERT Activations\n\n【34】At our institution an ERT consists of either a rapid response team (RRT) or code team. An RRT call can be initiated by any health care team member concerned about the acutely deteriorating medical condition of a patient. Typically at our institution, RRT calls are prompted as described by others,\n\n【35】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【36】Prospective controlled trial of effect of medical emergency team on postoperative morbidity and mortality rates.\n\n【37】and indications include the following: decline in oxyhemoglobin saturation (assessed by either pulse oximetry or clinical assessment), bradypnea, tachypnea, profound bradycardia or tachycardia, hypotension, concern for possible heart attack (“chest pain”), stroke (acute neurologic deficits), or acute mental status changes (agitation, delirium). However, an RRT call can be initiated for any other indication at the discretion of the health care team member. The RRT consists of an attending physician board-certified in critical care medicine, a critical care fellow or senior anesthesia resident, a respiratory therapist, and a critical care registered nurse. Code team activations are reserved for immediate life-threatening events (cardiopulmonary arrest, severe respiratory compromise that is assessed to require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation) or profoundly unstable cardiac conditions (possibly requiring cardioversion, defibrillation). The code team is similar in structure to the RRT but consists of an additional critical care registered nurse, an internal medicine resident, and a pharmacist. The level of ERT (RRT or code team) activation is left to the discretion of the individual health care team member (ie, nurse caring for an unstable patient); thus it is prone to subjectivity. Therefore, the level of activation occasionally is erroneous (making a “mistake on the safe side” by activating the code team when the RRT would have been more appropriate). Regardless, the roles and capabilities of these 2 teams are closely interrelated. Because our interest was to examine patients who had an acute postoperative deterioration, we analyzed all ERT interventions, regardless of the level of activation.\n\n【38】### Data Abstraction\n\n【39】Electronic medical records were abstracted for demographics; comorbid conditions; preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables; postoperative course and complications; and details of the ERT activation. Comorbid conditions were defined according to definitions used for numerous outcome studies at Mayo Clinic,\n\n【40】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【41】Outcomes of surgery in patients 90 years of age and older.\n\n【42】including cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease \\[myocardial infarction, coronary stent placement, or cardiac bypass surgery\\], congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathy \\[ejection fraction <40%\\], the potential for cardiac dysrhythmia \\[atrial fibrillation or flutter, implanted pacemaker and/or automated defibrillator\\], arterial hypertension \\[medically treated\\], peripheral vascular disease), central neurologic disease (history of seizures, dementia, stroke, or transient ischemic attacks), pulmonary disease (asthma, chronic obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea), diabetes mellitus (medically treated), kidney disease, and preoperative scheduled use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines. Overall physical status was assessed from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status score.\n\n【43】The anesthetic record was reviewed for anesthesia duration, anesthetic method (general, regional), urgency (elective, emergent), muscle relaxant use, blood transfusion, fluid administration, and perioperative complications. Complications included hemodynamic instability or systemic arterial hypotension (inferred by use of vasopressor infusion as a surrogate for recalcitrant hypotension), need for cardioversion, adverse respiratory events, or other severe perioperative complication.\n\n【44】All data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Mayo Clinic.\n\n【45】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【46】Research electronic data capture (REDCap)–a metadata-driven methodology and workflow process for providing translational research informatics support.\n\n【47】ERT notes were abstracted and supplemented by review of the medication administration record, ICU admission note, subsequent progress notes, and discharge summaries. Data abstracted included the probable primary cause of the ERT activation: hypotension from hypovolemia or distributive shock, respiratory cause, cardiac cause, hypertensive crisis, neurologic causes such as mental status changes, uncontrolled pain, psychiatric reasons, or drug reactions. The following interventions were recorded: respiratory (tracheal intubation, application of a noninvasive ventilatory device such as a continuous positive airway pressure device, bronchodilator administration), cardiac (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation or cardioversion, administration of vasoactive drugs, nitroglycerin, antiarrhythmic drugs, or diuretics), intravenous fluid bolus or blood product administration, glucose administration, or administration of analgesics, sedatives, naloxone, flumazenil, or antipsychotics. Immediate outcome of the ERT was categorized as follows: remained in the previous hospital setting with or without intervention, transfer to a monitored ward, transfer to the operating room for exploration or treatment, or death.\n\n【48】### Outcomes\n\n【49】Postoperative complications that occurred within the first 30 postoperative days were reported. Information was obtained from the medical records from the index hospitalization, rehospitalization, or outpatient visits. A 30-day mortality rate was calculated. Postoperative complications included myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, respiratory failure requiring tracheal reintubation, acute kidney injury (serum creatinine increase >1 mg/dL and above 1.5 mg/dL \\[to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4\\]), thromboembolic event, sepsis or multiorgan failure, blood transfusion requirement, or death. Causes of death were recorded. Total days in the ICU and hospital were recorded.\n\n【50】### Statistical Analyses\n\n【51】Data are summarized using mean ± SD or median with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables and frequency percentage for nominal variables. To estimate the incidence of ERT activation, a denominator was obtained using information provided by the revenue accounting office; it was based on patient counts after excluding all surgical or procedural categories of patients expected to be admitted to monitored wards (eg, cardiac, major vascular, thoracic). Of note, this denominator was not reduced to account for other planned or unplanned admissions to monitored wards in patients undergoing operations that do not routinely require this level of postoperative care. Two sets of analyses comparing characteristics between ERT cases and controls were performed. One analysis included all ERT cases and compared characteristics between cases and controls using the 2-sample _t_ test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. The other analysis excluded ERT cases for which no matched controls could be identified and was performed using conditional logistic regression, taking into account the matched study design. Characteristics found to have evidence ( _P_ <.05) of an association in univariate analyses were included as explanatory variables in a multiple logistic regression model with ERT activation as the dependent variable. In all cases, 2-tailed _P_ values of .05 or less were considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (Version 9.2, SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC).\n\n【52】Results\n-------\n\n【53】During the study period approximately 95,000 patients underwent surgery or diagnostic procedures requiring anesthesia and were discharged to a regular ward. Of those, 181 patients required ERT activation within 48 hours; therefore, the estimated rate of ERT activation in this population was 2 per 1000 anesthetic administrations (0.2%). Of these events, 168 (93%) were RRT, and 13 (7%) were code team activations. Of the code team activations, 6 met the institutional definition of a code (5 patients received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and in one patient the trachea was intubated to protect the airway in the context of acute mental status changes). In the other 7 patients, the code team was activated for reasons other than cardiopulmonary collapse (eg, transient syncope, hypotension). Of the entire cohort, 81 patients (45%) underwent general or urologic surgery; 62 (34%), orthopedic surgery; 19 (10%), gynecologic surgery; 11 (6%), otolaryngological surgery; 5 (3%), neurosurgery; and l3 (7%), diagnostic procedures or minor operations requiring anesthetic care outside the operating room.\n\n【54】The majority (N=113; 62.4%) of ERT interventions occurred during the first 12 hours after surgery, and more than three-fourths (142; 78.5%) occurred within the first 24 hours . The mean time from ERT activation to team arrival was 4±2 minutes. Table 1 describes the reasons for ERT activation and types of interventions. The most frequent reasons for ERT activation were hypotension in 58 patients (32%), cardiac in 36 (20%), and pulmonary in 31 (17%). In all cases a physician on the ERT assessed the patient and made decisions regarding treatment and disposition. Immediate outcomes of ERT activation are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【55】FIGURE Cumulative frequency of time to emergency response team (ERT) activation.\n\n【56】TABLE 1 Causes for Emergency Response Team (ERT) Activation and Specific Interventions During ERT Call\n\n| Characteristic | Patients (N=181) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes for ERT activation | Causes for ERT activation |\n| Hypotension | 58 (32) |\n| Cardiac | 36 (20) |\n| Pulmonary | 31 (17) |\n| Neurologic | 23 (13) |\n| Pain/psychiatric issues | 17 (9) |\n| Drug interactions | 12 (7) |\n| Hypertension | 3 (2) |\n| Epistaxis | 1 (1) |\n| Specific interventions | Specific interventions |\n| Chest compressions | 5 (3) |\n| Defibrillation/cardioversion | 2 (1) |\n| Tracheal intubation | 5 (3) |\n| Noninvasive ventilation | 9 (5) |\n| Other interventions and medications administered | Other interventions and medications administered |\n| Intravenous fluid bolus | 63 (35) |\n| Naloxone | 16 (9) |\n| Opioids | 12 (7) |\n| Blood transfusion | 10 (6) |\n| Vasopressors (epinephrine, phenylephrine) | 5 (3) |\n| Bronchodilator | 5 (3) |\n| Benzodiazepine | 3 (2) |\n| Anticholinergic (atropine) | 2 (1) |\n| Flumazenil | 2 (1) |\n| Antiarrhythmic (amiodarone) | 2 (1) |\n| Diuretic (furosemide) | 1 (1) |\n| 50% glucose intravenous bolus | 2 (1) |\n| Antihypertensive (labetalol, hydralazine) | 1 (1) |\n| Nitroglycerin | 1 (1) |\n| Immediate outcome | Immediate outcome |\n| Death | 2 (1) |\n| Transfer to surgery | 4 (2) |\n| Transfer to monitored ward | 71 (39) |\n| Treatment on regular ward | 57 (32) |\n| Continued observation on regular ward | 47 (26) |\n\n【58】Data are presented as No. (percentage).\n\n【59】The median ICU length of stay of patients transferred to a monitored ward was 2 days (IQR, 2-4 days). Two patients died during code team calls, both from massive saddle pulmonary emboli associated with a cardiac arrest. The administration of a fluid bolus (N=63; 35%) was the most common overall intervention, followed by naloxone administration (N=16; 9%) and opioid administration (N=12; 7%) .\n\n【60】Using previously described matching criteria, we identified 318 controls for these 181 ERT patients. For 154 ERT patients (85%) we identified 2 matched controls; for 10 ERT patients (6%) only 1 control could be identified, and for 17 ERT patients (9%) no controls could be identified because the patient underwent an operation that was uncommon or that rarely requires anesthesia. Clinical and demographic features of ERT cases and controls are summarized in Table 2 . ERT and control groups were similar with the exceptions of higher rates of central neurologic diseases and preoperative use of opioid analgesics in ERT patients. Among 18 ERT patients (10%) with preexisting central neurologic diseases, 5 (28%) had an ERT activation for worsening neurologic status. Among 55 ERT patients (30%) who used opioids, 7 (13%) received naloxone during the ERT intervention.\n\n【61】TABLE 2 Demographics and Preoperative Comorbidities in Controls and in Patients Who Subsequently Required Emergency Response Team (ERT) Activation\n\n| Variable | Control (N=318)aData are presented as No. (percentage) unless indicated otherwise.

The ERT patient who died out of hospital was a 94-year-old woman who previously underwent a left hemimandibulectomy.\n\n【93】Discussion\n----------\n\n【94】Recovery from surgery or diagnostic procedures requiring anesthesia may be associated with complications. To avoid serious morbidities, it is important to anticipate potential problems so that preemptive measures can be implemented. Our study demonstrated that preoperative scheduled use of opioids, history of central neurologic disease, and hemodynamic instability during surgery were characteristics independently associated with unexpected deterioration within the first 48 postoperative hours. The majority of ERT calls occurred within the first 24 postoperative hours, most often for hypotension, mental status changes, or respiratory problems. Despite the fact that some patients in the ERT cohort required minimal to no intervention, ERT patients had more severe in-hospital complications.\n\n【95】ERTs have been established to intervene quickly to mitigate sudden deterioration of patients' health. Although this initiative intuitively appears effective, ERT outcomes are difficult to assess. ERT intervention may reduce ICU resource utilization\n\n【96】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【97】Medical emergency teams at The Ottawa Hospital: the first two years.\n\n【98】and immediate mortality after cardiac arrest.\n\n【99】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【100】The effect of a rapid response team on major clinical outcome measures in a community hospital.\n\n【101】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【102】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【103】Prospective controlled trial of effect of medical emergency team on postoperative morbidity and mortality rates.\n\n【104】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【105】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【106】Postoperative serious adverse events in a teaching hospital: a prospective study.\n\n【107】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【108】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【109】A prospective before-and-after trial of a medical emergency team.\n\n【110】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【111】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【112】Use of medical emergency team responses to reduce hospital cardiopulmonary arrests.\n\n【113】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【114】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【115】Long term effect of a medical emergency team on cardiac arrests in a teaching hospital.\n\n【116】However, a large meta-analysis did not find evidence that these initiatives reduce the overall in-hospital mortality.\n\n【117】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【118】Rapid response teams: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【119】In contrast, introduction of ERTs was found to increase long-term survival in surgical patients.\n\n【120】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【121】Long-term effect of a medical emergency team on mortality in a teaching hospital.\n\n【122】This discrepancy\n\n【123】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【124】Rapid response teams: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【125】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【126】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【127】Long-term effect of a medical emergency team on mortality in a teaching hospital.\n\n【128】may be related to differences in disease complexity between surgical and medical patients. Surgical critical events may be associated with more reversible causes (bleeding, oversedation, hypotension), whereas medical critical events may be related to advanced or terminal conditions. If this is true, then implementation of ERTs, better triage of higher-risk patients, or both may improve postoperative morbidity and mortality.\n\n【129】Characteristics used to predict ERT activation have been reported only once.\n\n【130】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【131】Early postoperative emergencies requiring an intensive care team intervention: the role of ASA physical status and after-hours surgery.\n\n【132】A small case-control study identified ASA Physical Status class 3 or greater and after-hours surgery as predictors.

In our larger series, we identified 3 markers for increased postoperative ERT activation.\n\n【139】The first predictor was preoperative opioid therapy that led to respiratory depression and oversedation (as evidenced by a higher rate of naloxone administration). Other investigators also reported that patient-controlled analgesia\n\n【140】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【141】Continuous oximetry/capnometry monitoring reveals frequent desaturation and bradypnea during patient-controlled analgesia.\n\n【142】and intravenous morphine have been associated with higher rates of ERT activation for respiratory depression.\n\n【143】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【144】Opioids and code blue emergencies.\n\n【145】Furthermore, it is known that opioid-tolerant patients postoperatively report greater intensity of pain and use more opioid analgesics than opioid-naïve patients.\n\n【146】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【147】Acute pain: lessons learned from 25,000 patients.\n\n【148】A retrospective case-control series found that 47.8% of opioid-tolerant patients experienced postoperative moderate to severe sedation compared with 18.5% of opioid-naïve patients.\n\n【149】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【150】Acute pain management in patients with prior opioid consumption: a case-controlled retrospective review.\n\n【151】A higher proportion of these patients in our study received naloxone (N=7 \\[13%\\] vs N=9 \\[7%\\]), further suggesting the need for increased vigilance for signs of oversedation.\n\n【152】The second predictor was the use of phenylephrine infusions and greater intravenous fluid administration. At our institution we correct brief episodes of hypotension with boluses of ephedrine or phenylephrine but typically initiate phenylephrine infusions, in addition to fluid boluses, when hypotension persists. Of note, these patients received more intraoperative fluids (crystalloids and colloids) compared with the average amounts given to the remainder of ERT patients . We consequently used the initiation of “phenylephrine infusion” as a surrogate for more pronounced hemodynamic instability. At our institution, phenylephrine infusion is considered a temporizing measure to correct for factors associated with perioperative hypotension, and it is widely viewed as a benign intervention. However, among ERT patients who required phenylephrine infusion, postoperative hypotension was the most common indication for ERT activation. Therefore, our perception that a phenylephrine infusion is not a marker for subsequent instability, even after a stable hemodynamic course in the PACU, needs to be reexamined. Another study demonstrated that intraoperative hypotension predicts postoperative adverse events.\n\n【153】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【154】Preoperative and intraoperative predictors of cardiac adverse events after general, vascular, and urological surgery.\n\n【155】A third predictor was a history of central neurologic disease. Preexisting cognitive dysfunction is a strong predictor of postoperative delirium.\n\n【156】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【157】Postoperative delirium in the elderly: risk factors and outcomes.\n\n【158】In our patients, acute postoperative decline in neurologic function was a frequent cause for ERT activation. Similarly, Lee et al\n\n【159】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【160】Early postoperative emergencies requiring an intensive care team intervention: the role of ASA physical status and after-hours surgery.\n\n【161】reported a decline in mental status as a common reason for ERT activation; however, they did not comment on preoperative neurologic disease as a risk factor. The relatively small number of patients in our study with this condition precludes us from making a general recommendation regarding preemptive triage of these patients to a higher level of postoperative care. Furthermore, the hospital outcomes of these patients were good; more than 50% did not require transfer to a higher level of care after ERT activation.\n\n【162】The PACU course was generally uneventful in our patients, which is not surprising because to be included in our study, they needed to be in sufficiently stable condition to warrant discharge to regular wards.\n\n【163】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【164】The post-anesthesia recovery score revisited.\n\n【165】A study of respiratory and cardiovascular events in the PACU demonstrated that tachycardia and hypertension were predictive of unplanned ICU admission and increased mortality, demonstrating a relationship between early postoperative clinical deterioration and long-term outcomes.\n\n【166】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【167】Cardiovascular events in the postanesthesia care unit: contribution of risk factors.\n\n【168】Furthermore, this study revealed a strong tendency for patients to exhibit similar cardiovascular events intraoperatively and in the PACU.\n\n【169】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【170】Cardiovascular events in the postanesthesia care unit: contribution of risk factors.\n\n【171】In our study, patients with intraoperative hypotension had unremarkable PACU stays, and yet some experienced subsequent hemodynamic instability. This suggests that the aggressive volume replacement combined with intensive monitoring maintained hemodynamic stability throughout the PACU stay. However, the underlying comorbidities or conditions that led to subsequent instability after discharge to a regular ward were either not manifest or not recognized in the PACU.\n\n【172】This is a retrospective study with all inherent limitations. Because we limited our study to ERT calls during the first 48 postoperative hours, we could have missed significant complications that occurred outside that time frame but still were related to anesthesia and surgery. Despite the existence of well-defined clinical criteria for ERT activation, considerable subjectivity is involved. More specifically, activation is triggered typically by allied health care professionals with varied levels of training; therefore, some ERT activations were initiated for noncritical reasons (eg, epistaxis), which affects the ability to identify factors associated with increased odds for more severe events. This is reflected in our data in that 47 ERT activations (26%) resulted in no intervention by the team. This is also the reason why we decided to include cases from both RRT and code team activations; ie, the reasons why one team was activated over the other are at times arbitrary. Regardless, we think that activation of either team represents an acute unexpected health decompensation and thus is relevant for study. We believe our reported incidence represents an underestimate because invariably some patients were discharged to the ICU for other reasons but were still included in the denominator. However, our incidence of 0.2% is similar to a previous report.\n\n【173】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【174】Early postoperative emergencies requiring an intensive care team intervention: the role of ASA physical status and after-hours surgery.\n\n【175】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【176】Patients with preoperative central neurologic disease, scheduled preoperative opioid use, or intraoperative hemodynamic instability were found to be at increased risk for ERT activation within 48 postoperative hours. More vigilant monitoring of such patients may be warranted in the immediate postoperative period.\n\n【177】Acknowledgement\n---------------\n\n【178】We are thankful to Andrew Hanson for assistance with data management and statistical analyses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

He had a 10-week history of worsening pain in his left toes. His mother was present during the initial history taking and reported progressive blackening of the third and fourth toes during the past 4 weeks. Four days before admission, a physician at a hospital elsewhere noted a pustule on the base of the third toe and erythema of the foot and initiated ciprofloxacin therapy. On admission, the patient rated the pain in his left foot as an 8 on a 10-point scale; he was able to obtain substantial pain relief through dependent positioning. He had been healthy until age 29 years, at which time he noted right foot numbness while playing tennis. At that time, lower-extremity arterial thrombi of unclear etiology were noted, and the patient underwent right anterior tibial and bilateral femoral artery thrombectomy. Surgical details were not readily available; however, the patient stated that after surgery he started taking the phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol (for lower extremity claudication) and began receiving long-term warfarin therapy with excellent international normalized ratio control.\n\n【1】*   1.\n\n【2】    _Given the initial history and findings on examination, which one of the following admitting diagnoses is least likely?_\n\n【3】    *   a.\n\n【4】        _Diabetes mellitus_\n\n【5】    *   b.\n\n【6】        _Warfarin-induced necrosis_\n\n【7】    *   c.\n\n【8】        _Primary vasculitic disease_\n\n【9】    *   d.\n\n【10】        _Embolic disease_\n\n【11】    *   e.\n\n【12】        _Traumatic injury_\n\n【13】Given the limited history, the admission differential should be kept broad. Diabetes mellitus should be investigated as an etiology because it is a common cause of foot ulcers and necrotic digits. Ulceration in diabetes is secondary to a mixture of ischemic and neuropathic components. Warfarin-induced necrosis, a rare adverse reaction, is most common in the first few days of warfarin therapy and is associated with administration of a large initial dose of the drug.\n\n【14】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【15】Warfarin induced skin necrosis.\n\n【16】The patient's long-term warfarin therapy and well-controlled international normalized ratio make this the least likely diagnosis. Primary vasculitic diseases, such as giant cell arteritis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, thromboangiitis obliterans, and polyarteritis nodosa, are causes of arterial insufficiency and would be consistent with the findings in this patient. Also supportive of arterial insufficiency was the pain relief achieved while the limb was in a dependent position. Embolic disease can cause distal ischemia, and embolic sources, such as those associated with atherosclerosis, should be further investigated. Traumatic injury should also be included in the admitting differential, especially given that a previous event occurred during exercise.\n\n【17】Further history was obtained to focus the differential diagnosis. The patient denied recent trauma to the lower extremities, fever, chills, and rigors and stated that he otherwise felt well. Other than ciprofloxacin, cilostazol, and warfarin, his only medications were ibuprofen and oxycodone-acetaminophen as needed for pain. The patient had a 15-pack-year smoking history but denied smoking since his numbness when he was age 29 years. He denied any other remarkable medical history relevant to this case.\n\n【18】On admission, the patient had a temperature of 37.2ϒC, blood pressure of 121/79 mm Hg, and a pulse of 78 beats/min. On examination, he appeared athletic and in no distress. Findings on cardiac and pulmonary examinations were normal. Radial pulses were strong and symmetric. The feet were warm, but posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were absent bilaterally. Nonpitting edema (2+) was noted on the left side of the foot, extending to the ankle. Ulceration is depicted in Figure 1 . The patient preferred the dependent position for his left foot and was unable to elevate it for more than a minute without severe pain. No duskiness was noted. His foot displayed a well-demarcated area of erythema with associated warmth and swelling, consistent with cellulitis. According to the patient, these changes were not resolving.\n\n【19】*   2.\n\n【20】    _On hospital admission, which one of the following antimicrobial medications would be most appropriate?_\n\n【21】    *   a.\n\n【22】        _Ciprofloxacin (continued)_\n\n【23】    *   b.\n\n【24】        _Cefazolin_\n\n【25】    *   c.\n\n【26】        _Piperacillin-tazobactam_\n\n【27】    *   d.\n\n【28】        _Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin_\n\n【29】    *   e.\n\n【30】        _Piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and fluconazole_\n\n【31】FIGURE 1 Patient's left foot, showing blackening of the third and fourth toes.\n\n【32】To prevent worsening of disease while further evaluation and diagnostic tests are performed, appropriate choice of antimicrobial medication is crucial. Given the progression of the patient's foot infection despite 4 days of ciprofloxacin therapy, antibiotic coverage should be broadened. Furthermore, continued fluoroquinolone use could complicate anticoagulation management. Cefazolin is often used for cellulitis because of its excellent gram-positive coverage; however, it does not provide the broad-spectrum coverage needed in this case for potential polymicrobial infection. Furthermore, severe foot infections require pseudomonal coverage. Piperacillin-tazobactam provides excellent gram-positive, anaerobic, and gram-negative coverage, including _Pseudomonas_ species. However, given the severity of the infection and the increasing prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus,_\n\n【33】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【34】Epidemiology, treatment, and prevention of community-acquired methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ infections.\n\n【35】vancomycin is also warranted. Because this patient has no evidence of compromised immunity or specific features to suggest a fungal infection, antifungal coverage with fluconazole is unnecessary.\n\n【36】Findings on blood cultures, drawn at admission, were negative after 5 days. On the basis of the appearance of the foot, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate for osteomyelitis. The patient was initially unable to keep his leg elevated for the scan because of pain and required sedation to tolerate the imaging study. Results were worrisome, suggesting osteomyelitis. Further medical evaluation consisted of screening for common causes of vascular insufficiency. Findings on evaluation for diabetes were unremarkable. An autoimmune disease assessment (antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, antiphospholipid antibodies, cryoglobulins, and hepatitis screen) and coagulopathy evaluation (protein C and S levels, activated protein C resistance, and prothrombin mutations) yielded negative results. The patient's serum homocysteine level was not checked.\n\n【37】*   3.\n\n【38】    _Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation and management?_\n\n【39】    *   a.\n\n【40】        _Amputation of the foot_\n\n【41】    *   b.\n\n【42】        _Sural nerve biopsy_\n\n【43】    *   c.\n\n【44】        _Fat pad aspiration_\n\n【45】    *   d.\n\n【46】        _Distal nerve blockade with lidocaine/epinephrine_\n\n【47】    *   e.\n\n【48】        _Angiography_\n\n【49】Although amputation of the foot may be necessary at a later point in this patient's management given the finding of probable osteomyelitis, it is not the best choice at this time because further work-up and diagnostic evaluation to determine a cause are needed first. Sural nerve biopsy can be useful in detection of many systemic disorders that can lead to foot ischemia and peripheral neuropathy, including diabetes and rheumatoid vasculitis. However, given an unremarkable diabetes work-up and normal results on autoimmune studies, the yield of sural nerve biopsy would be low. Indeed, indications for sural nerve biopsy are dwindling.\n\n【50】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【51】Dwindling indications for sural nerve biopsy \\[editorial\\].\n\n【52】Fat pad aspiration is an invasive diagnostic study for evaluation of amyloidosis. Amyloidosis, which typically presents with diffuse, multiorgan involvement, would not be likely in this patient with localized limb ischemia. Although pain control is an important part of management of foot ischemia, administration of lidocaine and epinephrine is inappropriate in this case. Infections create an acidic environment, which complicates dosing of local anesthetics given a predilection for ionization at lower pH. Epinephrine can also lead to further vascular compromise in a distal extremity, worsening the ischemia. Angiography is appropriate to further evaluate for vasculitic etiologies of arterial insufficiency.\n\n【53】Lower-extremity arteriography revealed diffuse medium-to-small vessel disease, worse on the left, consistent with vasculitis . Specifically, the angiogram depicts obliteration of the left anterior and posterior tibial arteries.\n\n【54】*   4.\n\n【55】    _Given the findings on arteriographic study, which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in evaluation and management?_\n\n【56】    *   a.\n\n【57】        _Place an inferior vena cava filter_\n\n【58】    *   b.\n\n【59】        _Perform aortofemoral bypass surgery_\n\n【60】    *   c.\n\n【61】        _Readdress smoking history_\n\n【62】    *   d.\n\n【63】        _Perform exercise electrocardiography_\n\n【64】    *   e.\n\n【65】        _Initiate clopidogrel_\n\n【66】FIGURE 2 Lower-extremity arteriogram showing diffuse medium-to-small vessel disease, worse on the left.\n\n【67】Inferior vena cava filter placement is performed in patients with lower-extremity venous thrombosis who demonstrate either failure of or contraindications to anticoagulation. It is not appropriate in the setting of arterial diseasewith no evidence of venous thrombus. Aortofemoral bypass surgery would be a reasonable choice for large-vessel arterial disease. However, the angiogram shows medium-to-small vessel disease; thus aortofemoral bypass is not indicated. Readdressing the smoking history, particularly given that the original history was obtained in the presence of the patient's mother, is the best choice given the findings consistent with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease). Additional discussion with the patient yielded a different history than previously obtained. Although cardiac evaluation should be pursued in patients with arterial disease, this patient would not be a candidate for exercise electrocardiography because of lower-extremity infection and pain. Clopidogrel, a platelet inhibitor that irreversibly blocks the adenosine diphosphate receptor on platelet cell membranes, is used for prevention of ischemia in patients with atherosclerotic disease. However, the angiogram shows evidence of vasculitis, not atherosclerotic disease, and thus clopidogrel therapy is not indicated.\n\n【68】When his mother was not present, the patient admitted that he had been smoking intermittently after his thrombectomy but denied other drug use. Given this additional history, Buerger disease was established as a working diagnosis.\n\n【69】*   5.\n\n【70】    _Which one of the following, if established, would greatly increase the likelihood of the presumed diagnosis?_\n\n【71】    *   a.\n\n【72】        _Lack of response to nitroprusside_\n\n【73】    *   b.\n\n【74】        _Consistent arteriographic findings in noninvolved limbs_\n\n【75】    *   c.\n\n【76】        _Subungual hemorrhage_\n\n【77】    *   d.\n\n【78】        _Family history of disease_\n\n【79】    *   e.\n\n【80】        _Elevated sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels_\n\n【81】Although endothelium-dependent relaxation is impaired in patients with Buerger disease, non-endothelium-dependent mechanisms appear to be intact\n\n【82】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【83】Impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in peripheral vasculature of patients with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease).\n\n【84】 thus, results of nitroprusside administration are not diagnostic for Buerger disease.

Unlike many other forms of vasculitis, acute phase reactants, such as sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels, are typically normal in Buerger disease; however, this phenomenon is not diagnostic.\n\n【91】The patient was also found to have small-vessel disease of the hand on arteriographic study despite normal radial and ulnar pulses, capillary refill, and extremity warmth, as well as negative results on Allen test. Given these findings and an otherwise negative work-up, Buerger disease was suspected.\n\n【92】When the subject of smoking cessation was addressed, the patient insisted that he would never smoke again. He was offered below-the-knee amputation, which he refused.

The patient was dismissed on hospital day 7 with a Rooke boot, an intermittent pneumatic pump, a peripherally inserted central catheter for continued antibiotic therapy, low-molecular-weight heparin for at least 4 weeks, morphine for pain control, and close follow-up.\n\n【96】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【97】Buerger disease is an episodic, nonatherosclerotic, segmental vascular disease of small- and medium-sized arteries that typically affects multiple limbs and is triggered by tobacco exposure.\n\n【98】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【99】Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease).\n\n【100】Buerger disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, and diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, hypercoagulable states, and embolic disease must first be ruled out.\n\n【101】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【102】Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease).\n\n【103】In general, Buerger disease manifests in people younger than 45 years who currently use tobacco or have a history of recent tobacco use and distal-extremity ischemia.\n\n【104】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【105】Diagnostic criteria of Buerger's disease.\n\n【106】Smoking history is an important feature in Buerger disease; however, the amount of tobacco use is not necessarily a marker of disease.

My article does not conclude that all fibromyalgia patients should be treated with narcotics. To quote: “Opiates are seldom the first choice of analgesics in chronic pain states, but they should not be withheld if less powerful analgesics have failed.”\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】Emerging concepts in the ncurobiology of chronic pain: evidence of abnormal sensory processing in fibromyaigia.\n\n【3】The article goes on to say, “Drug treatment of complex chronic pain should ideally be part of a structured program that includes education, treatment of depression and other psychologic issues, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and exercise.” Pain is a complex experience that has a complex pathophysiological basis. The extent to which a person with chronic pain suffers is certainly affected by cultural factors, past experiences, socioeconomic factors, emotional support, and psychological distress. Thus, my article stresses that the best treatment of complex chronic pain is by a multidisciplinary team that usually includes a pain specialist, a psychologist, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist, and a social worker.\n\n【4】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【5】Multidisciplinary group programs to treat fibromyaigia patients.\n\n【6】Several studies have shown that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or tricyclics seldom provide great benefit in fibromyalgia.\n\n【7】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【8】Controlled trials of therapy in fibromyaigia syndrome.\n\n【9】As I noted in my article, tramadol is a useful drug in the management of chronic pain states and is now my first choice for pain management in fibromyalgia patients. If a patient who has otherwise been compliant in other aspects of a management program is getting insufficient pain relief, the use of opioid analgesics should be considered carefully,\n\n【10】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【11】Chronic opioid therapy in nonmalignant pain.\n\n【12】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【13】Comprehensive pretreatment and outcome assessment for chronic opioid therapy in nonmalignant pain.\n\n【14】An appropriately informed patient would understand that such medications will not provide total pain relief and that their chronic use would always be associated with varying degrees of constipation and sometimes mental fuzziness (although this tends to clear with time) and that they will develop a dependence on the drugs—this means the drugs cannot be stopped abruptly without the development of a withdrawal reaction.\n\n【15】Dependence is a normal physiological phenomenon and should not be confused with addiction. Addiction implies compulsive and self-destructive use of an opioid analgesic for its psychoactive properties, rather than pain relief. All the current evidence indicates that the chronic use of opioid analgesics in chronic pain states seldom leads to addiction. Indeed, most studies have shown an addiction rate of less than 5% in chronic pain patients receiving narcotic analgesics.\n\n【16】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【17】Long-term oral opioid therapy in patients with chronic nonmalignant pain.\n\n【18】With reference to the statement, “Most physicians with a broad-based practice have observed that a large percentage of chronic pain patients who start out on narcotics require escalating doses and exhibit dysfunctional behavior, commonly termed ‘drug-seeking behavior,” such patients may indeed have become addicted to the psychoactive effects of the narcotics, but the other possibility that needs to be considered is that the escalating dose is due to poor pain control as tolerance has developed.\n\n【19】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【20】Opioid use in the treatment of chronic pain: assessment of addiction.\n\n【21】Some patients appear manipulative and frustrated because they are seeking adequate doses of their analgesics for pain relief, not for psychoactive effects. This clinical picture is termed _pseudoaddiction_ .\n\n【22】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【23】Opioid pseudoaddiction—an iatrogenic syndrome.\n\n【24】These patients usually normalize their so-called drug-seeking behavior when their pain is under better control. If a physician is concerned about escalating addictive behavior, the patient should be referred to a pain treatment specialist or program.\n\n【25】The fact that Sartin does not “believe” that chronic pain states like fibromyalgia without notable objective abnormalities should be treated with narcotics betrays a moralistic judgment that unfortunately is still all too common. The aim of my article was to point out that there is now an impressive scientific basis for understanding central pain states like fibromyalgia, which by definition do not have clinical objective abnormalities in the sense of a peripheral tissue pathology. Objective abnormalities, however, are found using sophisticated research tools, and these were reviewed in my article. To those should be added the recent finding of a 4-fold elevation of cerebrospinal fluid levels of nerve growth factor.\n\n【26】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【27】Increased concentrations of nerve growth factor in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with fibromyaigia.\n\n【28】There is a revolution taking place in our understanding and management of chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia.

All patients had previous cardiac hospitalizations within the preceding year. Four cardiac rehabilitation eligible groups of patients were balanced using propensity score weights: (1) no referral; (2) no participation; (3) low participation levels (ie, attending <67% of prescheduled classes); and (4) high participation levels (ie, attending ≥67% prescheduled classes). Each group of patients was balanced in age, sex, geography, socioeconomic status, previous hospitalizations, ambulatory care conditions, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and previous health care expenditures.

Since the initial reports of mucosal candidiasis, severe weight loss, and _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonia as presenting manifestations of the late stages of immunodeficiency, clinicians have recognized a wide spectrum of manifestations associated with HIV disease. The original reports of severe immunodeficiency were simply the “tip of the iceberg.” Advances in antiretroviral therapy and prevention of opportunistic infections have made early diagnosis important. Recognition of cases in earlier stages facilitates opportunities to prevent transmission throughout the population, especially in high-risk groups and pregnant women. Recent evidence suggests that antiviral therapy for primary HIV infection may beneficially alter the course and long-term outcome in persons infected with HIV. This article reviews common presenting syndromes of HIV to aid clinicians in establishing an earlier diagnosis.\n\n【1】AIDS ( acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ), CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ), CMV ( cytomegalovirus ), CNS ( central nervous system ), HAART ( highly active antiretroviral therapy ), HIV ( human immunodeficiency virus ), ITP ( idiopathic thrombocytopenia ), KS ( Kaposi sarcoma ), MAC ( Mycobacterium aviumcomplex ), STD ( sexually transmitted disease )\n\n【2】Identifying the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at its various stages has important personal and public health implications. At the individual level, early recognition may offer patients a period of adjustment and an understanding of their diagnosis; an opportunity to address comorbidities such as viral hepatitis, substance abuse, and mental illness; and an opportunity to learn the value of medication adherence and the risks and benefits associated with antiretroviral therapy. At the community level, early recognition may facilitate patient education regarding HIV, sexually transmitted disease (STD), and risks of tuberculosis transmission and provide an opportunity to decrease transmission of resistant viruses. Patients identified earlier may have slower disease progression because of the restorative effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on immune function. A patient's early presentation may facilitate better primary and preventive care, which may in turn decrease the effect of comorbid illnesses. Early HIV identification allows for the timely introduction of opportunistic infection prophylaxis, more effective vaccinations and education, and institution of preventive measures. Each of these may affect morbidity and survival. An earlier diagnosis allows clinicians to consider appropriate differential diagnoses when such patients become ill and to institute therapy for opportunistic infections. Identification of asymptomatic HIV-positive women during pregnancy and institution of antiviral therapy allow for a substantial reduction in maternal-fetal transmission of HIV. Despite all these advantages of early diagnosis, patients infected with HIV continue to present late in the course of the disease. A recent study from New York City suggested that even in the HAART era the median CD4 count at initial HIV diagnosis was only 152 cells/µL and that there was no difference in the likelihood of patients presenting ill in 1994 vs 1998.\n\n【3】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【4】Trends in immunologic and clinical status of newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients initiating care in the HAART era.\n\n【5】Several studies have highlighted missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis.\n\n【6】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【7】Trends in immunologic and clinical status of newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients initiating care in the HAART era.\n\n【8】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【9】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【10】Evaluation of initial CD4+ T cell counts in individuals with newly diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus infection, by sex and race, in urban settings.\n\n【11】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【12】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【13】How can clinicians identify such patients earlier? The goal of this article is to highlight opportunities for the clinical diagnosis of HIV throughout the spectrum of manifestations, from primary infection through late-stage disease.\n\n【14】CHANGING FACE OF THE HIV EPIDEMIC\n---------------------------------\n\n【15】The HIV epidemic has evolved from one principally affecting homosexual white men and recipients of blood products to that of heterosexual transmission affecting minorities and women.\n\n【16】The face of the epidemic of HIV varies geographically. In US urban centers and the rural southeast, minorities are affected disproportionately. Many of those affected are the medically underserved. Because of their limited access to medical care, HIV should be considered in these individuals at entry points to care such as walk-in clinics, emergency departments, public health clinics, STD clinics, and drug treatment programs. Another major demographic change is the proportion of women affected by HIV. Women in the United States are the most rapidly growing group, from 7% of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in 1985 to 30% in 1999.\n\n【17】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【18】Evaluation and management of HIV-infected women.\n\n【19】In particular, the rate of HIV infection among African American women is 1 in 160 vs 1 in 3000 white women in the United States.\n\n【20】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【21】Evaluation and management of HIV-infected women.\n\n【22】Most of these women are from low-income groups and are of childbearing age. Because of this demographic shift and the ability of clinicians to provide interventions that may improve both maternal and fetal health, all pregnant women should be screened for HIV infection.\n\n【23】Conversely, despite overall declines in their infection rates, a new generation of men who have sex with men continue to engage in high-risk sexual behavior under the misconception that they may be protected by antiviral therapy. Of particular concern in this group is the transmission of multiply resistant strains of HIV because of prior antiviral drug experience.\n\n【24】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【25】Transmission and prevalence of HIV resistance among treatment-naïve subjects.\n\n【26】Some of these individuals may present immediately after exposure to HIV in search of “postexposure” prophylaxis. Thus, the initial step in recognizing HIV is to think about the disease in persons at risk.\n\n【27】SPECTRUM OF CLINICAL DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH HIV INFECTION\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Human immunodeficiency virus is a disorder of immune dysregulation that leads to a continuous spectrum of manifestations, ranging from an overactive and misdirected immune response to severe cellular immunodeficiency. Clinical manifestations vary depending on the stage of HIV.\n\n【29】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【30】The 2002 Abbreviated Guide to Medical Management of HIV Infection. Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore, Md 2002\n\n【31】After primary infection, the stages of HIV are arbitrarily defined by the CD4 cell count: early (CD4 >500 cells/µL), intermediate-middle (CD4 200-500 cells/µL), advanced (CD4 100-200 cells/µL), and late-stage disease (CD4 <100 cells/µL). There is much individual variation in the clinical manifestations in the same disease stage and in the rate of progression through these stages.\n\n【32】PRIMARY HIV INFECTION\n---------------------\n\n【33】Clinical recognition of primary HIV infection is important for several reasons: early treatment may diminish the initial assault of HIV on the immune system, allowing preservation of HIV-specific immune responses; the initial burst of viremia may be more homogeneous, making treatment more effective at decreasing the latently infected viral reservoir and decreasing the role of resistant subpopulations; and a decrease in the extremely high initial viral load may diminish transmission during the period before seroconversion occurs.\n\n【34】Many patients experience an acute self-limited viral syndrome within weeks of primary HIV infection, which may persist for several weeks. The hallmarks of primary HIV infection are fever, rash, and myalgias, which mimic a mononucleosis syndrome.\n\n【35】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【36】Diagnosis of primary HIV-1 infection: Los Angeles County Primary HIV Infection Recruitment Network.\n\n【37】Other manifestations of pri mary HIV infection include fatigue, malaise, arthralgias, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, pharyngitis, headache, retro-orbital pain, meningitis and encephalitis, neuropathy, myelopathy, maculopapular rash, and mucocutaneous ulceration. Lymphadenopathy typically occurs in the second week of the syndrome and may be generalized or may principally affect the occipital, axillary, and cervical nodes. In some cases, there may be profound but transient immunodeficiency with the development of oral and esophageal candidiasis, _Pneumocystis carinii_ pneumonia, and other opportunistic infections. Even astute clinicians may miss the diagnosis at this earliest stage unless a thorough history is obtained to elicit the potential risk of acute HIV infection. These risks include unprotected sex with an infected partner, recent intravenous drug use, and exposure to contaminated blood products or bodily fluids from an infected person with a high HIV viral load. Early identification at this stage may be critical in allowing interventions that can alter the long-term host response to HIV. Once this phase has passed, most persons become clinically asymptomatic, and a window of opportunity for early diagnosis may be lost. Thus, the second step in recognizing HIV is an awareness of the acute HIV syndrome.\n\n【38】CHRONIC HIV INFECTION\n---------------------\n\n【39】A third opportunity for diagnosis occurs during the chronic but “clinically latent” phase. During this phase, patients may have minimal or no symptoms until late in the middle stage. However, there are ongoing immunologic, virological, and clinical changes that are clues to the recognition of HIV. Many of these manifest cutaneously. As immunosuppression proceeds, patients may develop nonspecific symptoms such as fever, night sweats, weight loss, and decreased energy. These symptoms may be subtle and attributed to other causes. Also, during this phase, fever, lymphadenopathy, and malaise may be due to systemic infections such as tuberculosis, mycoses, or lymphoma. Many patients have painless stable lymphadenopathy, which may regress as HIV disease advances and destroys the architecture of lymphoid follicles. Frequently, the parotid glands enlarge or a lymphoepithelial cyst develops in the parotid region because of lymphoid hyperplasia. Anergy to skin testing becomes increasingly probable as the CD4 <sup>+ </sup> count decreases below 400 cells/µL. Common episodic conditions during this stage include herpes zoster, thrush, seborrheic dermatitis, skin and nail infections (impetigo, folliculitis, fungal intertrigo, paronychia), and bacterial infections (pneumonias, bronchitis, sinusitis).\n\n【40】### Mucosal Clues\n\n【41】The earliest physical signs of HIV infection tend to occur on mucosal surfaces of the mouth and vagina and on the skin in asymptomatic patients. Oral manifestations range from oral candidiasis and hairy leukoplakia to ulcerative lesions and severe gingivitis. Pseudomembranous candidiasis (thrush) appears as white cottage cheese-like plaques anywhere in the mouth. Erythematous candidiasis appears as a flat red palatal lesion.\n\n【42】Hairy leukoplakia appears as white hairlike projections, usually on the lateral aspect of the tongue, and cannot be removed by swabbing. Gynecologic infections are the most common reason why HIV-infected women present for medical evaluation, and HIV counseling and testing can be offered at this visit.\n\n【43】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【44】Evaluation and management of HIV-infected women.\n\n【45】In women, recurrent and refractory vulvovaginal candidiasis may be a hallmark of HIV infection. Women also have an increased rate of cervical dysplasia and carcinoma in situ.\n\n【46】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【47】Evaluation and management of HIV-infected women.\n\n【48】For men or women who have been recipients of anal sexual intercourse, the anorectal examination should include evaluation for STDs such as papillomavirus infections, herpes simplex, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and anal carcinoma. All patients presenting with STDs should be offered HIV testing.\n\n【49】### Dermatologic Clues\n\n【50】Dermatologic manifestations include bacterial, fungal, viral, neoplastic, and other dermatitides.\n\n【51】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【52】Dermatologic findings and manifestations of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n【53】Staphylococcal infections present as persistent or recurrent folliculitis or superficial abscesses. Fungal rashes manifest as erythematous lesions, usually occurring in the axilla, inframammary areas, or groin. Herpes zoster is 17 times more common in HIV-infected persons than age-matched uninfected persons and is commonly seen early in the course of HIV infection, particularly in healthy-appearing individuals, before the onset of other symptoms.\n\n【54】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【55】Herpes zoster: a possible early clinical sign for the development of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in high-risk individuals.\n\n【56】Finding zoster in a young adult indicates the need to test for HIV. The lesions in HIV-associated zoster may be bullous, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and painful and persist for 2 to 3 weeks. Dermatomal scarring should be sought when individuals at risk for HIV are being evaluated. Recurrent zoster is reported in about 20% of HIV-infected persons and is another clue to the presence of HIV.\n\n【57】Herpes simplex virus infection may occur as clustered vesicles around the mouth, genitals, or anus. Recurrent or severe cases should raise suspicion for immunocompromise. Another cutaneous viral infection associated with HIV is molluscum contagiosum, which presents as pearly white umbilicated papules usually on the face. The presence of multiple or widespread lesions should prompt consideration of HIV. When molluscum-like lesions are seen in association with fever or headache, a serum cryptococcal antigen test should be performed to evaluate for disseminated cryptococcosis.\n\n【58】The onset of psoriasis in an older adult, exacerbation of long-standing stable psoriasis, psoriatic erythroderma, or severe involvement of the axillae and groin should raise suspicion for HIV.\n\n【59】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【60】Molluscum contagiosum in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection: a review of twenty-seven patients.\n\n【61】Severe pruritis or the development of recurrent pruritic papules should prompt the clinician to think of HIV. Pruritic papules may be due to a variety of causes, including bacterial folliculitis, eosinophilic folliculitis, _Demodex_ mites, insect bite reactions, and granuloma annulare.\n\n【62】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【63】Dermatologic findings and manifestations of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).\n\n【64】A relapsing, intensely pruritic eruption of urticarial papules and pustules that appears in crops on the face and trunk of persons with HIV is eosinophilic folliculitis. This disorder typically occurs in HIV-infected persons with helper T-cell counts lower than 200 cells/µL and is an important cutaneous marker of the specific stage of HIV disease.\n\n【65】Seborrheic dermatitis is another common cutaneous manifestation that should raise suspicion for HIV. It occurs in 40% to 80% of patients with symptomatic HIV disease. The lesions are poorly defined faint pink scaly patches predominantly on the scalp, with frequent involvement of the eyebrows, eyelashes, nasolabial folds, and ears. More extensive involvement may occur on the center of the chest, groin, and axillae.\n\n【66】### Laboratory Clues\n\n【67】Immune dysregulation in HIV may lead to polyclonal B-cell activation, decreased immune surveillance for malignancies, and autoantibody production. A variety of laboratory abnormalities that may precede or coincide with clinical manifestations of HIV are cytopenias, hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated partial thromboplastin time, false-positive rapid plasma reagin and antinuclear antibody test results, and antibodies directed at platelets leading to idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP).\n\n【68】Hematologic abnormalities are commonly recognized in most stages of HIV disease and may suggest the diagnosis of HIV. Anemia, common in patients with HIV infection, becomes more severe with advanced disease and is associated with a more rapid progression to AIDS and death in both men and women.\n\n【69】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【70】Psoriasis and human immunodeficiency virus infection.\n\n【71】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【72】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【73】Hematologic manifestations of the human immune deficiency virus (HIV).\n\n【74】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【75】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【76】Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus: clinical manifestations and their relationship to immune deficiency: a report from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort study.\n\n【77】In a study of patients receiving no myelosuppressive therapy, 8% to 18% of asymptomatic HIV-seropositive patients, 20% to 50% of those with symptomatic middle-stage HIV disease, and 71% to 75% of those with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-defined AIDS had anemia.\n\n【78】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【79】Oncological complications of human immunodeficiency virus disease and hematologic consequences of their treatment.\n\n【80】Thrombocytopenia is also encountered at various stages of HIV infection. In the Multicenter AIDS Cohort, 6.7% of participants had platelet counts lower than 150 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L but did not have CDC-defined AIDS. In HIV-related ITP, production of antiplatelet antibodies results in the destruction of platelets.\n\n【81】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【82】Oncological complications of human immunodeficiency virus disease and hematologic consequences of their treatment.\n\n【83】Often an early manifestation of HIV infection, ITP is seen in persons with CD4 <sup>+ </sup> lymphocyte counts averaging between 300 and 600 cells/µL.\n\n【84】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【85】Prevalence and cumulative incidence of and risk factors for anemia in a multicenter cohort study of human immunodeficiency virus-infected and -uninfected women.\n\n【86】Thus, patients presenting with ITP should be tested for HIV. Granulocytopenia is encountered in 13% of asymptomatic HIV patients and in 44% of those with CDC-defined AIDS, and HIV testing should be part of the evaluation for leukopenia.\n\n【87】Because of the decrease in immune surveillance and frequent infection with oncogenic viruses, hematologic malignancies are a common presenting syndrome. The most common malignancies associated with HIV disease are Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There is a 60-fold increase in non-Hodgkin lymphoma among those infected with HIV, and this may be the presenting diagnosis in 4% of persons with AIDS.\n\n【88】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【89】Thrombocytopenia in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus: treatment update.\n\n【90】Human immunodeficiency virus-related KS occurs almost exclusively in HIV-infected homosexual men and is associated with human herpesvirus 8. Isolated KS lesions, as opposed to extensive and rapidly progressive KS, may appear extremely early in HIV disease (CD4+ cell counts >500 cells/ µL). These early isolated KS lesions do not imply a poorer prognosis. Thus, the presence of these malignancies should prompt HIV testing.\n\n【91】PRESENTING ABNORMALITIES OF OTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【92】Respiratory complications in mid-stage HIV are often overlooked because they occur commonly in all adults. These occur with increasing frequency as patients become more immunosuppressed. Persons with HIV are at increased risk for infection and bacteremia with encapsulated bacteria, especially _Streptococcus pneumoniae._ Also, HIV-infected persons have a 6-fold increased prevalence of pneumococcal pneumonia and a 100-fold increase in pneumococcal bacteremia compared with the general population. Tuberculosis is a common coinfection with HIV. Of persons with AIDS, 5% have active tuberculosis. In New York City, 20% to 70% of new cases of tuberculosis occur in HIV-infected minority populations (African Americans and Hispanics). Thus, persons presenting with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, pneumococcal pneumonia especially with bacteremia, and tuberculosis should be suspected of having HIV.\n\n【93】Another common manifestation of HIV in minority populations is renal disease.\n\n【94】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【95】Renal diseases associated with human immunodeficiency virus infection: epidemiology, clinical course, and management.\n\n【96】Almost 90% of these cases occur in Hispanics and African Americans. In 1999, HIV became the third leading cause of end-stage renal disease in African Americans aged 20 to 64 years. The most frequent presentation of HIV-associated nephropathy is marked proteinuria, usually without accompanying hypertension or edema.\n\n【97】Gastrointestinal disorders are one of the most common presentations of HIV. The earliest recognized manifestations of AIDS included marked wasting, “slim disease,” persistent diarrhea, and oral and esophageal candidiasis. Additionally, a host of diarrheal pathogens are commonly recognized at various stages of HIV disease. Before severe immunocompromise, salmonellosis and giardiasis may be common. With progressive immunodeficiency, _Mycobacterium avium_ complex (MAC) and cryptosporidial and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-related diarrhea become more common. MAC frequently presents as a wasting syndrome manifested by fever, sweats, lymphadenopathy, weight loss, diarrhea, anemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Some patients with these pathogens may present with a syndrome that mimics sclerosing cholangitis, known as HIV cholangiopathy. Patients presenting with weight loss and persistent diarrhea should be considered candidates for HIV testing.\n\n【98】Neurologic manifestations, involving both the peripheral and central nervous system (CNS), are common throughout the spectrum of HIV infection. These may range from an acute aseptic meningoencephalitis in primary HIV infection to the development of opportunistic viral, fungal, and parasitic infections of the CNS. One of the most common neurologic features of HIV is neuropathy. Four types of neuropathy are important to recognize as manifestations of HIV disease: distal symmetric polyneuropathy, mononeuropathy multiplex, inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, and progressive lumbosacral polyradiculopathy. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is by far the most common, occurring in 16% of asymptomatic HIV-seropositive patients and 35% of hospitalized persons with HIV.\n\n【99】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【100】Neurologic abnormalities in human immunodeficiency virus infection.\n\n【101】LATE-STAGE HIV AND OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【102】As immunocompromise progresses, persons with HIV may present with the common cadre of opportunistic infections well known as AIDS. Thus, persons presenting with progressive pneumonia, odynophagia refractory to acid suppressive therapy, brain abscesses, chronic meningitis, dementia, and severe neuropathy should all be considered for HIV testing. _Pneumocystis carinii_ is the most common presenting infection in late-stage disease. Systemic symptoms, including fever, fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and weight loss, are prominent, often without identifiable secondary causes. Cryptococcal meningitis may present with subtle findings of headache and fever or with progressive cognitive dysfunction. Dissemination of systemic mycoses, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, and cryptococcosis especially to the CNS should prompt HIV testing.\n\n【103】As the disease advances further and the CD4 <sup>+ </sup> count decreases below 50 cells/µL, additional opportunistic infections as well as CNS non-Hodgkin lymphoma occur commonly, and, in homosexual men, existing KS may become extensive and cause disfigurement and clinically important edema. Visual loss may occur due to CMV retinitis. Central nervous system toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, CMV disease, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occur frequently. Infections due to MAC, CMV, _Strongyloides stercoralis,_ herpes zoster, or tuberculosis, which normally are limited to an organ system or a local anatomical region, may invade tissue or disseminate widely. Simultaneous, clinically important infection by more than 1 pathogen is common. Secondary symptoms become increasingly problematic, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption, muscle wasting, and weakness. Without treatment, such patients die of HIV. However, in the past 6 years, with the introduction of HAART, many HIV-infected persons who initially presented at this late stage have had dramatic immunologic recovery with the development of a group of new syndromes associated with prolonged HIV survival.\n\n【104】PRESENTING SYNDROMES IN PATIENTS RECEIVING HAART\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【105】A final group of syndromes to recognize are those associated with HAART and prolonged HIV survival. Some, such as localized lymphadenitis and CMV immune recovery vitreitis, may be due to immune reconstitution, whereas others are due to adverse effects of medications. In recent years, a spectrum of changes in body habitus and metabolism has emerged among HIV-infected persons receiving HAART.\n\n【106】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【107】Clinical evaluation and management of metabolic and morphologic abnormalities associated with human immunodeficiency virus.\n\n【108】These changes collectively called _HIV-associated lipodystrophy_ include changes in both body fat distribution and disordered fat metabolism. Some patients experience a syndrome of lipoatrophy characterized by marked subcutaneous fat depletion that leads to facial and buttock wasting and the presence of varicosities of the arms and legs due to the subcutaneous fat loss. Another metabolic complication is central or visceral fat accumulation leading to truncal obesity, dorsocervical fat hump, and breast enlargement in both men and women. Insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia are common. A metabolic disorder increasingly recognized as a consequence of HAART with nucleoside analogues is mitochondrial toxicity. This may lead to mitochondrial myopathy and neuropathy and is recognized as the cause of a syndrome of lactic acidosis and hepatic steatosis.\n\n【109】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【110】As we enter the third decade of the HIV epidemic in the United States, the presenting manifestations of this disease have evolved and expanded. It is important for practicing clinicians to recognize the increasing frequency of this disease in minority heterosexual populations in the United States, to recognize its protean manifestations, and to offer testing to those presenting with the syndromes described in this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

He studied glassblowing at Pilchuck Glass School in Seattle, Wash, in 1972. He received further formal art education at the Rhode Island School of Design (Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1974) and the Pratt Institute of Art and Design in Brooklyn, NY (Master of Fine Arts in 1978). Art critic Mathew Kangas finds Statom's use of glass in his sculptures innovative. He has referred to Statom as “one of the most significant and prolific experimental glass artists.” Statom's sculptures consist of temporary constructions and permanent displays, which this critic labels as “a highly important (if subsequently destroyed) body of work.”\n\n【1】As Statom's work has become increasingly well-known, the artist has begun requesting that museums incorporate on-site workshops for innercity children that involve them in all aspects of the construction and design of his style. He is dedicated to sharing his wealth of talent.\n\n【2】Mayo Clinic's mixed media with glass piece by Statom, reminiscent of an abstract painting, catches the viewer's eye. Lively and delightful, the detailed sculpture encourages further exploration. Its colored and opaque components reflect the dance of light all around and complement the main design of the glass and chrome of the Gonda Building itself. Constructed in Statom's signature style, the approximately 13 × 13 foot sculpture contains multicolored created and found pieces of plate glass as well as metal painted and glued together to form abstract rectangular shapes that project images of ladders, tables, high-rises, and houses. It is accented by twists of glass, magic genie bottles, and terra-cotta. By use of technique, medium, and style, the sculpture also challenges the age-old debate of craft vs art, and it concretely manages to bridge the gap between the genres.\n\n【3】This piece is a gift from the Edward F.

Adjusted and unadjusted incidence of AS-related hospitalizations, utilization rates of AVR, in-hospital morbidity and mortality, and resource utilization was compared between whites and African Americans (AAs).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2014, the incidence of AS-related admissions increased from 13 (95% CI, 12.8-13.2) to 26 (95% CI, 25.7-26.4) cases per 100,000 patient-years in whites and from 3 (95% CI, 3.5-3.8) to 9.5 (95% CI, 9.4-9.8) cases per 100,000 patient-years in AAs ( _P_ <.001). The incidence density ratio decreased from 4.3 (95% CI, 2.27-6.6) in 2003 to 2.7 (95% CI, 1.1-3.8) in 2014. The ratio of AVR to AS-related admissions was 11.3% in whites and 6.7% in AAs ( _P_ <.001). Crude in-hospital mortality after AVR was higher in AAs (6.4% vs 4.7%; _P_ <.001). However, after propensity score matching, in-hospital morality after isolated AVR was not significantly different between AAs and whites (4.7% vs 3.7%; _P_ \\=.12). African Americans also had longer hospitalizations (12±12 days vs 10±9 days; _P_ <.001), higher rates of nonhome discharge (32.1% vs 27.2%; _P_ \\=.004), and higher cost of hospitalization ($55,631±$37,773 vs $52,521±$38,040; _P_ <.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusions\n\n【8】African Americans undergo AVR less than whites. The underlying etiology of this disparity is multifactorial, but may be related to a lower incidence of AS in AAs. Aortic valve replacement is associated with similar risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality but higher cost and longer hospitalizations in AAs than in whites.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AA ( African American ), AS ( aortic stenosis ), AVR ( aortic valve replacement ), CABG ( coronary artery bypass grafting ), NIS ( Nationwide Inpatient Sample )\n\n【11】African American (AA) race has been identified as an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and heart transplantation.\n\n【12】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【13】The effect of race on coronary bypass operative mortality.\n\n【14】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【15】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【16】Racial disparities in outcomes of adult heart transplantation.\n\n【17】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【18】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【19】The impact of ethnicity on outcomes following coronary artery bypass graft surgery in the Veterans Health Administration.\n\n【20】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【21】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【22】Explaining racial disparities in outcomes after cardiac surgery: the role of hospital quality.\n\n【23】These findings have been partially attributed to differences in risk profile, socioeconomic factors, and hospital characteristics.\n\n【24】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【25】Explaining racial disparities in outcomes after cardiac surgery: the role of hospital quality.\n\n【26】However, the differential effect of race on the outcomes of isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) operations has been debated.\n\n【27】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【28】Relationship between race and mortality and morbidity after valve replacement surgery.\n\n【29】With the increasing burden of aortic stenosis (AS) and the dramatic change in its management in the past decade, there is a need to understand contemporary racial differences in the utilization and outcomes of AVR. We aim to use the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) to describe the differences in clinical risk profile of white and AA patients undergoing AVR and to investigate disparities in AVR utilization rates, in-hospital outcomes, resource utilization, and cost of care between white and AA patients.\n\n【30】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【31】### Study Data\n\n【32】The NIS was used to derive patient relevant information between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2014. The NIS is the largest publicly available all-payer administrative claims–based database and contains information about patient discharges from approximately 1000 nonfederal hospitals in 45 states. It contains clinical and resource utilization information on 5 to 8 million discharges annually, with safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals. These data are stratified to represent approximately 20% of US inpatient hospitalizations across different hospital and geographic regions (random sample). The national estimates of the entire US hospitalized population were calculated using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality sampling and weighting method.\n\n【33】### Study Population\n\n【34】Patients older than 60 years with a discharge diagnosis of aortic valve stenosis ( _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification_ codes 424.1, 395.0, 395.2, 396.2, 746.3) who underwent AVR ( _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification_ procedure codes 35.20 and 35.21) during the study period were identified from the NIS database.\n\n【35】### Racial Disparity in AS-Related Hospitalization and AVR Utilization\n\n【36】To investigate the possible effect of race on the utilization rates of AVR, we calculated the following:\n\n【37】*   1.\n\n【38】    The incidence of _AS-related admissions_ , defined as hospital admissions with a principal diagnosis of aortic valve disease in patients older than 60 years. The total number of whites and AAs were derived from the US Census data.\n\n【39】*   2.\n\n【40】    The _incidence density ratio_ , defined as relative difference in AS-related admissions between white patients and their AA counterparts.\n\n【41】*   3.\n\n【42】    The _ratio of AVR to AS-related admissions_ in both races. The trends in AVR utilization over the study period were assessed using the Mann-Kendall test.\n\n【43】### Comparative Outcomes Analysis\n\n【44】We aimed to perform a comparative outcomes analysis between white and AA patients undergoing AVR. To account for potential confounding factors and reduce the effect of selection bias, a vigorous propensity score–matching model was developed using logistic regression to derive 2 matched groups for comparative outcomes analysis. After excluding patients who underwent concomitant cardiac operation, patients who underwent “isolated” AVR were entered into a nearest-neighbor 1:1 variable ratio, parallel, balanced propensity score–matching model using a caliper of 0.01 without replacement to ensure perfect matching. Variables included in the propensity score–matching model are listed in Supplemental Table 1 . Patients with missing race data were excluded. To estimate the cost of hospitalization, the NIS data were merged with cost-to-charge ratios available from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. We estimated the cost of each inpatient stay by multiplying the total hospital charge with cost-to-charge ratios. The primary end point was in-hospital death. Secondary end points included _procedural mortality_ (defined as death occurring on the same hospital day as AVR), vascular complications, pacemaker implantation, transient ischemic attack, cerebral vascular accidents, blood transfusion, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, cardiac tamponade, hospital length of stay, cost of hospitalization, and discharge disposition.\n\n【45】### Statistical Analyses\n\n【46】Descriptive statistics were presented as frequencies with percentages for categorical variables and as means with SDs for continuous variables. Baseline characteristics were compared using the Pearson chi-square test and Fisher exact test for categorical variables and the independent-samples _t_ test for continuous variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios with 95% CIs to determine predictors of in-hospital death. Matched categorical variables were presented as frequencies with percentages and compared using the McNemar test. Matched continuous variables were presented as means with SDs and compared using a paired samples _t_ test. A type I error rate of less than .5 was considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 24 (IBM Corporation) and R version 3.3.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).\n\n【47】Results\n-------\n\n【48】Between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2014, the incidence of AS-related admissions increased from 13 (95% CI, 12.8-13.2) to 26 (95% CI, 25.7-26.4) cases per 100,000 patient-years in whites and from 3 (95% CI, 3.5-3.8) to 9.5 (95% CI, 9.4-9.8) cases per 100,000 patient-years in AAs ( _P_ <.001) . The incidence density ratio (ratio of AS-related admission in whites and AAs) decreased from 4.3 (95% CI, 2.27-6.6) in 2003 to 2.7 (95% CI, 1.1-3.8) in 2014. A total of 96,728 patients who were identified as whites or AAs underwent AVR during the study period (weighted national estimates, 478,813 patients), of whom 92,469 (95.6%) were whites and 4259 (4.4%) were AAs. The ratio of AVR to AS-related admissions was 11.3% in whites and 6.7% in AAs ( _P_ <.001), and this ratio remained constant throughout the study period .\n\n【49】Figure 1 Incidence of aortic stenosis–related admissions and aortic valve replacement in whites and African Americans between 2003 and 2014.

Compared with whites, AAs were younger (72±7 years vs 74±8 years; _P_ <.001) and had a lower percentage of male patients (51.7% vs 61.3%; _P_ <.001). African Americans had a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, anemia, and chronic renal disease. In contrast, coronary artery disease and previous sternotomy were more prevalent in whites.

OR = odds ratio.\n\n【93】Discussion\n----------\n\n【94】The principal findings of the present investigations are as follows: (1) AS-related admissions are less common in AAs than in whites, suggesting a lower incidence of AS in the AA population; (2) among patients admitted with AS, AAs are less likely to undergo AVR than whites; (3) AAs had higher unadjusted in-hospital mortality after AVR than did whites. However, after adjusting for age, sex, clinical risk factors, hospital characteristics, and socioeconomic status, the differences in in-hospital mortality between the 2 groups became statistically nonsignificant; and (4) AVR (isolated or concomitant with other cardiac operation) in AAs is associated with higher resource utilization (length of stay, nursing home and intermediate care usage, and cost) compared with whites.\n\n【95】Aortic valve stenosis has been an area of extensive research in the past decade because of the increasing burden of AS and the impressive expansion in its treatment options. It is therefore important to understand risk factors for this disease. To our knowledge, our study is the first nationwide study to date to report a lower incidence of AS-related hospitalizations in AAs than in whites. Because these hospitalization incidence rates reflect elective and nonelective admissions, they are less susceptible to referral bias and these data may therefore suggest a lower prevalence of severe calcific AS in AAs than in whites. This is supported by recent studies suggesting a lower prevalence of severe AS in AAs than in whites.\n\n【96】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【97】Prevalence of mitral valve prolapse and congenital bicuspid aortic valves in black and white patients undergoing cardiac valve operations.\n\n【98】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【99】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【100】Racial differences in rates of aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis.\n\n【101】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【102】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【103】Bicuspid aortic valve: inter-racial difference in frequency and aortic dimensions.\n\n【104】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【105】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【106】Racial differences in the prevalence of severe aortic stenosis.\n\n【107】In the largest of these studies, Patel et al\n\n【108】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【109】Racial differences in the prevalence of severe aortic stenosis.\n\n【110】examined 272,525 transthoracic echocardiograms (81.8% whites and 13.5% AAs) and found that the prevalence of severe AS was 0.91% in whites compared with 0.29% in AAs (adjusted odds ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.36-0.61). To rule out referral bias against patients with severe valvular heart disease, the authors assessed racial disparity in the prevalence of severe mitral regurgitation and found this prevalence to be similar in whites and AAs (1.35% vs 1.45%, respectively). The underlying etiology of this race-related difference in the incidence/prevalence of severe AS may be related to (1) the shorter life expectancy in AAs than in whites (3.5 years in 2015)\n\n【111】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【112】National Center for Health Statistics (US)  \nHealth, United States, 2016: With Chartbook on Long-term Trends in Health.\n\n【113】National Center for Health Statistics (US) , Hyattsville, MD 2017\n\n【114】 (2) a lesser severity of AS in AAs than in their white counterparts.

Nevertheless, we recently found no significant racial disparity in the uptake rates of transcatheter AVR in the United States between 2011 and 2014.\n\n【148】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【149】The overall unadjusted in-hospital mortality was significantly higher in AAs than in whites (6.4% vs 4.7%; _P_ <.001), and this gap was persistent over time. However, after adjusting for patients’ clinical and socioeconomic factors and hospital characteristics, in-hospital mortality after isolated AVR remained numerically higher in AAs but was statistically nonsignificant (4.7% vs 3.7%; _P_ \\=.12). This is likely due to the significant differences in risk profiles, socioeconomic status, treating hospital's characteristics, and presenting symptoms between the 2 groups; most white patients were men (61.3%), whereas there was an equal distribution of sex among AAs undergoing AVR (51.7% men vs 48.3% women). African Americans had a higher incidence of hypertension and diabetes than did whites, but counterintuitively they had a lower incidence of coronary artery disease and previous sternotomy. Utilization rates of nonelective AVR were substantially higher in AAs (45.2% vs 31.3%; _P_ <.001), who also had a higher incidence of cardiogenic shock at presentation (6.2% vs 3.8%; _P_ <.001). Nonelective admission status is an established independent predictor of in-hospital mortality.\n\n【150】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【151】The Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Database 2016 Annual Report.\n\n【152】African Americans were more likely to have a lower median household income, to be uninsured, and to be treated at urban and teaching hospitals.\n\n【153】Resource utilization profiles revealed striking differences between the 2 groups. African Americans were much more likely to receive AVR during nonelective admission than whites (31.3% vs 45.2%; _P_ <.001). This can possibly be related to less vigorous outpatient surveillance and/or reluctance of AAs to undergo elective AVR compared with white patients.\n\n【154】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【155】Racial differences in rates of aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic stenosis.\n\n【156】In-hospital length of stay was also longer and cost of care and discharges to intermediate care facilities were significantly higher in AAs despite similar morbidity and mortality compared with white patients. Similar findings of higher resource utilization in AAs have been reported after coronary stenting and CABG, with a possible role of hospital quality and volume in the disparity in cost and resource utilization.\n\n【157】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【158】The effect of preoperative and hospital characteristics on costs for coronary artery bypass graft.\n\n【159】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【160】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【161】Differences in utilization of drug-eluting stents by race and payer.\n\n【162】This study has a number of limitations:\n\n【163】*   1.\n\n【164】    The NIS is an administrative database that collects data for billing purposes and can be limited by erroneous coding.

The lower utilization rate of AVR in AAs is multifactorial, but may be partially due to a lower incidence of AS in this population. Among patients who underwent AVR, crude in-hospital mortality is higher in AAs, but after adjustment for clinical characteristics, socioeconomic risk factors, and hospital characteristics, this excess mortality became nonstatistically significant. In addition, AVR in AAs was associated with longer hospitalizations, higher cost, and higher utilization of intermediate care facilities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

From 1907 to 1957, he was a professor at various universities in both Poland and Russia and devoted his entire life to improving the practice of internal medicine.\n\n【1】Orlowski was born in Norwipole in the province of Minsk in Byelorussia (White Russia) on January 24, 1874. His father was the manager of an estate. In 1882, when Witold was 8 years old, the family moved to Vilna, the capital of Lithuania, where Witold graduated from high school. He then enrolled in the St Petersburg Military Academy (St Petersburg, Russia), from which he graduated in 1889.\n\n【2】From 1889 to 1901, Orlowski worked at the University Hospital in St Petersburg. In 1907, he became head of the Department of Internal Medicine at the prestigious Russian University in Kazan. In 1920, he left Russia and returned to Poland to become head of the Department of Internal Medicine at the university in Krakow (southern Poland). When the new University of Warsaw opened in 1925, Orlowski organized and developed the Second Department of Internal Medicine.\n\n【3】During World War II (1939-1945), the Nazis removed Orlowski from his post; however, he clandestinely taught medicine to Polish students. After the war, he helped rebuild the Department of Internal Medicine at the University of Warsaw. In 1948, Orlowski retired from the university, but he continued as head of the Municipal Hospital (the former St Lazarus Hospital) in Warsaw until 1957.\n\n【4】Orlowski was the first physician in Russia to use pneumothorax for the management of tuberculosis. He founded several laboratories and outpatient clinics that specialized in internal medicine. In addition to his teaching and clinical work, Orlowski published more than 150 articles and coauthored about 650 articles on numerous topics, including metabolic diseases, cardiology, tuberculosis, and acid-base balance. His greatest achievement was an 8-volume handbook of internal medicine, of which he was the sole author. This monumental work included the pathophysiological, pathological, and clinical aspects of internal medicine and was the basic handbook for generations of Polish physicians. Orlowski was elected president of the Polish Society of Internal Medicine and served as editor-in-chief of the _Polish Archives of Internal Medicine_ . He was mentor to many physicians, and 26 of his protégés became professors of medicine.\n\n【5】Orlowski died in Warsaw on December 2, 1966, at the age of 92 years. In 2006, Poland honored him on a stamp (Scott No. 3831) issued on the centenary of the founding of the Polish Society of Internal Medicine.

Most recent estimates suggest that the US population spends $5 billion per year for herbal supplements alone. Herbal supplements are receiving increasing exposure through national media, in lay journals, and more recently in the scientific press. Interest in herbal medicine has been facilitated by multiple factors, including the perception that. pharmaceutical medications are expensive, overprescribed, and often dangerous. Alternatively, herbal medicine is often perceived as being “natural” and is therefore considered safe. While the growth of the herbal medicine industry in the United States can probably not continue at this accelerated pace indefinitely, there is little indication of any major slowing. Therefore, patients will continue to use herbal medications. Knowledge of these preparations (including their potential benefits and risks as well as their ability to interact with pharmaceutical medications) will enable physicians to provide a balanced and objective view to patients seeking information on herbal therapy.\n\n【1】DSHEA ( Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), NCCAM ( National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ), NF ( National Formulary ), ODS ( Office of Dietary Supplements ), PDR ( Physicians' Desk Reference ), USP ( United States Pharmacopeia )\n\n【2】Based on recent estimates, Americans spend $5 billion annually for herbal supplements. Physicians need to become familiar with the potential risks and benefits of these preparations, as well as their ability to interact with pharmaceutical medications, so that they can discuss these issues with their patients.\n\n【3】HERBS\n-----\n\n【4】By strict botanical definition, an herb is “a seed-producing annual, biennial, or perennial that does not develop persistent woody tissue but dies down at the end of a growing season.”\n\n【5】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【6】Merriam-Webster's Collégiate Dictionary. lOth ed. Merriam-Webster Inc , Springfield, Mass 1993 : 542\n\n【7】Of course, patients and consumers do not adhere to this strict classic definition when inquiring about or using “herbal” products. Another definition for an herb is a “plant or plant part valued for its medicinal, savory, or aromatic qualities.”\n\n【8】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【9】Merriam-Webster's Collégiate Dictionary. lOth ed. Merriam-Webster Inc , Springfield, Mass 1993 : 542\n\n【10】This broader definition is probably closer to most people's concept of herbal medicines. For example, gingko is a popular herb but is actually a tree. To avoid semantic confusion, some experts prefer the term _botanical,_ which encompasses any plant-derived product used for a medicinal or health purpose. Others use the term _phytomedicine_ or _phytotherapeutics_ to denote plant-derived products used for medicinal purposes.\n\n【11】Further complicating the issue is the fact that herbs are also classified as dietary supplements, as a result of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA).\n\n【12】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【13】*   US Food and Drug Administration\n*   Center for Food Safely and Applied Nutrition\n\n【14】Any discussion of herbal therapies requires an understanding of this classification and its regulatory implications.\n\n【15】DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS\n-------------------\n\n【16】For the purposes of the DSHEA, a dietary supplement (1) is a product (other than tobacco) that is intended to supplement the diet that bears or contains 1 or more of the following ingredients: a vitamin, a mineral, an herb or other botanical, an amino acid; (2) is intended for ingestion in pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid form; (3) is not used as a conventional food or as the sale item of a meal or diet; and (4) is labeled as a _dietary supplement._ 2 Of note, this classification of dietary supplements is specifically separate from food or drug categories and, as such, lies outside the jurisdiction of many of the safety and regulatory rules that cover these categories.\n\n【17】### CURRENT REGULATORY STATUS OF HERBS IN THE UNITED STATES\n\n【18】The current regulatory status of herbs is directed by the DSHEA. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, concern was growing regarding the safety of the herbs and other supplements that Americans were consuming in ever-increasing amounts. The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (which resulted from tainted preparations of l \\-tryptophan) was a particularly notable incident of harm arising from these products. Thus, in the early 1990 <sub>S </sub> , the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set forth a proposal to increase the regulatory oversight of this type of product. However, herbal manufacturers and many consumers viewed this as the first step toward eliminating access to dietary supplements. An unusually effective campaign flooded mem bers of Congress with pleas to preserve access to and availability of herbs and other supplements. Congress responded by passing the OSHEA, an act that in many respects had the opposite effect of the FDA proposal. Rather than creating more stringent controls for the quality and safety of herbs, the DSHEA granted some unique exemptions and privileges to the class of agents known as _dietary supplements_ .\n\n【19】The DSHEA created a new and broader definition for dietary supplements that includes vitamins, minerals, herbs, botanicals, amino acids, and “other dietary substances for human use to supplement the diet.” The act specifically states that, unlike pharmaceutical preparations, dietary supplements can be marketed without proven safety or efficacy. Thus, it is the responsibility of the FDA to ensure safety. Rather than requiring manufacturers to perform extensive tests to prove safety or efficacy, the DSHEA basically means that the FDA must demonstrate that a supplement is unsafe. Thus, the FDA can restrict the sale of an herbal product only if well-documented health problems have occurred.\n\n【20】Furthermore, for the first time, the DSHEA allowed herbal preparations to have suggested dosages on the label. Before the DSHEA, herbal preparations could not suggest a dosage without the risk of being classified as a drug and being subjected to the tighter regulatory oversight that is associated with drugs.\n\n【21】The DSHEA prevents manufacturers from making specific medical claims (ie, saw palmetto reduces the frequency of urination). However, the act allows descriptions of the herb's effect on “structure or function” of the body. Thus, a claim that saw palmetto promotes healthy prostate functioning is acceptable. The distinction between medical claims and structure or function claims is often a fine line, and many manufacturers have tested the limits of this restriction. Recently, claims made by herbal manufacturers have come under greater scrutiny, and some penalties have been levied against manufacturers whose claims were deemed medical. Interestingly, the DSHEA mandates that the following disclaimer be present on each product label, “This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” However, much like warnings on cigarette packages, this disclaimer seems to be relatively unnoticed by most consumers. A common misperception is that, because the herb is in a sealed plastic container on a shelf next to other products, such as overthe-counter drugs that are FDA approved, herbs must also be FDA approved.\n\n【22】In this regulatory environment, US herbs should be viewed as a “buyer beware” situation. With limited regulatory oversight, herbs in the United States have no guarantee on quality, batch-to–batch variability, or even identity of products being sold. There are well-documented cases of inaccurate labeling, intentional substitution, etc, which truly create a caveat emptor situation.\n\n【23】PURITY OF HERBS\n---------------\n\n【24】The DSHEA gives the FDA authority to establish good manufacturing practice regulations regarding the preparation, packaging, and storage of dietary supplements under conditions that would ensure their safety. Some manufacturing groups have begun implementing voluntary standards and policing efforts. At this time, however, there is still no formal regulatory oversight to ensure that all dietary supplement manufacturers adhere to good manufacturing practices.\n\n【25】UNITED STATES PHARMACOPEIA DESIGNATION\n--------------------------------------\n\n【26】The United States Pharmacopeia (USP)\n\n【27】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【28】*   US Pharmacopeia\n\n【29】is a not-forprofit private organization that sets the standards man ufacturers must fulfill to sell their drugs in the United States. The USP has also established standards for botanical and nonbotanical dietary supplements.\n\n【30】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【31】*   US Pharmacopeia\n\n【32】Dietary supplements may carry the USP symbol if they comply with the appropriate standards and if the supplement has an FDA-approved or USP-accepted use. Thus, consumers who purchase a product that carries the USP symbol are ensured that the supplement fulfills USP standards for identity, strength, quality, purity, packaging, and labeling.\n\n【33】Since most herbal products are sold as dietary supplements (and hence do not have FDA-approved uses), most will not qualify for a USP designation. However, a substance that does not have FDA approval or a USP-accepted use but has been used extensively with no documented adverse safety risks may carry the National Formulary (NF) symbol. Thus, an herbal product that carries the NF designation fulfills the quality standards set by the USP but does not carry FDA or USP endorsement regarding its intended use.\n\n【34】PATIENT INTEREST IN HERBAL MEDICINE\n-----------------------------------\n\n【35】There are many theories to account for the rapid increase in the use of herbal products in the United States during the past 20 years. Some cite the political and social upheaval of the 1960s and the subsequent reemphasis on “back-toearth” philosophies. Others point to a growing disenchantment with pharmaceutical medications. In the early 1900s, herbs and herbal preparations constituted a substantial portion of the pharmacopeia of the United States. Many pharmaceuticals in common use today had their origins in herbal preparations (aspirin from willow bark, digitalis from foxglove, etc). However, because of the lack of standardization and the variability of potency of preparations, safe and reproducible results were difficult to achieve. Hence, purified and standardized preparations became more prevalent, helping to initiate the growth of the pharmaceutical industry. By the mid–1900s, numerous serious illnesses were being effectively treated with pharmaceutical medications (eg, antibiotics). This led to an expectation that eventually all illnesses would be conquered with pharmaceuticals. Modem medicine, while amazingly successful in some areas, has not been particularly effective in eradicating many chronic diseases (eg, hypertension, arthritis, dementia, etc). Disenchantment with the unfulfilled promises of the pharmaceutical preparations has led many people to look for alternatives, including those within the herbal realm.\n\n【36】Awareness of herbs has also been facilitated by the proliferation of home computers and the explosive growth of the Internet, which have provided ready access to information about herbs. Ordering supplies of botanical products from around the world is usually an easy process.\n\n【37】The establishment of the Office of Alternative Medicine (by congressional mandate in 1992), which has now become the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), was in response to growing public demand for information on complementary and alternative medicine. Now, in 2000, with a budget of almost $70 million, the NCCAM is increasing patient awareness of complementary and alternative medicine in general and herbal therapy in particular. This is occurring as patients hear about large clinical trials and grants via press coverage. The NCCAM Web site is also frequently visited by consumers looking for reliable information.\n\n【38】The public has recently been inundated with reports of adverse outcomes from pharmaceutical medications. Statistics are cited on the evening news and front pages of newspapers, suggesting a high rate of mortality in US hospitals due to pharmaceutical misfortunes. Adding further to the public's disillusionment with pharmaceutical medications is the perception that many are prohibitively expensive. Thus, patients seeking alternatives have been attracted to herbs and herbal preparations. Herbs are generally viewed as “natural” and therefore gentler and safer than pharmaceuticals. Promoters of herbal medicine emphasize the role of herbs in preventing disease or restoring health, often implying that traditional medicine or pharmaceutical medicines treat disease whereas herbs are often viewed as promoting health.\n\n【39】Another major factor has been the move from a paternalistic form of medical practice to one in which patients often wish to be viewed as collaborators in their health care. Having access to herbs allows patients to self medicate and thereby control more of their health care decisions.\n\n【40】CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING HERBAL STUDIES\n--------------------------------------\n\n【41】When one considers the billions of dollars spent worldwide on various herbal medicines, it would seem reasonable to expect that a great deal of scientific literature is available to support herbal medicines. Unfortunately, rigorous scientific data are rarely available. While many herbs have been studied, frequently in European trials, the quality of the data is often suspect. Some studies have been faulted because pharmaceutical companies or herbal manufacturers have sponsored them. Many of the studies have a small number of subjects or are of brief duration. Still other studies are not available in English translation.\n\n【42】When the limitations of these studies are recognized and compared to the usual studies and documentation required to bring a new pharmaceutical to the US market, physicians understandably become hesitant to embrace herbal therapies. The average cost to bring a new medication to the US market has been estimated at $350 million, reflecting the huge investment in research, regulatory hurdles, etc. However, because most herbs are not patentable, there is little incentive for a manufacturer to pursue such a rigorous scientific undertaking. Fostering research is critical since such studies would confirm the efficacy of some compounds while revealing the lack of efficacy or even toxicity of others. Once the “wheat is separated from the chaff,” identification of active ingredients in efficacious herbs might reasonably yield even safer and more purified forms. Such scientific scrutiny should help society weigh the costs and benefits of currently popular herbs, leading to more appropriate use and greater safety.\n\n【43】Supporters of herbal medicine counter that such extensive studies are not needed. They point to the historical use of certain herbs over many centuries (eg, in Europe and Asia) as a good indication that herbs are not only effective but also safe. Hence, expensive evidence-based studies are viewed as unnecessary.\n\n【44】Herbal detractors counter with recent reports of adverse effects of classically used preparations (eg, bleeding episodes after gingko use.\n\n【45】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【46】Association of _Ginkgo hiloba_ with intracerebral hemorrhage \\[lelter\\].\n\n【47】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【48】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【49】Spontaneous hyphema associated with ingestion of _Ginkgo biloba_ extract \\[letterl.\n\n【50】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【51】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【52】Spontaneous bilateral subdural hematomas associated with chronic _Ginkgo biloba_ ingestion.\n\n【53】interactions of St John's wort with prescription medications\n\n【54】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【55】Indinavir concentrations and St John's wort \\[letterl.\n\n【56】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【57】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【58】Pharmacokinctic interaction of digoxin with an herbal extract from St John's wort.\n\n【59】). Acute rejection in 2 heart transplant patients due to a metabolic interaction of St John's wort and cyclosporine has been reported.\n\n【60】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【61】Acute heart transplant rejection due to Saint John's wort \\[letter\\].\n\n【62】Herbal detractors point out that these adverse effects or interactions were not identified or discovered by simple reliance on historical use information. Scientifically rigorous placebo-controlled trials with adequate numbers of subjects followed up for extended periods are needed to ensure not only efficacy but also safety of herbal preparations.\n\n【63】Thus, tension persists between herbal supporters (who believe that available information is adequate to justify use) and herbal detractors (who believe that herbal medicines should undergo the same degree of scrutiny that pharmaceutical medications currently undergo). Because it is unlikely that the herbal industry will invest substantial funds to investigate products that are already multimilliondollar sellers, the resolution to this tension will likely be the province of nationally funded studies. The NCCAM and the Office of Dietary Supplements (ODS) are currently funding such studies. Performed primarily by academic centers, this small but growing body of literature should bring scientifically valid information to the arena of herbal therapy.\n\n【64】EUROPEAN PHYSICIANS' VIEW OF HERBS\n----------------------------------\n\n【65】Of importance, many of the positive comments regarding the use of herbal supplements have been from the European experience. In Germany, herbal medicines are standardized, frequently prescribed by physicians, and generally covered by insurance. This standardization makes the reliability of obtaining the same amount of an active ingredient from a given preparation over time highly likely. Because of this standardization, along with greater experience over many years, European physicians have generally taken a more favorable tone regarding the use of herbs. This increased comfort with herbal preparations is also demonstrated by the much greater per capita expenditure for herbal medicine in the European countries.\n\n【66】RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USING HERBAL THERAPIES\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【67】Because many herbs are collected from various sources worldwide, the collector may or may not have specific education in discerning a beneficial plant from a similar appearing but dangerous plant. Foxglove being substituted for plantain has led to digitalis poisoning in one well documented instance.\n\n【68】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【69】Contamination of botanical dietary supplements by _Digitalis lanata_ .\n\n【70】There are numerous cases of intentional substitution of herbs (eg, mandrake for ginseng) with subsequent toxicity. There is also concern that some traditional medicines actually include heavy metals, such as lead,\n\n【71】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【72】Indian herbal remedies for diabetes as a cause of lead poisoning.\n\n【73】as an active ingredient (eg, ayurvedic preparations for diabetes, Mexican preparations for infant colic). Other documented cases have shown the presence of corticosteroids and anti-inflammatory drugs in “natural” preparations touted as being beneficial for rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【74】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【75】Chinese “herbal medicine” mail order syndrome-a cause of hypercortisonism (abstract 1.\n\n【76】Cases of liver toxicity, especially from herbs containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids (eg, comfrey\n\n【77】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【78】Toxicity of comfrey.\n\n【79】), are also described frequently in the literature. The “Chinese herb nephropathy” is a well-published phenomenon\n\n【80】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【81】Rapidly progressive interstitial renal fibrosis in young women: association with slimming regimen including Chinese herbs.\n\n【82】that occurred in many female patients attending a weight loss center where misidentified Chinese herbs were used. Several of these patients eventually required dialysis and renal transplantation.\n\n【83】Finally, greater appreciation for the potential interactions between herbs and pharmaceutical drugs is growing.\n\n【84】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【85】Herbal medicinals: selected clinical considerations focusing on known or potential drug-herb interactions.\n\n【86】In addition to the examples cited earlier, studies have indicated that St John's wort may inhibit the bioavailability of certain antiretroviral agents. Possible interactions with anesthetic agents during surgery from central nervous system-active herbs (eg, valerian and kava) are a growing concern. Careful preoperative screening should include specific inquiry about the use of herbs or other dietary supplements. Discontinuation of supplements at least 1 week before surgery is a prudent strategy, at least until more information is available.\n\n【87】LEGAL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HERBAL THERAPY\n------------------------------------------\n\n【88】Literature is evolving regarding legal risks to physicians who refer patients for alternative therapies, including herbal therapies. Referring a patient to an herbalist or naturopath may engender some risk of liability if that practitioner subsequently injures the patient. This is especially likely if the referring physician maintains some supervisory role in the care provided by the other practitioner. Even recommending a trial of an herbal product to a patient may imply some risk since the quality and purity of the substance that the patient will be purchasing may be suspect under the current regulatory status in the United States.\n\n【89】With the growing number of reports in the medical literature of the high use of herbal supplements by patients (studies suggest that between 40% and 60% of patients are using dietary supplements), physicians must carefully inquire about herbal or dietary supplement use from each patient. Failure to ask may result in under recognition of toxicity of preparations that patients are using, as well as herb-herb interactions or drug-herb interactions. A discussion with patients regarding the use of herbal supplements should include a careful explanation of the current regulatory status and the possible lack of satisfactory good manufacturing practices. Most herbs have not been studied adequately in children or in pregnant women. Thus, it is prudent to counsel against use in these populations.\n\n【90】REFERENCES ON SPECIFIC HERBAL THERAPIES\n---------------------------------------\n\n【91】Many patients and physicians have heard of the _Therapeu tic Guide to Herbal Medicines: Complete German Commission E Monographs_ ,\n\n【92】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【93】Blumenthal M Therapeutic Guide to Herbal Medicines: Complete German Commission E Monographs.

However, reliable information can be obtained from the NCCAM site ( nccarn.nih.gov ) or from the ODS site ( odp.od.nih.gov/ods/default.html ). The FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition also has a section dealing with dietary supplements ( vm.cfsan.fda.gov/list.html ).\n\n【114】While somewhat “pro” –herb, the American Botanical Council maintains a Web site  that is well organized and contains many links that consumers are likely to use.\n\n【115】DISCUSSIONS WITH PATIENTS ABOUT HERBAL THERAPIES\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【116】Physicians must keep an open dialogue with patients who are taking or contemplating taking herbal medicine. Discussing the use of herbal medicine nonjudgmentally provides an opportunity for shared discussion about the risks and benefits. For patients who are planning to take herbal medicines, it has been suggested that they seek products whose labeling includes the product's scientific name, which parts of the plant are used, the name and address of the manufacturer, batch and lot numbers, and dates of manufacture and expiration. All this information does not guarantee the quality or even the identity of the parts contained therein, but it does suggest some attempt at integrity and labeling. Looking for the USP or NF symbol may also be important in finding quality products.\n\n【117】Physicians must educate patients about the nature of herbs. Herbs have effects, both good and adverse, because they contain active chemical compounds and thus are not inherently more or less toxic than synthetic compounds or “chemicals.” Whether a substance is organic or inorganic, synthesized in vitro or in vivo, by plant or by a manufacturer, the laws of biochemistry and receptor modulation apply. Starting with this basic understanding may help patients more fully appreciate the concerns and reticence many physicians have in regard to herbal therapies.\n\n【118】In an editorial in the _Annals of Internal Medicine,_ Delbanco\n\n【119】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【120】Bitter herbs: mainstream, magic, and menace \\[editorial).\n\n【121】made several points about the approach physicians should use in dealing with patients and alternative therapies. Four are particularly germane to herbal therapy.\n\n【122】*   1.\n\n【123】    _Remain humble about our own mixture of art and science._ Clearly, there are procedures we do within the confines of traditional medicine that have scant scientific backing and perhaps are used primarily on the basis of tradition.\n\n【124】*   2.\n\n【125】    _Learn more about alternative therapies so that we can have open discussions with our patients._ Learning more about alternative therapies does not imply acceptance or promotion but does indicate our willingness to discuss these issues objectively with our patients.\n\n【126】*   3.\n\n【127】    _Apply our rich scientific heritage to test alternative therapies._ This is being done on some levels now through the auspices of the NCCAM, the ODS, and several academic institutions.\n\n【128】*   4.\n\n【129】    _Maintain open communication with our patients._\n\n【130】Clearly, this is the most important message when talking to patients who may be taking herbal supplements. Dismissing the use of such preparations or in some way implying a lack of respect for people who choose to use these medications simply forecloses the possibility of any further dialogue, the possibility for education, and the pos– sibility for preventing harm or otherwise benefiting our patients.\n\n【131】Physicians and patients should increasingly be able to explore the realm of herbal therapies in collaboration. As results of studies that are currently under way become available, opportunities to share the findings with patients will increase. These educational efforts will be critical in developing a rational and safe approach to the use of herbal therapies in the United States.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Participants were asked to estimate their stroke risk without OAC and bleeding risk with OAC using a quantitative risk scale. The reported values were compared with subjectively estimated risks derived from the CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc and HAS-BLED scores. Similarly, we compared patient perception of the stroke risk reduction afforded with OAC compared with what is reported in the literature.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 227 patients were included in the analysis. The mean ± SD CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score was 4.3±1.6, and HAS-BLED score was 2.3±1.2. Atrial fibrillation was paroxysmal in 53.3% and persistent/permanent in 46.7%. There was a negligible correlation between patient perceived and estimated risk of stroke ( _r_ \\=0.07; _P_ \\=.32), and bleeding ( _r_ \\=0.16; _P_ \\=.02). Most patients overestimated their risks of stroke and bleeding: 120 patients (52.9%) perceived an annual stroke risk greater than 20%, and 115 (53.5%) perceived an annual bleeding risk with OAC greater than 10%. Most patients (n=204; 89.9%) perceived that OAC would reduce their annual stroke risk by at least 50%.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Perceived risks of stroke and bleeding are markedly overestimated in most patients with AF. Further research is needed to discern the root causes and to identify effective methods of bridging this alarming disparity.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【10】AF ( atrial fibrillation ), INR ( international normalized ratio ), OAC ( oral anticoagulation ), TIA ( transient ischemic attack )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Institutions and study sponsors implemented several modifications to overcome these challenges.\n\n【48】At Mayo Clinic, before the pandemic, most research studies documented informed consent in person and via hard copy. Likewise, a majority of study visits were conducted in person. The aims of this study were to compare the use of electronic consent, virtual (telemedicine and video) visits, and virtual monitoring of trials by study monitors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Anecdotally, we recognize that several institutions have implemented similar measures. However, to our knowledge, there are no data comparing the use of these approaches before and since the pandemic.\n\n【49】Methods\n-------\n\n【50】### Environment\n\n【51】Clinical research is a basic tenet at Mayo Clinic. Research is conducted at main campuses in Rochester, Minnesota; Scottsdale and Phoenix, Arizona; and Jacksonville, Florida, and the Mayo Clinic Health System (in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa). All campuses use an integrated electronic health record (EHR) system (Epic, Verona, Wisconsin) for clinical practice and research. The Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB) serves as the IRB of record for more than 95% of studies conducted at Mayo Clinic. For the remainder, an external IRB serves as the IRB of record.\n\n【52】### Study Design\n\n【53】This study covered the period from March 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020. Several measures were implemented to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical trials at Mayo Clinic. This study evaluated the effects and the resultant adaptations of the pandemic on the use of electronic consent, remote patient visits, and remote study monitor visits. These metrics were compared before and after the onset of the pandemic and implementation of COVID restrictions on the conduct of research at Mayo Clinic that were initially implemented on March 18, 2020: that is, before stay-at-home orders issued by the state government in Minnesota (March 27, 2020), Arizona (March 31, 2020), and Florida (April 3, 2020). To standardize data analysis across all 3 primary Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona, Florida, and Minnesota with varying stay-at-home orders, the same cutoff date (March 1, 2020) was used to compare pre– and post–COVID-19 data.\n\n【54】### Informed Consent\n\n【55】Participants consent to participate in clinical research through the Participant Tracking System (PTrax) application (Mayo Clinic).\n\n【56】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【57】Transforming the activation of clinical trials.\n\n【58】The consent form is automatically sent into the patient EHR. PTrax enables the study team members the ability to track the status of all participants in real time. The status identifies the stage of participation in the study life cycle. Arranged in chronologic order, the main statuses are enrolled (ie, after informed consent but before screening tests), accrued (ie, after screening tests have been completed), completed (ie, all study-related activities have been completed), and withdrawn. The accrued status is further categorized as active intervention (ie, after the primary intervention has commenced) and long-term follow-up (ie, after study-related treatments and procedures are completed and patients are under follow-up).\n\n【59】All participants are provided with a hard copy of the consent form. Electronic consent requires a device (eg, tablet) and a conversation, either in the physical presence (ie, for on-site, in-person consent) or remotely (through video or telephone) between the person authorized to obtain consent or assent or Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization from the potential participant. Neither the electronic consent nor the remote consent option is routinely granted when studies are approved by the IRB unless the study team requests permission from the IRB to use these options. Once approved, consent forms can be shared electronically with participants. The process is facilitated by integration between PTrax and DocuSign (DocuSign, San Francisco, CA). Participants can consent by clicking the link, reviewing each page, and marking their signatures.\n\n【60】The electronic option, which was introduced in December 2013, has evolved over time. Between December 2013, and August 2019, it was only used to consent participants on site. In August 2019, the IRB approved remote electronic consenting, which is accomplished with an e-mail link also facilitated by DocuSign. An enhancement introduced in April 2021, allows both the participant and the person obtaining consent to electronically sign the consent form. PTrax keeps track of whether participants were consented on site or remotely.\n\n【61】### Data Analysis\n\n【62】PTrax was used to compute the number of new participants consented to every research study by hard copy and electronic means. During the COVID-19 pandemic, some participants were reconsented because of a change in study procedures because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Hence, only participants who were initially consented to a study were considered for this analysis. A few participants may participate in 2 or more studies. Therefore, the data are summarized as the number of consents rather than the number of participants. Since the remote electronic consent option was introduced in August 2019, we allowed 2 months (August and September 2019) for study teams to familiarize themselves with the external electronic-consent option. Hence, for this analysis, the pre-COVID period was between October 1, 2019, and February 28, 2020, and the postperiod was between March 1, 2020, and July 31, 2020.\n\n【63】### Study Visits\n\n【64】When feasible, some in-person study-related visits were replaced with telephone or video visits after the pandemic began. During video visits, patients connect to their providers or care teams through a HIPAA-compliant video connection enabled through patient-specific online portal to medical services. The metrics for virtual visits were available and analyzed from July 2019, to December 2020. Pre- and during-COVID data were analyzed, respectively, between July 1, 2019, and February 28, 2020, and between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020.\n\n【65】### Remote Study Monitor Visits\n\n【66】In April 2019, Mayo Clinic implemented the EpicCare Link application (Epic, Verona Wisconsin), which is compliant with 21 CFR Part 11 and allows study monitors to review the EHRs of study participants and verify compliance with the protocol. Study monitors also received access to other relevant documents such as source documentation that is housed in the EHR, via a secure file sharing solution, Microsoft SharePoint (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA). We analyzed the number of requests for remote study monitor visits over 10 months before (between May 1, 2019, and February 28, 2020) and 10 months after March 1, 2020 (between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020). When these data were analyzed, the number of study and patient records released in the Epic EHR for remote inspection were only available between September and December 2020 because earlier records had been purged from the system.\n\n【67】### Statistical Analysis\n\n【68】Data for electronic consent were summarized as the number of consented participants for all studies—non-trials and trials—and the proportions consented on site and remotely. The number of remote participant visits and requests for remote study monitor visits were also analyzed before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. For all variables, pre- vs post-COVID periods were analyzed by evaluating point estimates (eg, just before \\[February 2020\\] vs during the pandemic \\[December 2020\\]) and by comparing monthly averages with 2-sample _t_ \\-tests. These variables were averaged every month and then across the pre- and during-COVID periods. Data are summarized as mean (SD). Statistical analysis was performed with Microsoft Excel.\n\n【69】Results\n-------\n\n【70】At the beginning (May 2019) and end (December 2020) of this study period, there were 1492 and 1995 studies, respectively, with active participants on a research study. The number of studies with active participants increased from an average of 1642 (103) studies during the pre-COVID period (May 2019 to February 2020) to 1869 (68) studies per month ( _P_ <.001) during the COVID period (March to December 2020) .

In December 2020, the corresponding proportion had increased to 6463 of 9446 consents (68%). Between the pre- (May 2019 to February 2020) and during-COVID periods (March to December 2020), the proportion of patients who were electronically consented increased from 22 (2)% to 45 (20)% ( _P_ \\=.001).\n\n【78】Figure 2 Temporal trends in electronic consenting for clinical research studies between May 2019, and December 2020. Digital consents include on-site and remote digital consents. The difference between all and digital new consents represents the number of hard-copy consents.\n\n【79】Electronic consent took place on site or remotely. In February 2020, 1214 (23%) and 86 (2%) of all 5248 consents were executed electronically on site and remotely, respectively . In December 2020, the corresponding numbers were 1223 (13%) and 5297 (56%) of 9446 participants. Averaged over the entire pre- (May 2019 to February 2020) and post-COVID epochs (March to December 2020), the proportion of remote electronic consents increased from 0.3 (0.5%) to 29 (21%) ( _P_ <.001).\n\n【80】### Comparison of On-Site vs Remote Electronic Consent in Clinical Trials and Non-Trials\n\n【81】Among participants in a non-trial, the proportion who were electronically consented increased from 24% in the pre-COVID period (October 2019 to February 2020) to 59% in the during-COVID period (March to December 2020) ( _P_ \\=.001). Among clinical trial participants, the proportion who were electronically consented nearly doubled from 13% in the pre- (October 2019 to February 2020) to 28% in the during-COVID period (March to December 2020) ( _P_ \\=.01). The use of electronic consent increased to a greater extent in non-trials (25 \\[19\\]%) than clinical trials (11 \\[9%\\]) ( _P_ \\=.055). The proportion of participants who were electronically consented remotely increased from 0.4 (0.7%) to 32 (22%) ( _P_ \\=.0002) in non-trials and from 0.0 to 8 (5%) in clinical trials ( _P_ <.01). For remote consent, the pre- and during-COVID periods were between October 2019 and February 2020 and March and July 2020, respectively.\n\n【82】Table 2 categorizes the overall and electronic consent into minimal- and greater than minimal- risk studies. Because Table 2 provides overall counts for the pre- and during-COVID periods, it does not depict the initial drop in counts between February and April 2020. However, the statistical analysis compared the per-month counts across pre- and during-COVID periods, each lasting 10 months. Among minimal-risk trials and non-trials, the number of all consents declined, respectively, by 35% ( _P_ \\=.02) and 25% ( _P_ \\=.04). By contrast, among greater than minimal-risk trials, the number of all consents increased by 131% ( _P_ \\=.04). The number and proportion of electronic consents, expressed as a proportion of all consents, increased for all study types except for minimal-risk clinical trials ( _P_ ≤.03).\n\n【83】Table 2 Comparison of All and Electronic Consents Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\n| Period | ConsentsaValues are 10 month averages each pre- (May 2019 to February 2020) and during-COVID period (March to December 2020). |\n| --- | --- |\n| Non-trial | Clinical trial | Non-trial | Clinical trial |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Minimal risk | Greater than minimal risk | Minimal risk | Greater than minimal risk | Minimal risk | Greater than minimal risk | Minimal risk | Greater than minimal risk |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| All, No. | All, No. | All, No. | All, No. | Electronic, No. (%)bExpressed as a proportion of all studies in this category. | Electronic, No. (%)bExpressed as a proportion of all studies in this category. | Electronic, No. (%)bExpressed as a proportion of all studies in this category. | Electronic, No. (%) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Pre-COVID | 35,532 | 11,831 | 3139 | 8283 | 8489 (24) | 2025 (17) | 498 (16) | 988 (12) |\n| During COVID | 26,691 | 27,279 | 2054 | 6887 | 11,169 (42) | 19,623 (72) | 449 (22) | 2049 (30) |\n| Change (%)c\\[During–Before\\]/Before)∗100. | –25 | 131 | –35 | –17 | 32 | 869 | –10 | 107 |\n| _P_ valuedTwo-sample t-test for actual values (all consents) or proportion of electronic (ie, electronic/overall) consents during pre- vs during COVID. | .04 | .04 | .02 | .13 | .03 | <.0001 | .09 | .01 |\n\n【85】a Values are 10 month averages each pre- (May 2019 to February 2020) and during-COVID period (March to December 2020).\n\n【86】b Expressed as a proportion of all studies in this category.\n\n【87】c \\[During–Before\\]/Before)∗100.\n\n【88】d Two-sample _t_ \\-test for actual values (all consents) or proportion of electronic (ie, electronic/overall) consents during pre- vs during COVID.\n\n【89】In December 2020, 2840 of 4428 (64%) of all consents for minimal risk and 3217 of 4115 (77%) of all consents for greater than minimal-risk non-trials were electronically recorded. However, in that same month, only 54 of 246 (22%) of all consents for minimal risk and 191 of 618 (33%) of all consents for greater than minimal-risk clinical trials were electronically recorded.\n\n【90】### Virtual Visits by Study Participants\n\n【91】In July 2019, only 3 patients had virtual research visits. In April 2020, 541 patients had 1 or more virtual research visits; thereafter, the numbers declined to 194 in December 2020 . The number of patients who had virtual visits increased from 3.5±2.4 per month to 172±135 per month between pre-COVID (July 2019 to February 2020) and during-COVID (March to December 2020) epochs ( _P_ \\=.003). A majority (1252 patients or 68%) of these virtual visits used telemedicine capabilities; the remainder were video-enabled visits.\n\n【92】### Remote Study Monitor Visits\n\n【93】Between May 2019 and February 2020, 44±17 study monitors requested access for remote monitoring visits . Between March and December 2020, this number increased to 111±74 study monitors per month ( _P_ \\=.10). The numbers varied considerably over time. For example, during the during-COVID period, the number of requests ranged from a low of 58 requests in December 2020 to a peak of 312 requests in August 2020.\n\n【94】Figure 3 Temporal trends in studies (left panel) and participants (right panel) with virtual visits between July 2019 and December 2020. Virtual visits include video and telemedicine visits.\n\n【95】Discussion\n----------\n\n【96】Although the impact of COVID-19 on clinical trials and the measures taken to mitigate this have been discussed, the data are limited.\n\n【97】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【98】The impact of COVID-19 on clinical trial execution at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\n\n【99】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【100】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【101】COVID-19, social justice, and clinical cancer research.\n\n【102】Among geographically diverse sites at a single academic medical center, the number of new patients who were consented to participate in research studies declined by approximately 80% between January and April 2020, which was when the stay-at-home order was initially implemented in Minnesota. By contrast with minimal-risk studies, which declined before vs during the COVID-19 periods, the number of consents for greater than minimal-risk trials increased over time, probably because the latter trials are more likely to provide therapeutic options for patients. In May 2020, the enrollment of new participants began to increase. By November 2020, the enrollment of new participants was double that in February 2020. This rebound was accompanied—and likely facilitated by—an increase in the proportion of new patients who were electronically consented to participate in the study.\n\n【103】The Mayo Clinic IRB introduced the on-site and remote electronic consent options in January December 2013 and August 2019, respectively. In February 2020, just before the pandemic, only 25% of all new participants were electronically consented to a research study; 24% and 1% of all participants were consented on site and remotely. By December 2020, 68% of all consents were electronically recorded, albeit more so in non-trials (72%) than in clinical trials (29%). There are 4 possible reasons for the greater use of the electronic consent option in non-trials than in clinical trials. First, compared with clinical trials, a greater proportion of non-trials are minimal-risk studies. The IRB permits nonvulnerable participants to be digitally consented to minimal risk studies by e-mail. A video or telemedicine conversation is optional. By contrast, video or telemedicine consent is generally necessary for greater than minimal-risk studies. For some complex greater than minimal-risk studies, an in-person discussion of the risks and benefits with a hard-copy consent form is preferable. Second, as the screening visit for greater than minimal-risk studies typically includes laboratory tests and other objective assessments, which are typically conducted on site, many studies may opt to consent such participants on site. Third, the person obtaining consent signature field was not uniform among participants. There were differences among sponsors and, depending on the circumstances, in which participants were consented. These differences complicated the workflow and logistics. The April 2021 enhancement to PTrax has simplified the signature process for the person obtaining consent. Finally, it is conceivable that some study teams are not familiar with the remote consent option or have not processed the IRB modifications necessary to enable electronic consent. Indeed, in December 2020, only 22% and 31% of all consents to minimal-risk and greater than minimal-risk clinical trials were electronically recorded. Hence, there is scope to expand the use of electronic consenting in studies. When appropriately implemented, the expansion of electronic consent is 1 of several solutions that might facilitate the inclusion of diverse populations—including those who reside far away from medical centers—in clinical trials.\n\n【104】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【105】Jones Buie JN, Voeks JH. Impact of COVID-19 on clinical research and inclusion of diverse populations.\n\n【106】Aided by guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration and National Cancer Institute, study teams used virtual visits when safe and feasible to continue protocol-related activities and obviate deviations.\n\n【107】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【108】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【109】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【110】NIH Staff  \nGuidance for NIH-funded clinical trials and human subjects studies affected by COVID-19.\n\n【111】National Institutes of Health , Bethesda, MD 2020\n\n【112】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【113】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【114】Additional guidance regarding alternative procedures for clinical trials supported by the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) affected by the spread of the novel coronavirus: memorandum.\n\n【115】National Institutes of Health , Bethesda, MD 2020\n\n【116】The number of virtual (telemedicine and video) visits increased from 11 per month in February, to a peak of 607 per month in April 2020. Concurrent with the relaxation in stay-at-home orders in Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona, the number of virtual visits declined to 142 per month in November 2020. Research video visits are conducted with a secure video system and must be scheduled on appointment calendars. Hence, the data for research video visits are accurate.\n\n【117】Some applications (eg, electronic consent and remote-study monitoring) that mitigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were even available before the pandemic. The use of video visits, which were introduced 1 week after the pandemic began, rapidly increased thereafter, similar to the rapid growth in video visits for clinical care.\n\n【118】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【119】Qualitative assessment of rapid system transformation to primary care video visits at an academic medical center.\n\n【120】Concurrent with the relaxation in stay-at-home guidelines, the number of telemedicine, and—to a lesser extent—video visits has declined since the peak in April 2020, perhaps partly because study teams have strived to adhere to the original study protocol. However, these virtual visits have not reverted to pre–COVID-19 levels, probably because many participants prefer the convenience, reduced expense, and increased safety of virtual visits (ie, they avoid the risk of contracting COVID-19 while traveling to medical centers). By bringing clinical trials closer to patients, virtual visits may enhance access to clinical trials, especially for minority and underserved communities that have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic.\n\n【121】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【122】COVID-19, social justice, and clinical cancer research.\n\n【123】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【124】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【125】Even before the pandemic, the financial burden of participating in clinical trials was highest for patients living in low-income areas or enrolled in National Institutes of Health-sponsored trials and phase 1 studies.\n\n【126】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【127】At what cost to clinical trial enrollment?

However, this change was not significant. At present, virtually all study monitor visits are conducted remotely. In addition to saving time and travel expenses for study monitors, remote monitoring also saves study staff the expense of chaperoning monitors during visits. In addition to remote monitoring, site-initiation visits are also largely conducted remotely.\n\n【144】In addition to these measures, study teams were provided detailed guidance on measures to facilitate work from home, conducting meetings with an online meeting platform, reporting requirements, scheduling video and telephone appointments, arranging for remote laboratory testing, and shipping medications to patients. Study protocol deviations were documented with an Epic script that had prefilled dropdown options in the patients' EHRs. These and other measures were widely disseminated among study teams. The IRB stipulated that research participants did not have to be reconsented during the pandemic unless the changes to the research are such that the original consent is no longer valid, which would require a modification to be submitted and approved by the IRB. Participants were notified of changes to the research via a letter or other form of communication (e-mail, telephone, virtual meeting). Investigators were not required to report these changes to the IRB unless the form of communication was a permanent change to the consent process.\n\n【145】### Limitations\n\n【146】Because some participants—likely few—may have participated in more than 1 study, the counts are summarized as the number of consents rather than the number of participants. The number of telemedicine visits is likely an underestimate because not all such visits are scheduled on appointment calendars. Data for remote monitor visits were limited because the data were purged from the system before we undertook this review.\n\n【147】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【148】COVID-19 disrupted the status quo in clinical research and provided a catalyst to hasten the adoption of electronic and other solutions for clinical trials. Sustained in the long term, these solutions may foster participation in clinical trials and reduce participant burden, thereby increasing recruitment and retention to trials.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The most common operations performed were mitral valve repair (26%) and aortic valve replacement (22%). Over the 5-year period, 41 % of patients had IOTEE. New information was found before bypass in 15% of patients, directly affecting surgery in 14% of the patients. The most common new prebypass information found was patent foramen ovale resulting in closure in the majority of patients. New information was found after bypass in 6% of the patients, resulting in a change in surgery or hemodynamic management in 4% of the total. The most common postbypass finding was valvular dysfunction with repeat bypass in most patients for re-repair or replacement.

He was undergoing 3-times-weekly hemodialysis and was being treated for secondary hyperparathyroidism with sevelamer, vitamin D analogs, and cinacalcet for the past few years. On inspection, he was short statured, measuring 4 feet and 5 inches in height, his rib cage was deformed, and he had bulbous fingertips with shortened distal phalanges on both hands. Laboratory results revealed a serum-intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 2408 pg/mL (reference range 8.7 to 77.1), calcium 7.7 mg/dL, phosphorus 5.5 mg/dL, and albumin 3.2 mg/dL. Blood cultures from the periphery and hemodialysis catheter grew coagulase-negative staphylococcus bacteria.\n\n【1】Chest imaging showed expansile bone lesions consistent with Brown tumors from longstanding uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism, and he had multiple fractures of varying ages involving thoracic vertebrae, sternum, bilateral scapulae, and ribs; as a result, he developed a striking chest deformity .

However, a year later, he underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy, following which his serum-intact PTH level declined to less than 150 pg/mL. His bony deformities persisted, but fortunately, the patient did not develop spinal-cord compression or distressing breathing problems.\n\n【5】The term _renal osteodystrophy_ encompasses a variety of bone disorders caused by chronic renal failure.

In patients with ESRD and chronic hemodialysis, maintenance of serum PTH levels between 150 and 300 pg/mL is considered adequate.

We agree with Gersh that discontinuation of antihypertensive drugs angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in the management of hypertension (HTN) is unjustified at this moment because of the lack of evidence for negative effects of these drugs in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, in recent weeks, several important articles have been published, shedding new light in reference to the potential interplay of ACEIs and ARBs with COVID-19.\n\n【1】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, penetrates the cells primarily through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its natural receptor at the cell surface. Whether ACEI and ARB administration would increase ACE2 levels or expression remains mostly speculative, as does whether increased ACE2 expression is beneficial or detrimental in COVID-19. As noted by Gersh, Diaz\n\n【2】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【3】Hypothesis: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers may increase the risk of severe COVID-19.\n\n【4】argued that as ACE2 levels increase after the intravenous infusion of ACEIs and ARBs in animal models, taking ACEIs or ARBs may aggravate the infection severity in patients with COVID-19. However, not all studies conducted in animals clearly reported increased ACE2 levels in response to ACEI/ARB administration.\n\n【5】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【6】Myocardial infarction increases ACE2 expression in rat and humans.\n\n【7】Importantly, investigations analyzing changes in plasma or tissue ACE2 levels in humans are limited. In fact, 2 studies\n\n【8】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【9】Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 activity and human atrial fibrillation: increased plasma angiotensin converting enzyme 2 activity is associated with atrial fibrillation and more advanced left atrial structural remodelling.\n\n【10】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【11】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【12】Elevated plasma angiotensin converting enzyme 2 activity is an independent predictor of major adverse cardiac events in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease.\n\n【13】in patients with atrial fibrillation or coronary heart disease found no differences in plasma ACE2 levels between those taking ACEIs or ARBs and those not taking these medications. Nonetheless, plasma levels may not reflect tissue ACE2 expression, and vice versa, and this topic requires further investigation.\n\n【14】The role of ACE2 expression in COVID-19 morbidity and mortality is still unknown.

However, although a relatively high percentage of patients with COVID-19 hospitalized have HTN, the prevalence of HTN in adults is similar worldwide, increasing with age. In patients with COVID-19, the odds of disease severity with HTN was found, in meta-regression, to be associated with advancing age.\n\n【18】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【19】Hypertension and its severity or mortality in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): a pooled analysis \\[published online ahead of print March 31, 2002\\].\n\n【20】As Marin\n\n【21】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【22】Facts and reflections on COVID-19 and anti-hypertensives drugs.\n\n【23】has also stated, an epidemiological association simply based on the prevalence of HTN and ACEIs/ARBs in COVID-19 is inappropriate.

After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and in-hospital medications, the risk of all-cause mortality was still lower in the ACEI/ARB group than in the non-ACEI/ARB group (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.19 to 0.92; _P_ \\=.03). Their results also indicated a lower risk of COVID-19 mortality in patients who received ACEIs/ARBs than in those who did not (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.89; _P_ \\=.03) in a propensity score–matched analysis followed by adjusting imbalanced variables in mixed-effect Cox model. Moreover, compared with other antihypertensive drugs, ACEIs/ARBs were associated with lower mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.70; _P_ \\=.01) in COVID-19. Therefore, what can be reasonably concluded from the recently published large single and multicenter studies from multiple countries is that there is no significant risk of disease severity or mortality associated with ACEIs/ARBs, with some even suggesting potential benefits in patients with COIVD-19.\n\n【45】The mechanism behind any potential benefit of ACEIs and ARBs in COVID-19 is still enigmatic. Differences in inflammatory and immune biomarkers have been reported in patients with COVID-19 taking ACEIs and ARBs. Meng et al\n\n【46】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【47】Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors improve the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients with hypertension.\n\n【48】found a reduced rate of severe COVID-19 and lower levels of interleukin-6, increased CD3 and CD8 T cells in peripheral blood, and decreased peak viral loads compared with those using other antihypertensive medications. Moreover, Yang et al\n\n【49】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【50】Effects of ARBs and ACEIs on virus infection, inflammatory status and clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients with hypertension: a single center retrospective study \\[published online ahead of print April 29, 2020\\].\n\n【51】reported that patients with COVID-19 and HTN taking ACEI and ARBs had substantially lower C reactive protein and procalcitonin levels as well as a decreased rate of critical illness and death.\n\n【52】Angiotensin receptor blockers have also been found to be effective in treating patients with sepsis, pneumonia, and influenza. Moreover, a combination of statins and ARBs appeared to substantially reduce mortality during the recent Ebola outbreak.\n\n【53】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【54】Treating the host response to emerging virus diseases: lessons learned from sepsis, pneumonia, influenza and Ebola.\n\n【55】It has been suggested that higher doses of ARBs may protect patients with COVID-19 from acute lung injury (ALI) via 2 complementary mechanisms: (1) by blocking excessive angiotensin II binding, promoting vasoconstriction, inflammation, and oxidative damage, and (2) by up-regulating ACE2 and increasing angiotensin 1-7 production.\n\n【56】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【57】Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and anti-hypertensives (angiotensin receptor blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) \\[published online ahead of print April 4, 2020\\].\n\n【58】This warrants immediate further investigation. We hypothesize that ACEIs may not only attenuate the increase in angiotensin II but, via reduced endothelial dysfunction and decreased expression of tissue plasminogen activator 1 and increase tissue plasminogen activator levels due to decreased bradykinin breakdown, mitigate the reported COVID-19–associated coagulopathy, which may drive ALI and multiple organ dysfunction.\n\n【59】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【60】Hyperinflammation and derangement of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in COVID-19: a novel hypothesis for clinically suspected hypercoagulopathy and microvascular immunothrombosis.\n\n【61】As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the cardiovascular health of patients must not be neglected at the expense of the outbreak. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs improve outcomes and increase survival in multiple cardiovascular diseases. Although further investigation in prospective studies is warranted, based on the preponderance of current data and evidence, it is highly unlikely that the use of ACEIs/ARBs may be associated with increased severity or mortality risk. In summary, the newly reported data support current guidelines and health professional recommendations for the continuation of ACEIs/ARBs for treating HTN during the COVID-19 pandemic.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The organization was founded in 1971 in France and currently has an international network with sections in 18 countries. In 2001, Sweden issued 2 stamps (Scott No. 2418a) to honor the organization. The issuance of these stamps provides an opportunity to honor the founder of MSF, Bernard Kouchner.\n\n【1】Bernard Kouchner was born on November 1, 1939, in Avignon in southeastern France, about 50 miles northwest of Marseilles. He grew up in the suburbs of Paris, where his father was a physician. While growing up and being educated, Kouchner was influenced by the works of existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-1980) and poet Louis Aragon (1897-1982). In 1964, Kouchner received his MD degree and subsequently became certified as a gastroenterologist.\n\n【2】In 1967, Biafra, a region in eastern Nigeria, seceded from Nigeria and proclaimed its independence, which prompted a civil war in the region. With about 50 of his medical colleagues, Kouchner traveled to Biafra in the summer of 1968, where, as part of the International Red Cross, he tried to provide medical aid to the suffering population. When Kouchner returned to France in early 1969, he speculated on the problems of the conflict and voiced his disagreement with the International Red Cross and its policy of not interfering in the politics of the warring countries.\n\n【3】The civil war (and ensuing famine) in Biafra resulted in the founding of GIMCU (Groupe d'Intervention Medical et Chirurgical d'Urgence, or Emergency Medical and Surgical Intervention Group). A second disaster—a flood due to a tidal wave in eastern Pakistan (now Bangladesh)—led to the establishment of SMF (Secours Medical Français, or French Medical Relief). On December 20, 1971, MSF was born from the merger of GIMCU and SMF, with Kouchner as its first director. The MSF has essentially the same goals as the other 2 groups, that is, to bring food, medical supplies, and hope to the needy peoples of the world.\n\n【4】In late 1970, Kouchner cared for victims of an earthquake in Peru and the survivors of the Black September massacre of Palestinians in Jordan. He worked in Nicaragua (earthquake) in 1972, in Lebanon (civil war) and Vietnam (war) in 1975, and in Turkey (earthquake) in 1976.\n\n【5】Kouchner remained with MSF until 1979, when he left to form a new group, Médecins du Monde, or Doctors of the World. The goals of this group were essentially those of the previously mentioned organizations. The disagreement between Kouchner and MSF began with the Vietnamese refugee problem in 1979. Doctors of the World, founded in mid-1980, organized relief efforts in Afghanistan (civil war), Armenia (earthquake, 1988), Ethiopia (famine, late 1980s), Brazil (war with native Indians), and other Latin American countries (Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Mexico), as well as in Poland, Burma, and Mozambique.\n\n【6】After Kouchner left MSF in 1979, the organization became more international. The MSF movement was born in France but was enriched by the organization of Belgian and Swiss sections in 1981, a Dutch section in 1983, and Spanish and Luxembourgian sections in 1985. Between 1986 and 1995, this expansion continued with the creation of supporting sections in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\n\n【7】In about 1988, Kouchner began to be more political in his thinking than he had been earlier. He has served in several political posts in France, as France's first Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and later as French Minister of Health and has continued to exert pressure to allocate resources for the medical problems of needy populations throughout the world.\n\n【8】Kouchner has received many awards and honors, including the Dag Hammarskjold Award (1979), the Louise Weiss Prize of the European Parliament (1979), the Athinai Prize of the Alexander Onassis Foundation (1981), and the Prix Europe (1984).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Avicenna’s father, Abdullāh, was a government tax collector and carefully supervised his son’s education. The boy was an eager student who memorized the Quran by age 10, learned arithmetic from an Indian grocer, and studied Islamic jurisprudence and philosophy with prominent scholars.\n\n【1】By age 16, Avicenna was already considered a master of theology, philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy, but he then turned his attention to medicine and qualified as a physician at age 18. Early on in his clinical practice, he treated a local governor (an emir) for a serious illness and as a reward was given access to the royal library of the Samanids, which unfortunately burned down shortly thereafter. Despite Avicenna’s enemies blaming this fire on him, he soon acquired a wide reputation as an excellent physician.\n\n【2】When Avicenna was 22, his father died, and shortly thereafter the Samanid empire fell to two rival Persian and Turkic empires (in approximately 1004 CE) In the following years, Avicenna moved between present-day Iran, Afghanistan, and Tajikistan, his fortunes rising and falling, eventually settling in Rey (near present-day Teheran), where the great Persian physician, Razi, had practiced a century earlier. After 1024, he lived in the cities of Hamadān and Isfahan (both in present-day Iran) and served several emirs.\n\n【3】Avicenna was a prolific author. Because he wrote in Arabic, the lingua franca of the Islamic territories at that time, some later writers have erroneously described Avicenna as an “Arab physician.” Avicenna never stepped out of Persian territory, but was influential in medieval Europe, especially via his book _Al-Shifa_ (The Book of Healing) and his famous _Canon_ (“Ghanon” in Farsi), a one-million word comprehensive and systematic encyclopedia of medicine. Avicenna’s _Canon_ became a standard medical textbook in the medieval and early Renaissance period in Europe; and Avicenna was included in _Limbo in Inferno_ ─ by 14 <sup>th </sup> century Italian writer Dante Alighieri ─ together with various other virtuous non-Christian thinkers, including Socrates, Homer, Ovid, and Virgil.\n\n【4】Avicenna believed that anatomy is the cornerstone of medicine. He recognized nerves and tendons as separate structures, and advocated repairing cut nerves and tendons separately. He described the compartment syndrome after limb injuries, as well as compression neuropathies and neuroma formation after nerve injuries. He recommended ligation of bleeding arteries and hypothesized that arterial repair might one day be possible, though nearly 1000 years would pass before Alexis Carrel in France developed vascular suturing techniques at the beginning of the 20 <sup>th </sup> century.\n\n【5】Avicenna is also credited with describing thyroid-related orbitopathy and esophageal cancer, and with being the first physician to use a flexible catheter to relieve urinary retention and irrigate the bladder. However, despite a key plot element in the 1986 best-selling Noah Gordon historical fiction book _The Physician_ – made into an award-winning German film in 2013, in which actor Ben Kingsley starred as Ibn Sina – he did not discover the vermiform appendix.\n\n【6】Avicenna was a pioneer of what is now called “holistic medicine” and emphasized the role of the patient’s nutrition, spirit, emotional state, and environment in healing. In one famous anecdote, Avicenna diagnosed love-sickness in a patient. He examined the patient’s pulse and realized that the pulse fluttered whenever the patient heard the name of the district, street, and name of a girl he loved.\n\n【7】In approximately 1035 CE, at age 57, Avicenna died while travelling from Isfahan to Hamadan, Persia. His mausoleum is in Hamadan, Iran, and was rebuilt in 1952. Because of his achievements, Avicenna has been called by European physicians, “the prince of physicians.”\n\n【8】At least 26 countries in the Middle East, Africa, and Europe have honored Avicenna philatelically, some several times. Avicenna’s image is often used on postal stamps to commemorate scientific anniversaries and achievements. On March 5, 2013, for example, Iran issued a stamp (Scott #3083) that depicts Ibn Sina writing to commemorate the 1000 <sup>th </sup> anniversary of publication of the _Canon_ , and on August 22, 2004, Avicenna’s vignette appeared on an Iranian stamp issued on the occasion of International Avicenna Congress and Doctor’s Day (Scott # 2895, Figure).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

These articles are also featured on the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings'_ YouTube Channel .\n\n【1】M c Ardle's Sign as a Signature in Multiple Sclerosis\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【2】Ongoing advances in biochemical and genetic tests, biomarkers, and imaging, among other approaches, have steadily improved sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing disease. Nonetheless, the proximate and critical step in delineating an underlying disease remains the history and physical examination (H&P); indeed, the H&P provided the major, if not only, diagnostic approach before the burgeoning diagnostic advances in medicine during the last 100 or so years. Moreover, there is renewed emphasis on the importance of the H&P and how competency and acumen in the H&P may uncover an underlying diagnosis without the need for sophisticated testing, a consequential consideration especially in light of the contribution of diagnostic testing to overall health care costs. In the present issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings,_ Savoldi et al demonstrate the diagnostic significance of McArdle's sign in multiple sclerosis. This sign – reversible muscular weakness induced by neck flexion – was described more than 30 years ago in patients with multiple sclerosis, but it never received the attention it truly deserved, being cited in very few publications since its original description. Savoldi et al undertook a prospective study of patients with finger extension weakness (as a readout of McArdle's sign) and how it is affected by neck flexion and extension; the underlying diagnoses included multiple sclerosis, other myelopathies, and peripheral nerve lesions; healthy controls were also studied. Each enrolled subject was examined both clinically and by a torque measurement device by personnel blinded to the underlying diagnosis. The findings demonstrate that scoring of the severity of McArdle's sign (as assessed clinically) and quantitative evaluation of flexion-induced diminution in strength (as assessed isometrically and isoinertially) were significantly greater in patients with multiple sclerosis as compared with other myelopathies, neuropathies, and healthy controls. Additionally, the clinical assessment of McArdle's sign correlated with the quantitative assessment by the torque assessment device. The authors conclude that the presence of McArdle's sign should point to the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and that its quantitation by a recording device, and at a certain threshold, is completely specific and substantially sensitive for multiple sclerosis. The authors of this study are to be commended for discerning the significance of a largely ignored clinical symptom and sign; for determining by a prospective study its specificity and sensitivity in diagnosing multiple sclerosis; and for underscoring, by this salient example of McArdle's sign, the fundamental importance of the H&P in the diagnosis of disease.\n\n【3】Atherosclerotic Vasculopathy in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune condition that may impose acute recurrent inflammatory flares upon a backdrop of chronic progressive injury in diverse organs and tissues. Virtually any tissue and organ can be targeted by SLE, and this includes the vasculature. Such vascular involvement may be manifested as inflammation of blood vessels leading to vasculitis; thromboembolic disease that may be fostered by a coexisting antiphospholipid syndrome; reactive vasospasm leading to Raynaud's phenomenon; and systemic hypertension and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Less well appreciated is the increased occurrence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in SLE. In the current issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , the study by Katz et al is the largest one to-date that analyzed the prevalence of ASCVD in SLE. In this nested case-control study involving more than 250,000 hospitalized patients with SLE, the majority being women, Katz et al demonstrated that patients with SLE as compared with patients without SLE had a higher prevalence of ASCVD both before and after multivariable adjustment. This increased prevalence occurred in both women and men and was most marked in younger patients in the age range 30-49 years, the mean patient age being 51 years. Patients with SLE also exhibited increased prevalence for, specifically, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and cerebrovascular disease. This occurred despite the fact that percentages of SLE patients with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, history of smoking, or obesity were all less; SLE patients were more likely to exhibit chronic kidney disease and systemic hypertension, but adjustment for these risk factors did not alter the essential findings of this study. Thus traditional risk factors for ASCVD may not be readily invoked as contributory mechanisms for the increased occurrence of ASCVD in SLE. Such occurrence likely reflects SLE's inflammatory milieu. In SLE, the vascular endothelium is exposed to the smoldering inflammation and acute inflammatory flares that characterize SLE, thereby leading to endothelial activation and dysfunction, vascular oxidative stress, oxidation of LDL, the attendant activation and adherence of leukocytes and platelets, and the involvement of monocyte/macrophage-driven processes; this may set the stage for ASCVD, despite the absence of hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, the metabolic syndrome, and a smoking history. As available cardiovascular guidelines generally do not include SLE as a disease prone to ASCVD, this important study by Katz et al underscores the need for increased awareness of the increased risk for ASCVD in SLE, a risk that involves both sexes and younger patients, and the need for avoiding/mitigating any cardiovascular risk factors that may coexist.\n\n【5】Diabetes, Dementia, and Drugs\n-----------------------------\n\n【6】Populations in the United States and worldwide are aging at a remarkable rate, a phenomenon with profound implications for health care. The older adult is at a significantly increased risk for a host of chronic diseases, prominent among which is diabetes mellitus. The development of diabetes in older age, in turn, predisposes the older patient to a number of aging syndromes such as frailty, falls, sarcopenia, urinary incontinence, cognitive decline, and dementia. Indeed, type 2 diabetes mellitus is a significant contributor to the growing number of older adults with dementia in the United States. Dementia in diabetic adults is thought to arise from varied pathobiologic processes that include, among others, diabetes-induced inflammation and oxidative stress; the adverse effects of hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia; and endothelial dysfunction and diabetic cerebrovascular disease. But what about the drugs themselves that are used for glycemic control, and are they implicated in the risk for dementia in the older diabetic? In this regard, controversy surrounds whether such risks associate with the use of metformin, a biguanide that is a first-line agent in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. In the current issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , and in a study population involving more than 75,000 patients, Scherrer et al convincingly addressed this question by comparing the risk for incident dementia in Veterans Health Affairs patients who were treated either with metformin or sulfonylurea as monotherapy. The patient population did not receive any therapy for diabetes for at least two years preceding study entry, were without dementia at baseline, and had an average age of 61 years. The results demonstrated that following adjustments for confounding, and for those patients less than 75 years old, treatment with metformin was associated with a lower risk for dementia as compared with sulfonylurea. Moreover, similar results were obtained when such analyses were undertaken in another patient population with differing characteristics, namely, the patient population served by the Kaiser Permanente Washington health care system. These results are particularly reassuring, given the importance of metformin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and the increased risk of dementia in the older diabetic adult. Additionally, while the reduction in the risk of dementia associated with metformin usage was relatively modest, Scherrer et al note, contextually, that approval of drugs for dementia such donepezil was achieved even though the beneficial effects of such drugs in clinical trials were not striking. Finally, congruent with the findings of Scherrer et al are a number of experimental studies demonstrating that metformin may mitigate the senescence phenotype, improve cognitive function, and prolong lifespan.\n\n【7】Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR): Quo Vadis?\n---------------------------------------------------------", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

All participants were randomized to an alternative treatment group (AG) or to receive simvastatin (40 mg/d) in this open-label trial conducted between April 1, 2006, and June 30, 2006. The alternative treatment included therapeutic lifestyle changes, ingestion of red yeast rice, and fish oil supplements for 12 weeks. The simvastatin group received medication and traditional counseling. The primary outcome measure was the percentage change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Secondary measures were changes in other lipoproteins and weight loss.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】There was a statistically significant reduction in LDL-C levels in both the AG (-42.4%±15%) ( _P_ <.001) and the simvastatin group (-39.6%±20%) ( _P_ <.001).

New prescription drugs are relatively immune to free market competition on price because prolonged patent protections offered to them pose a significant barrier to the entry of competitors. Although this monopoly protection rewards innovation, when unduly prolonged it has a detrimental effect by allowing high unchecked prices to continue. One of the ways to bring prescription drugs into alignment with conventional free market principles is to encourage the entry of generics and biosimilars than can compete with the original innovator compound on price, once a reasonable period of protected status has elapsed. In this article, we explore the history and value of generics and biosimilars, barriers to full utilization, and the potential solutions that would help lower the cost of prescription drugs.\n\n【10】Background\n----------\n\n【11】The US patent system promotes the research and development of new pharmaceuticals by allowing patent holders (drug manufacturers) a period of market exclusivity during which they will ideally recoup their investment and enjoy profits that will fund future research.\n\n【12】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【13】Kewanee Oil Co v Bicron Corp, 416 US 470. 1974 : 480\n\n【14】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【15】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【16】US Const, art I, §8, cl 8.\n\n【17】Generic drugs are the therapeutic equivalents of their brand-name counterparts. They are identical with regard to active ingredients, indication and use, dosage, route of administration, safety, and quality. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (commonly referred to as Hatch-Waxman) was signed into law in 1984 and substantially expanded the generic pharmaceutical industry.\n\n【18】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【19】Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, Pub L No. 98-417, §101, 98 Stat 1585. 1984\n\n【20】Under Hatch-Waxman, a generic drug maker may use an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) instead of the more complicated new drug application to gain US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. With an ANDA, the generic drug maker must verify both the bioavailability and bioequivalence of their product in comparison to the brand-name agent but is not required to reproduce the stringent and expensive safety and clinical efficacy studies that yielded the original product approval.\n\n【21】Biosimilars are nonoriginal biological medicines with an active ingredient that mirrors the reference biological and have no clinically meaningful difference in safety, potency, or efficacy. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, a part of the Affordable Care Act, paved the pathway for FDA approval of biosimilars.\n\n【22】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【23】Similar to generics, biosimilars are not required to reproduce the original clinical data and can instead file an abbreviated biologics license application. The abbreviated approval process and lower up-front costs of biosimilars entice the entry of additional drug manufacturers to the market after the loss of patent protection and ultimately should lower prices for consumers.\n\n【24】Generic medicines have become an integral part of the pharmaceutical system, representing 9 out of every 10 US prescriptions,\n\n【25】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【26】IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science  \nMedicine spending and affordability in the United States: understanding patients’ costs for medicines.\n\n【27】yet they only account for 20% of pharmaceutical spending. As generics are approved, they sell at lower prices than the brand-name drug, and the price of the generic typically declines as more generic manufacturers for the same drug enter the market. An FDA analysis of prescription drug invoice-based wholesale prices revealed that for drugs with initial generic competition entering the market between 2015 and 2017, invoice prices dropped on average by 31% with 1 generic competitor, 44% with 2 generic competitors, and 73% with 4 generic competitors.\n\n【28】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【29】IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science  \nMedicine spending and affordability in the United States: understanding patients’ costs for medicines.\n\n【30】Another analysis found that within a year of the loss of brand exclusivity, generic drugs cost less than half as much as the brand-name drug, and within 3 years, generics are a third of the brand-name drug’s price.\n\n【31】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【32】Generic competition and drug prices: new evidence linking greater generic competition and lower generic drug prices.

These 11 molecules account for approximately $40 billion or 19% of the overall biological market that is now open to biosimilar competition. Biosimilars that are FDA-approved but have not been launched (2 molecules) represent an additional 17% of biological spending that will be exposed to biosimilar competition when they are launched. Currently, $67 billion or 32% of the biological market has biosimilars in development. The percentage of the market share penetration following biosimilar launch has been variable. For example, as of June 2020, the infliximab biosimilar had the lowest uptake at 6% since its launch in 2016, whereas bevacizumab had the highest biosimilar uptake with 2 competitors achieving 42% of the market within 1 year. The price decline between original and biosimilar average sales price has been variable, with savings ranging from 8.1% to 48.3%. From 2015, when the first biosimilar was launched, through the end of 2018, biosimilars saved the US health system $882 million.\n\n【40】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【41】2020 Generic drug & biosimilars access & savings in the U.S. report.

This insurance can be purchased either as a stand-alone plan or in conjunction with medical benefits through a Medicare Advantage plan. Prescription drug coverage and cost sharing were categorized through the placement of pharmaceuticals on 4 to 5 tiers, with lower cost sharing burden for drugs on lower tiers (tiers 1 and 2) and more cost sharing for those on higher tiers (tiers 3 through 5). Most recently, formularies have used 2 generic tiers (preferred and nonpreferred), 2 brand tiers (preferred and nonpreferred), and a specialty tier.\n\n【47】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【48】A study for the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee (MedPAC)  \nMedicare Part D Formularies, 2006-2010: A Chartbook.\n\n【49】2010\n\n【50】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【51】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【52】Medicare Part D in 2016 and trends over time.

Generic specialty drugs and biosimilars should have their own tier as a means of incentivizing beneficiaries to use them.\n\n【76】In an effort to maintain stable insurance premiums, a plan may place generics in higher tiers, thus decreasing plan liability for drug costs by increasing patient cost sharing. This annual balance between preserving consistent access to benefits while keeping competitive premiums in relationship to other insurance plans is known as _actuarial equivalence_ . Of note, the same analysis by Avalere Health revealed that plan liabilities for prescription drugs would have been 4.5% higher in 2019 if generics were included only in generic tiers.\n\n【77】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【78】Effect of potential policy change to Part D generic tiering on patient cost sharing and Part D plan costs. Avalere Health website.\n\n【79】The magnitude of the downstream effects of higher out-of-pocket expenses due to tier switching, including prescription abandonment and nonadherence, are unknown. However, because cost sharing impacts medication compliance, we would recommend against the use of tier switching to preserve actuarial equivalence. Understanding that tier switching helps mitigate premium increases, other cost control strategies would be necessary to keep premiums stable if the aforementioned changes were implemented.\n\n【80】### Generic Substitution\n\n【81】As generics become available for specific drugs, the assumption is that plans would quickly include them in their formularies and substitute them for brand-name drugs to promote access to a lower cost alternative for their beneficiaries. Indeed, some plans incentivize their members to switch to generics by differing the out-of-pocket cost to consumer if they choose generic vs brand-name drugs. However, this substitution does not always happen. A 2018 study by the US Department of Health and Human Services found that Medicare Part D spent $9 billion on brand-name drugs for which generics were available.\n\n【82】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【83】US Department of Health and Human Services  \nOffice of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. Savings available under full generic substitution of multiple source brand drugs in Medicare Part D.\n\n【84】It is estimated that $3 billion could have been saved if those generics had been substituted. A 2020 study by Avalere Health revealed that in 2017, generic substitution rates among non–low-income subsidy Medicare Part D plans was 75% or less in 48% of plans.\n\n【85】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【86】Variation in generic substitution rates among Part D plans. Avalere Health website.\n\n【87】Because Medicare Part D beneficiaries are unevenly distributed across plans and substitution rates vary by plan operator, the weighted average of generic substitution in 2017 was 85%. This proportion contrasts with the average generic substitution rate of 98% in commercial plans.\n\n【88】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【89】US Office of Personnel Management, Healthcare and Insurance  \nFEHB program carrier letter.\n\n【90】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【91】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【92】Utilization Review Accreditation Commission  \nURAC pharmacy benefit management performance measurement: aggregate summary performance report.\n\n【93】Generic substitution rates also vary by the price of the brand-name drug. Avalere Health found that 91% of plans will substitute a generic for a brand-name drug at least 75% of the time when the brand-name drug costs less than $100. However, only 22% of plans do this when the price of the brand-name drug exceeds $10,000.\n\n【94】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【95】Variation in generic substitution rates among Part D plans. Avalere Health website.\n\n【96】Delays in generic substitution are especially pronounced when the first generic for a brand-name drug becomes available. Research by the Association for Accessible Medications revealed that in up to half of Part D plans, it takes 3 years before a first generic becomes available in the formulary.\n\n【97】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【98】Association for Accessible Medications  \nAccess denied: why new generics are not reaching America’s seniors.\n\n【99】These deficiencies in generic substitution can in part be attributed to the Medicare Coverage Gap Discount Program and how brand-name drug rebates work in the catastrophic phase of Part D coverage. Medicare Part D coverage and the cost sharing between patients, manufacturers, plans, and Medicare vary depending on which phase patients are in. The dollar thresholds for these limits change annually. After a patient meets their deductible, they are in the initial coverage phase in which beneficiaries pay 25% and the plan pays 75%. In the coverage gap phase, cost sharing differs between brand-name and generic drugs. For brand-name drugs, patients pay 25%, plans pay 5%, and the drug manufacturer must provide a 70% discount. The manufacturer discount is counted toward the patient’s catastrophic out-of-pocket spending threshold. For generics, patients pay 25% and plans pay 75%. Once in the catastrophic coverage phase, patients pay 5%, plans pay 15%, and Medicare pays 80%\n\n【100】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【101】Kaiser Family Foundation  \nAn overview of the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit.\n\n【102】.\n\n【103】Figure 1 Medicare Part D benefit parameters.\n\n【104】Because of the difference in plan liability for brand-name vs generic drugs in the coverage cap (5% vs 75%), plans pay more for generics in the coverage gap even though the price of the generic is cheaper. Dusetzina et al\n\n【105】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【106】Sending the wrong price signal: why do some brand-name drugs cost Medicare beneficiaries less than generics?\n\n【107】found that patients may pay higher prices for generics vs brand-name drugs during the coverage gap. The preference for brand-name drugs during the coverage gap may exert negative market forces on generic competition, a necessity to bring down prices.\n\n【108】When the more expensive brand-name drug is preferred, plan liability may be lower but patients move quickly into catastrophic coverage, in which Medicare takes on the bulk of financial liability and manufacturer rebate sharing between the plan and Medicare significantly favors the plan. These differences in rebate sharing may allow a plan to make money on a brand-name drug and incentivizes plan preference for the brand-name drug, even though the out-of-pocket cost for patients and the total cost to Medicare is higher. This is one example of the “rebate trap.”\n\n【109】Figure 2 (part A) illustrates a simplistic example of a rebate trap for commercial plans. On entry of a biosimilar or generic, some brand-name drug manufacturers have threatened to remove rebates they provide to payors unless the competitor is effectively excluded from the formulary. Because prescribing patterns may be slow to change and adoption of a generic or biosimilar may take time, the adoption of the less expensive alternative and potential loss of the rebate may result in a higher cost to the plan. An insurer is thus incentivized to keep the lower-priced competitor off its formulary. Adapted from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2017 Report to Congress, Figure 2 (part B) illustrates the more complex interplay between the sharing of drug rebate and Medicare coinsurance in determining plan liability.\n\n【110】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【111】Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  \nReport to Congress: Medicare payment policy.\n\n【112】At the coinsurance rate of 80%, plans are incentivized to keep the more expensive agent in formulary and beneficiaries carry a larger financial burden. A sample adjustment of the coinsurance rate to 20% realigns plan liability with the overall cost of the therapy.\n\n【113】Figure 2 “Rebate trap” example. NA, not available. Data from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.\n\n【114】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【115】Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  \nReport to Congress: Medicare payment policy.\n\n【116】#### Solution\n\n【117】Require the adoption of generics and biosimilars into formularies on FDA approval. Proposals by the Trump administration to not allow manufacturer rebates to apply toward total beneficiary spending in the Coverage Gap Discount Program would discourage the preference for brand-name drugs, slow the progression into catastrophic coverage, and thus reduce Medicare liabilities.\n\n【118】<sup><a>28</a></sup>\n\n【119】Department of Health and Human Services  \nPutting America’s health first: FY 2020 President’s budget for HHS.\n\n【120】However, this step would also substantially increase patient out-of-pocket spending because patients are now in the coverage gap longer.\n\n【121】Restructuring plan and Medicare liability in the catastrophic coverage phase such that plans have a greater degree of cost sharing would eliminate financial incentives for plans to quickly move patients into catastrophic coverage. Indeed, these were the recommendations by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission in 2016 and were reaffirmed in 2020.\n\n【122】<sup><a>29</a></sup>\n\n【123】Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  \nImproving Medicare Part D.

In: Report to the Congress: Medicare and the Health Care Delivery System. Chapter 5. Published June 2020.\n\n【127】Lastly, changing the calculation of rebate sharing and coinsurance rate between plan sponsor and Medicare would challenge incentives for using high–list price, high-rebate drugs when generics or biosimilars are available. Because it is unknown the degree to which rebates are used by plan sponsors to lower premiums vs increasing profit, such a change may result in higher premiums for beneficiaries.\n\n【128】Manufacturers\n-------------\n\n【129】Drug manufacturers are private companies that either bring new index products to market or produce bioequivalent versions of established drugs. The board of directors and CEO of drug manufacturers have a fiduciary responsibility to maximize profits for shareholders. Executive compensation is dictated by the board of directors and is often tied directly to company profits, share price performance, and effective corporate governance. Pharmaceutical pricing, be it brand-name or generic, reflects these corporate interests.\n\n【130】### Generic “Parking”\n\n【131】When a generic drug manufacturer files an ANDA, it includes a paragraph IV certification that states that the generic drug manufacturer believes the patent on the brand-name drug is invalid, not infringed, or unenforceable. Under Hatch-Waxman, the filing of a paragraph IV certification is treated as an act of patent infringement and requires that the generic drug maker provide notice to the owner of the patented drug the legal basis for its patent challenge. The brand-name drug owner then has the option of suing the generic manufacturer sponsor with 45 days. If the brand-name drug owner brings a suit within this 45-day period, then the FDA can’t approve the ANDA for 30 months or until a court determines that the patents at issue are invalid or not infringed by the generic manufacturer.\n\n【132】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【133】Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, Pub L No. 98-417, §101, 98 Stat 1585. 1984\n\n【134】To incentivize initial entrants into the generic market for a compound, the Hatch-Waxman Act grants a 180-day period of exclusivity to the first generic company that successfully challenges the patent of a brand-name drug. This step provides a means by which generic companies can be the sole provider of a generic drug, charge a price premium, and recoup the financial burden required to contest patents. After the 180 days lapses, other generics filers are able to enter the market. Although the 180-day exclusivity is intended as an incentive, some manufacturers have undermined this process through generic “parking.”\n\n【135】Under Hatch-Waxman, the 180-day exclusivity period begins once the generic manufacturer is granted final marketing authorization for their generic. This means the first applicant whose ANDA is otherwise approvable could deliberately delay seeking final approval of their drug and prevent the FDA from triggering the 180-day exclusivity. Other interested generic manufacturers would have their ANDAs blocked from moving forward because of a first applicant’s continuing eligibility for the exclusivity period.\n\n【136】Why would a generic drug manufacturer delay entering into their exclusivity period? For some manufacturers, the promise of exclusivity and the control over when to exercise it can have strategic value. Former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb likens this to “a call option that the generic sponsor can hold onto.”\n\n【137】<sup><a>31</a></sup>\n\n【138】The HELP Committee’s fix for 180-day generic marketing exclusivity: does it solve the problem? _Health Affairs blog_ .\n\n【139】Generic manufacturers may also reach business agreements with the brand-name drug manufacturer to not launch their generic competitor and split some of the profits from the brand-name drug. This ploy effectively extends the patent of the brand-name drug. Although these agreements are decreasing in frequency following the Supreme Court’s _Fed Trade Comm’n vs Actavis, Inc_ decision, they still occur.\n\n【140】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【141】#### Solution\n\n【142】In the past year, several pieces of legislation have been introduced to address this issue.\n\n【143】<sup><a>33</a></sup>\n\n【144】BLOCKING Act of 2019. HR 938, 116th Cong, 1st Sess. 2019\n\n【145】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【146】<sup><a>34</a></sup>\n\n【147】Expanding Access to Low-Cost Generics Act of 2019.

S 1895, 116th Cong, 1st Sess. 2019\n\n【151】These proposals offer differing solutions, including loss of exclusivity if the generic manufacturer does not move through the approval process quickly enough, awarding exclusivity to the first manufacturer to successfully challenge the brand-name patents regardless of which manufacturer filed their ANDA first, and triggering the exclusivity period when a subsequent filer receives tentative approval if the original applicant hasn’t received final approval within 30 months of submission. Legislative actions to address generic parking must address the abuse while not cheapening the exclusivity period. The latter 2 solutions are more likely to promote competition among generic manufacturers and reward those actively trying to bring a generic to market.\n\n【152】Another consideration is extending the exclusivity period. Generic manufacturers may be “parking” their drugs because of a lack of perceived value of the exclusivity period in contrast to other financial incentives. By extending the duration of the exclusivity period and potential financial gain, this step may deter generic manufacturers from accepting alternative agreements that delay access.\n\n【153】### Evergreening, Product Hopping, and Patent Thickets\n\n【154】Patents on pharmaceuticals include far more than just the active ingredient (sometimes called “primary patents”). These “secondary patents” may include drug formulations (forms or dosage), methods of use, methods of manufacturing including manufacturing technologies, unique administration technologies, and other chemicals related to the active ingredient. In addition, if a person invents an improvement on any of these technologies, they have the option of filing for a new patent, which would start a new term of patent protection and exclusivity. The practice of filing these additional patents has yielded the pejorative terms of _evergreening_ , _product hopping_ , and _patent thickets_ —actions by drug manufacturers to preserve market exclusivity for their products.\n\n【155】_Evergreening_ has been defined as the practice of filing for new patents on secondary features of a particular product as earlier patents near expiration, thereby extending exclusivity past the original term.\n\n【156】<sup><a>36</a></sup>\n\n【157】May your drug price be evergreen.\n\n【158】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【159】<sup><a>37</a></sup>\n\n【160】Double patenting: follow-on pharmaceutical patents that suppress competition.\n\n【161】Often termed “lifecycle management”, these patents may delay or prevent entry by competitors. On average, there are 2.7 patents listed for each product listed in “the Orange Book” ( _Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations_ ).\n\n【162】<sup><a>38</a></sup>\n\n【163】How many patents does it take to make a drug - follow-on pharmaceutical patents and university licensing.\n\n【164】However, particularly profitable drugs are typically protected by numerous patents.

And this process is successful: of the roughly 100 best-selling drugs, more than 70% had their protection extended at least once, with almost 50% having the protection extended more than once.\n\n【168】<sup><a>38</a></sup>\n\n【169】How many patents does it take to make a drug - follow-on pharmaceutical patents and university licensing.\n\n【170】A 2012 study investigating the claims of 1304 patents in the Orange Book on all new entities approved in the United States between 1988 and 2005 found the following metrics on secondary patents: independent formulation patents added an average of 6.5 years, independent method of use patents added 7.4 years, and independent patents on polymorphs, isomers, prodrug, ester, and/or salt claims added 6.3 years to the patent life of an approved drug.\n\n【171】<sup><a>40</a></sup>\n\n【172】Polymorphs and prodrugs and salts (oh my!): an empirical analysis of “secondary” pharmaceutical patents.\n\n【173】They also found “evidence that late-filed independent secondary patents are more common for higher sales drugs.”\n\n【174】_Product hopping_ is the practice of brand-name manufacturers using their dominant market force to attempt to convince clinicians and consumers to adopt a newer version of the same (or similar) product covered by a later-expiring patent. These changes may represent a change in dosage or frequency (eg, moving from twice a day to an extended-release form), change in route of administration (eg, oral to sublingual), or a chemical change (citrate-free formulation).\n\n【175】<sup><a>41</a></sup>\n\n【176】A legal text for the pharmaceutical company practice of “product hopping.”.\n\n【177】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【178】<sup><a>42</a></sup>\n\n【179】Anticompetitive product changes in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\n【180】This effort may be accompanied by a marketing campaign, discounts, or rebates to incentivize doctors, insurers, and patients to adopt the new version.

Detractors allege that these thickets prevent generics from entering the market due to the risk of infringement and the high cost of patent litigation. AbbVie Inc’s Humira is considered a classic example with 132 issued patents.\n\n【190】<sup><a>46</a></sup>\n\n【191】This shield of patents protects the world’s best-selling drug. _Bloomberg Businessweek_ website.\n\n【192】Although originally due to lost patent protection in 2016, these additional patents offered nominal patent extension through 2034. Attempts to introduce Humira biosimilars have been met by litigation, with one lawsuit claiming that the biosimilar would infringe 1600 claims across 74 of AbbVie’s patents.\n\n【193】<sup><a>47</a></sup>\n\n【194】_AbbVie Inc v Boehringer Ingelheim Int’l GmbH_ .

Similar tactics have been adopted by other drug manufacturers, and the cost of litigating these patents can be substantial. It is estimated that these kinds of patent practices by brand-name manufacturers have resulted in $7.6 billion in lost biosimilar savings from 2012 to 2018.\n\n【196】<sup><a>39</a></sup>\n\n【197】Overpatented, overpriced: how excessive pharmaceutical patenting is extending monopolies and driving up drug prices. I-MAK website.\n\n【198】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【199】<sup><a>48</a></sup>\n\n【200】Association for Accessible Medications, Biosimilars Council  \nWhite Paper (Part 1): Failure to launch: patent abuse blocks access to biosimilars for America’s patients.\n\n【201】The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act provides a framework for the exchange of confidential information between a brand-name manufacturer and biosimilar challenger after the filing of an abbreviated biologics license application.\n\n【202】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【203】This process is colloquially referred to as the “patent dance” and if the maximum allowed time is used, can result in up to 250 days for the exchange of information.

A by-product of patent thickets includes issues with patent transparency: biosimilar challengers may be unaware of the full extent of patent protections for a brand-name product, and brand-namw drug companies may withhold information from competitors.\n\n【204】Drug manufacturers argue that filing late-stage secondary patents (evergreening) incentivizes research and development necessary to explore alternative uses for the therapy, encourages improvement of the product to address adverse effects, and mitigates lost time of exclusivity during development and that secondary patents do not prevent generic manufacturers from challenging the primary patent as long as they can design around the unexpired secondary patents.\n\n【205】<sup><a>49</a></sup>\n\n【206】GlaxoSmithKline  \nGSK Public policy positions: evergreening.\n\n【207】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【208】<sup><a>50</a></sup>\n\n【209】Holman CM.

They propose patent application examiners be given more time, better research resources, and external, third-party expert review. Another avenue is more robust enforcement of antitrust laws by the Federal Trade Commission. This step would be especially helpful in addressing anticompetitive product hopping. Improving patent transparency through public listing of patents for biologicals in the _Purple Book: Lists of Licensed Biological Products_ would rebalance the asymmetrical information landscape introduced by patent thickets and obviate the inefficiencies of the patent dance.\n\n【216】With passage of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011,\n\n【217】<sup><a>51</a></sup>\n\n【218】generic and biosimilar challengers have been able to dispute unmerited patents through the US Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board. If the Patent and Trademark Office decides to initiate a review of the patent, the patent challenger must prove that the patent is invalid by a preponderance of the evidence—a lower requirement than the clear and convincing evidence standard used when challenging the patent in court. This process, known as _inter partes review_ , tends to be faster and less costly than the court system.\n\n【219】<sup><a>52</a></sup>\n\n【220】Prior art in inter partes review.\n\n【221】A proposal by Wu and Cheng\n\n【222】<sup><a>53</a></sup>\n\n【223】Into the woods: a biologic patent thicket analysis.\n\n【224】includes trying to avoid the development of patent thickets to begin with by consolidating patents and exclusivities and promoting patent transparency. They suggest a fixed but flexible exclusivity period that could be adjusted based on development costs and with a limited number of potential “bonus” extensions for improvements deemed warranted by the FDA. Similarly, there is an option for exclusivity penalties when drug companies fail to properly disclose their inventions.\n\n【225】We propose a fixed patent life of 7 to 10 years that starts on the day of first FDA approval of a new prescription drug, a duration that is fixed regardless of subsequent new indications that are identified for the drug, as a straightforward solution to patent evergreening. Such an approach will encourage manufacturers to not “stagger” discoveries to prolong patent life and also provide generic and biosimilar manufacturers with a clear path to success after waiting the initial 7- to 10-year period of market exclusivity afforded to the innovator and freedom from litigation that inhibits the entry of multiple generic competitors for the same drug. Our current system places enormous regulatory, economic, and legal barriers for the entry of generics and biosimilars, which ultimately has a negative impact on the affordability of prescription drugs to our citizens.\n\n【226】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【227】Generic and biosimilar pharmaceuticals represent real potential savings to consumers, health systems, and payers while not compromising patient care. Strategies by payers including tier switching to control premium increases and delayed generic substitution to shift financial risk from the insurance plan to Medicare results in higher out-of-pocket expenses to consumers and unnecessary costs to the health care system. Manufacturers use a variety of methods to delay the arrival of generic or biosimilar competitors and maintain their market monopoly. The complexity of these tactics highlights the need for legislative and policy interventions to enable the cost-reducing power of generics and biosimilars to reach their full potential.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Despite his small size, he was named “athlete of the year” by his graduating high school class, and he enrolled in Simon Fraser University in Vancouver in 1976, where he studied kinesiology, played junior varsity basketball, and planned to become a physical education teacher.\n\n【1】Chronic leg pain after an automobile accident in November 1976 eventually led to the diagnosis of osteosarcoma involving Fox’s right leg in March 1977. He underwent an above-the-knee amputation, followed by more than a year of adjuvant chemotherapy at the BC Cancer Agency. Reportedly, one of Fox’s physicians told him that if he had been diagnosed a few years earlier, he would have received less effective chemotherapy with a poorer chance of long-term survival, which made Fox acutely aware of the importance of cancer research. He was upset when he learned of the limited cancer research funding in Canada at the time of his diagnosis and became motivated to act after witnessing some of the difficult experiences of his fellow patients with cancer.\n\n【2】Fox recovered remarkably quickly after his amputation and began to walk with a prosthesis less than a month after his surgery. He refused to consider himself disabled and joined a wheelchair basketball team a few months later, ultimately winning a national championship. After reading about Dick Traum, an amputee who completed the New York City Marathon in 1976, Fox decided to run the entire East-West length of Canada to raise money in support of cancer research. He trained relentlessly over 15 months, logging more than 3,000 running miles despite numerous injuries to his stump as well as his healthy leg, and he completed his first marathon (in British Columbia) in August 1979. He finished dead last but was loudly cheered by moved spectators. A letter-writing campaign resulted in early publicity for his transnational marathon plans, including donation of a support van by Ford and running shoes by Adidas, as well as the encouragement of the initially skeptical Canadian Cancer Society.\n\n【3】Fox’s “Marathon of Hope” began when he dipped his artificial leg in the Atlantic Ocean near St. John’s, Newfoundland, on April 12, 1980, and was intended to finish at the Pacific Ocean in Victoria, British Columbia, sometime in 1981. Initially, crowds along Fox's route were sparse and running was lonely. But, as time passed, interest escalated across the country. National media began extensive coverage of his quest, and his route was lined by well-wishers, donors, and fellow runners. Canadians of all ages followed his progress on television and were transfixed by his off-kilter stride and seemingly endless endurance. Fox never took a day off despite difficult weather, numerous injuries, careless drivers, and frequent arguments with his support team, which included his brother.\n\n【4】In late August 1980, Fox began to develop chest pain, cough, and shortness of breath, which resulted in hospitalization just outside of Thunder Bay in Western Ontario. He was found to have developed metastatic osteosarcoma in his lungs. By the time he had to abandon his marathon efforts, on September 1st—after running 143 consecutive days and covering more than 5,000 kilometers—he had raised $1.7 million for cancer research, and his story was known to millions of people in Canada and around the world.\n\n【5】Fox received numerous systemic treatments after his cancer recurred, including experimental interferon, but his disease progressed. Despite his weakened condition, he granted many interviews and continued to make appeals for cancer research funding until just before his death. On February 1, 1981, four months before his death, Fox achieved his original goal of raising $1 for every Canadian citizen; his Marathon of Hope Fund at the time totaled $24.17 million.\n\n【6】In September 1980, he became the youngest person ever to be named a Companion of the Order of Canada. The major research unit of the BC Cancer Agency in Vancouver received funds raised by the Marathon of Hope and was designated the “Terry Fox Laboratory” in 1981. After Fox died in June 1981, numerous roads, schools, athletic centers, parks, and fitness trails across Canada were named in his honor. A previously unnamed mountain in the Selkirk Range in British Columbia was christened Mount Terry Fox, and his story was dramatized in a film and in several books.\n\n【7】Since 1981, the Terry Fox Foundation has raised over $600 million for cancer research, and Fox has become an iconic figure for both disease advocates and disabled persons. The Terry Fox National School Run Day continues to involve thousands of schools and millions of students and teachers in Canada and across the world. In November 2004, Terry Fox was voted the second “Greatest Canadian of All Time” in a national poll organized by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n【8】Terry Fox has been honored twice philatelically by Canada. In 1982 (Scott #915), Fox became the first person ever to be depicted on a Canadian postage stamp without having been deceased for at least 10 years. He was included in Canada’s Millenium Series of postage stamps in January 2000 (Scott #1824) and was also the first individual Canadian depicted on a general circulation coin, a 2005 commemorative dollar.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

A chance meeting with Joseph von Mering (1849-1908) in the University library led to a discussion of pancreatic enzymes and ultimately a collaboration that showed that total pancreatectomy in dogs produced severe diabetes. Von Mering, echoing physiologist Claude Bernard, held the view that animals could not survive total pancreatectomy. He challenged Minkowski to prove him wrong, and on the following day Minkowski performed the first pancreatectomy with the assistance of von Mering. As the investigators had predicted, the dog developed severe diabetes manifested by glycosuria, polydipsia, polyuria, weakness, and weight loss. Minkowski then proceeded to perform total pancreatectomies on three more dogs, who also survived and developed diabetes. In 1889, Minkowski prepared a manuscript reporting their pancreatectomy results, emphasizing that no other organs were damaged during the surgical procedure; he put von Mering’s name first out of “courtesy” and also because von Mering was older than himself.\n\n【2】Although Minkowski had become a Prussian citizen and converted to Christianity, he was initially turned down for multiple professorships because he was of Jewish origin. Minkowski became chief physician at a community hospital in Köln and then in 1905 was named Professor of Medicine at Greifswald. B.A. Houssay, Nobel Prize winner from Argentina, sent a personal memorandum to the Prussian Minister of Education stating that “this man of great worth was continually being passed over for incomprehensible reasons.” Fortunately, in 1909 he became an “ordinarius” Professor in Breslau (now Wroclaw, Poland) where he remained until retirement in 1926.\n\n【3】In 1923, Minkowski and a team of other eminent European physicians were called to Moscow to care for Vladimir Lenin following a suspected stroke. The physicians could not agree on a diagnosis, and Lenin died the following year after another stroke and a seizure. Following retirement, Minkowski lived in Wiesbaden and then the Schloss-Sanatorium in Fürstenberg, where he died from bronchial pneumonia and thrombosis in 1931. His widow subsequently had to leave Germany because of rising persecution of Jews. Her escape was made possible by financial assistance from Charles Best. Minkowski's brother Hermann (1864-1909) was a famed mathematician who studied the geometry of numbers, and his son Rudolph (1895-1976) was a noted astronomer who led the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey in the 1950s.\n\n【4】In 1900, Oscar Minkowski described a familial hemolytic anemia (Minkowski-Chauffard Syndrome), now known as hereditary spherocytosis. He also recognized Korsakoff’s syndrome (a neurological disorder caused by thiamine deficiency) before Sergei Korsakoff. In addition, he described a patient with acromegaly in 1887 who had defects in the visual fields of both eyes from the marked enlargement of the pituitary gland found at autopsy. Minkowski was honored with a stamp issued by Lithuania (Scott #984) in 2012 and by the defunct Transkei (Scott #237) in 1990. His name is also linked to a prize given annually for meritorious research by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Differences in use of advanced therapies, in-hospital mortality, and bleeding events were compared between men and women.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 125,901 weighted hospitalizations with high-risk PE were identified during the study period; 46.3% were women (n=58,253). Women were older and had a higher prevalence of several comorbidities and risk factors of PE such as morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary disease, heart failure, and metastatic cancer. Systemic thrombolysis and catheter-directed interventions were more commonly used among women; however, mechanical circulatory support was less frequently used. In-hospital mortality was higher among women in the unadjusted analysis (30.7% vs 27.8%, _P_ <.001) and after propensity score matching (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 1.16; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.08 to 1.25; _P<._ 001), whereas the rates of intracranial hemorrhage and non–intracranial hemorrhage were not different. On multivariate regression analysis, female sex (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.21; _P_ <.001) was independently associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In this contemporary observational cohort of patients admitted with high-risk PE, women had higher rates of in-hospital mortality despite receiving advanced therapies more frequently, whereas the rate of major bleeding events was not different from men.

All records from all visits were reviewed for each patient to identify asthma-related visits at all sites of care from January 1, 2002, through December 31, 2003.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The study consisted of 397 adults and children. In 255 patients, 597 asthma medication changes occurred. Step-up changes usually occurred because of an exacerbation or loss of control of asthma and adhered to the medication hierarchy in the national asthma guidelines. Twenty step-up changes involved skipping inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) monotherapy and moving directly to combined ICSs plus a long-acting β-agonist (LABA). Lack of documentation of asthma symptom frequency or interference with activities made it impossible to determine whether these “skips” were appropriate. Only 78 physician-directed step-down changes were documented, usually to a lower dose of combined ICSs and LABAs or a move from combined ICSs and LABAs to anti-inflammatory monotherapy. Patients initiated additional step-down changes between encounters. Step-down changes occurred at routine or follow-up asthma visits, but the limited number of such visits provided few opportunities for step-down care.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】The continuing episodic-style treatment of asthma aimed at exacerbation management facilitates step-up changes in asthma therapy. The dearth of asthma evaluation visits limited opportunities to step down use of asthma medications and to provide long-term asthma management.\n\n【8】ED ( emergency department ), ICS ( inhaled corticosteroid ), LABA ( long-acting β-agonist ), LM ( leukotriene modifier ), NAEPP ( National Asthma Education and Prevention Program ), SABA ( short-acting β-agonist )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The treatment of acquired angioedema is shaped after that of hereditary angioedema. However, the acquired form is even less prevalent than the hereditary form, precluding large-scale studies. Thus, current experience is mainly based on case reports and case series. It should be kept in mind that acquired angioedema or C1 inhibitor deficiency is immune-mediated. Thus, in contrast to patients with the hereditary form, patients with acquired angioedema may be partially resistant to C1 inhibitor substitution (given as a concentrate or as fresh frozen plasma) because of hypercatabolism. Theoretically, the problem of C1-inhibitor catabolism can be bypassed by products that inhibit the bradykinin pathway. However, to my knowledge, studies on these new agents in acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency are currently nonexistent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Numerous café-au-lait spots were found across the trunk. The patient had previously undergone surgery 4 times during recent 10 years and had been diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) based on clinical symptoms and histopathological results. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive inhomogeneous signal intensity masses consisting of multiple flow void vascular structures. Computed tomography angiography  revealed multiple enlarged, mesh-like vascular malformations, involving popliteal and femoral arteries draining into the popliteal and femoral veins. The patient underwent surgical resection under combined spinal-epidural anesthesia. A fusiform incision centered in the masses was made. Surgical findings revealed affluent nourishing vessels of subcutaneous and deep soft tissue and extensive grayish black tissues, with local necrosis and cystic degeneration.

Electrocardiography showed slightly prolonged QTc and T-wave inversion across precordial leads. Chest computed tomography with contrast medium revealed massive bilateral pulmonary emboli (short arrows) and an 8-cm intracardiac thrombus traversing patent foramen ovale (PFO) (with each limb, 3-4 cm, in the left and right atrium \\[long arrow\\]). Transthoracic echocardiography of the heart confirmed the findings on computed tomography (supplemental video online linked to this article). Anticoagulation was initiated and the patient referred to cardiothoracic surgery for emergent clot removal.\n\n【1】A well-known cause of paradoxical emboli, PFO can cause stroke, limb ischemia, visceral infarction, or pulmonary embolism. Primary care physicians and hospitalists should have a high index of suspicion for detecting PFO during work-up for cryptogenic stroke.\n\n【2】Video\n-----\n\n【3】*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI0N2NlMDNlODFmNWIxOGE0YzhiYzBiNmFiMWU1NjUzMCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDIzODMwfQ.Akc8h0GT\\_DqAgtU5v6QwAgMR9JnGM2RFdUDBe21DyPNqYKyMBFZhEF5k7u4HVreeeyWwaAXjNn-QzwqAnRLdu\\_nqOFgqG09p6e9na\\_jPt2FKJ0tqx4WRgIv4h9cgYidPaf1ADloFL6JWsWCFT88SIVSv1AVandznRm7y1QEVS3ezW6vZuHRbYEtKjCWShBCioe6lQpHsOwDsizt7f2NwvNlxbpLT42PtyY9pEzFMNqFo17i\\_vOQAXBhNL6qxrzXAyuGbOy2yHOnRjPouv5ABt1vwCj5hzMiPS8aWKTPtBSOuOHUmVIR3Hhahhp339douTZUulCWUhqoodKcp\\_9XJ5w\n\n【4】    Download .mp4 (0.39 MB)\n\n【5】    Help with .mp4 files\n\n【6】    Transthoracic echocardiography of the heart confirmed the findings on computed tomography.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Abdominal ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and computed tomographic (CT) scanning are ordered increasingly to assess nonspecific abdominal complaints, to assist in evaluation of the extent of disease in patients with other cancers, and to be performed during routine cancer followup. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, approximately 90% of such solid renal masses represent renal cortical tumors.\n\n【6】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【7】Pathologic findings at the time of nephredomy for renal mass.\n\n【8】Consequently, the frequency of incidental detection of renal tumors has been increasing.\n\n【9】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【10】Incidentally delected renal cell carcinoma: role of ultrasonography.\n\n【11】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【12】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【13】Multiple primarv malignancies in renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【14】At our center, in 70% of patients operated on for renal cancer, the cancer has been diagnosed incidentally. Although 25% of patients present with large, locally advanced, or metastatic tumors, an excellent overall prognosis is now anticipated, with long-term survival in more than 75% of patients undergoing surgical management. With longer survival expected after treatment of the index tumor, patients with sporadic renal cancers remain at risk for comorbid medical illness as they age (ie, diabetes, hypertension, nephritis), which can adversely affect overall renal function. In addition, even in nonfamilial cases of renal cancer, a small but real risk of approximately 4% exists for development of a tumor in the contralateral kidney.\n\n【15】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【16】Bilateral non-familial renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【17】Understanding Histologic Variants of Renal Cortical Tumors\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】For many years, clinicians and pathologists have viewed solid renal masses as a single clinical entity termed broadly “hypernephroma”or “renal cell carcinoma.” Little attempt was made to organize observed histologic variants or gauge the potential impact of these variants on clinical outcome. Two decades of research have now replaced this single view of renal tumors with clearly defined, distinct histologic subtypes of renal cortical tumors with varying metastatic potential.\n\n【19】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【20】Presti JC Jr. Contemporary approach to the classification of renal epithelial tumors.\n\n【21】The sporadic renal cortical tumors also display different histologic subtypes broadly fitting into 4 major categories. These categories include the most potentially metastatic conventional clear cell carcinoma (65%), the intermediate-risk papillary (14%) and chromophobe (8%) tumors, and the virtually benign oncocytoma (10%). Preoperative attempts to reliably diagnose tumor histologic subtypes by standard imaging modalities or percutaneous biopsy techniques have to date been unsuccessful.\n\n【22】Intensive research into kindreds of patients with hereditary or familial forms of renal cancer, which account for less than 5% of patients with renal cortical tumors, led to the discovery of distinct molecular genetic defects.\n\n【23】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【24】Genetic and clinical aspects of familial renal neoplasms.\n\n【25】For example, mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (3p25) can lead to multiple and recurrent conventional renal cell carcinoma along with a spectrum of other tumors, including central nervous system and retinal hemangioblastoma, pheochromocytoma, pancreatic cystadenoma, epididymal cystadenoma, and islet cell tumors.\n\n【26】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【27】Tumor suppression bv the human von Hippel-Lindau gene product.\n\n【28】Multiple partial nephrectomies of a single kidney, often repeated on several occasions, are required when renal tumors reach 3 cm in diameter (well before metastatic potential is realized).

Mutation in the _MET_ oncogene (7q31-34) is also identified in 80% of patients with hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【38】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【39】Hereditary papillary renal cell careinoma: clinical studies in 10 families.\n\n【40】Recently a familial form of oncocytoma has been reported,\n\n【41】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【42】Inherited carcinomas of the kidney.\n\n【43】although the cytogenetic defects involved remain to be elucidated.\n\n【44】The insight gained from these molecular studies is stimulating research, using both radiologic and pathologic strategies, to develop a means to diagnose histologic subtype preoperatively. The idea of tailoring a surgical procedure based on the preoperative determination of histologic subtype is appealing and may allow for even more widespread use of kidney-sparing operations.\n\n【45】Changing Surgical Management of Renal Tumors\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【46】The traditional operation for localized kidney cancer, the perifascial radical nephrectomy, and its component parts of ipsilateral adrenalectomy and regional lymph node dissection are viewed by many urologic surgeons as the “gold standard” treatment for renal tumors, particularly in the presence of a normal contralateral kidney.\n\n【47】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【48】Radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【49】However, the component parts of this operation have never been tested in a prospective randomized trial. Current information from centers with a large clinical experience in renal cancer surgery, including our own, cannot demonstrate any therapeutic effect from either lymphadenectomy or ipsilateral adrenalectomy. Metastatic involvement in either of those sites is associated with a median survival of 9 months or less. For practical purposes, radical nephrectomy is still appropriately performed when the primary tumor is large and effectively replaces too much renal parenchyma for a kidney-sparing approach to be considered.\n\n【50】With the detection of many renal tumors at an earlier, more curable stage, the indications for kidney-sparing surgery have expanded.\n\n【51】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【52】Renal cell carcinoma: presentation, staging, and surgical treatment.\n\n【53】In the last 10 years, accumulated clinical evidence from several major American and European centers has shown the effectiveness and safety of kidney-sparing surgery (partial nephrectomy) in the treatment of renal tumors measuring 4 cm or smaller.\n\n【54】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【55】Nephron-sparing surgery for renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【56】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【57】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【58】Conservative surgery of renal cell tumors in 140 patients: 21 vears of experience.\n\n【59】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【60】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【61】Disease outcome in patients with low stage renal cell carcinoma treated with nephron sparing or radical surgery.\n\n【62】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【63】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【64】Surgical management of renal tumors 4 cm or less in a contemporary cohort.\n\n【65】Although most elective partial nephrectomies are performed in tumors measuring 4 cm or smaller, larger tumors in the polar regions of the kidney can also safely be resected by using partial nephrectomy. Common criticisms voiced by many surgeons regarding partial nephrectomy are that the potential for recurrent disease within the kidney (1%-4%) is great and that radical nephrectomy eliminates that concern. However, as has been the experience in von HippelLindau disease, patients who have had partial nephrectomy are under careful surveillance, and should the tumor recur, repeated partial nephrectomy could again be offered to the patient with no anticipated decrease in survival. During kidney-sparing surgery, the entire kidney surface is defatted and carefully inspected, both visually and with use of intraoperative ultrasonography, in search of satellite renal tumors that have escaped detection by preoperative CT scanning or ultrasonography.\n\n【66】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【67】Intraoperative sonography: application in renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【68】These small tumors can be millimeters in diameter, have histologic features identical to the larger, more clinically obvious tumors, and may enlarge to detectable recurrent disease. Identification of a small satellite renal tumor that can be excised completely should not contraindicate kidney-sparing surgery.\n\n【69】Patients with small, incidentally detected tumors are attractive candidates for laparoscopic and hand-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy. As with many laparoscopic procedures, the dividends of reduced hospital stay, reduced analgesic requirements, smaller incisions, and faster return to work are offset by increased operating room time, concerns regarding specimen entrapment and tumor spillage at the time of removal, access to training centers of excellence, the steep learning curve for laparoscopy, and quality assurance.\n\n【70】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【71】Advances in laparoscopic renal and ureleral surgery.\n\n【72】Laparoscopic total nephrectomy is being practiced widely, yet laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is under clinical investigation and attempted most enthusiastically for removal of small exophytic tumors in selected centers committed to minimally invasive surgery. Also under investigation in this good prognostic group of patients are alternative treatments for small renal tumors such as percutaneous or laparoscopically guided cryosurgery. Whether improvements in instrumentation, laparoscopic ultrasonography, and continued clinical experience with minimally invasive surgery will allow for partial nephrectomy to be done laparoscopically in more complicated central or subcortical tumors remains to be seen. The role of cryosurgical ablation needs to be studied in a randomized prospective trial with a control group of comparably sized renal tumors treated with partial nephrectomy.\n\n【73】Radical Nephrectomy vs Kidney-Sparing Surgery\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【74】The article by Lau et all is an important contribution to the urologic oncology literature from a number of vantage points. First, this is a large study of nephrectomy in the management of renal cancer that spans more than 3 decades, although 70% of the patients in their database were entered in the 1990s. Using valid statistical methods and closely matching 164 patients with renal tumors treated by partial or radical nephrectomy, the authors found no differences between the groups in relation to overall survival, cancer-specific survival, contralateral recurrence, perioperative complications, or the occurrence of metastatic disease. The most important observation in this well-done retrospective analysis is that patients treated by partial nephrectomy have a decreased cumulative incidence of chronic renal insufficiency, as defined by a serum creatinine level of greater than 2 mg/dL (11.6% of those who had partial nephrectomy vs 22.4% of those who had radical nephrectomy at 10 years) and a decreased risk of proteinuria (34.5% in patients who had partial nephrectomy vs 55.2% in the patients who had radical nephrectomy). Although more elaborate methods such as 24-hour urine collections for creatinine clearance and protein and nuclear renal scans could have strengthened the authors' case, the identified differences in serum creatinine levels and proteinuria certainly raise our concern that the liberal use of radical nephrectomy can be deleterious to the long-term health of the patient. In addition, as patients age, their overall muscle mass decreases, and the serum creatinine level underestimates overall renal function. The data presented by Lau et al do not display a difference in overall rates of dialysis between the partial and total nephrectomy patient groups. This lack may simply be due to the fact that 70% of the patients were operated on in the 1990s; these patients have not had enough years at risk for the development of overt renal failure.\n\n【75】The principal observation that renal function may be preserved in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy without sacrificing the effectiveness of the cancer operation is in contradistinction to what many urologic surgeons have been trained to believe, namely, that 1 kidney can effectively support an otherwise healthy patient for the duration of that patient's life. The commonly cited evidence to support radical nephrectomy and to oppose the liberal application of kidney-sparing surgery is that donor nephrectomy patients do not lose renal function over time. This donor population is not directly comparable since the median age of the donor is 37.5 years and the median age of the nephrectomy patient is 61.7 years. This 24-year difference likely accounts for the observations by Lau and colleagues relative to proteinuria and a rising serum creatinine level in patients undergoing radical nephrectomy. Whether a radical nephrectomy is done for a small renal tumor by open or minimally invasive techniques matters less than the real possibility that the loss of a kidney may set up the patient later in life for renal insufficiency or hemodialysis, both morbid and ultimately expensive medical problems.\n\n【76】Contemporary kidney cancer surgery must now focus on the variables not previously of concern to most urologic surgeons, including tumor histologic subtype, the possibility for late recurrence in the contralateral kidney, and concerns for the patient's renal function as the patient ages. There is now little question that kidney-sparing surgery provides the right amount of cancer control for the smaller renal tumors that are encountered commonly today. If an indolent form of renal cortical tumor could be diagnosed preoperatively, then more extensive partial nephrectomies could be done with the intent of providing local tumor control and preserving renal function. Should other major centers confirm the observations in this study, and they likely will, the already valid approach to the small renal tumor by partial nephrectomy, coupled with the fact that 35% of all renal cortical tumors carry a reduced or nonexistent metastatic potential, will make functional renal preservation a goal equal to local tumor control in the contemporary management of renal tumors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

More recent studies suggest that when serum creatinine concentration rises from a hemodynamic process such as appropriate blood pressure lowering or decongestion, WRF is no longer associated with adverse outcomes.\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】Impact of changes in blood pressure during the treatment of acute decompensated heart failure on renal and clinical outcomes.\n\n【3】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【4】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【5】B-type natriuretic peptide trend predicts clinical significance of worsening renal function in acute heart failure.\n\n【6】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【7】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【8】Acute kidney function declines in the context of decongestion in acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【9】Fortunately, this situation occurs most of the time, but still 15% to 30% of patients with WRF do not achieve adequate decongestion and have a significantly higher risk of death or heart failure readmission. Identifying these high-risk patients early during a hospitalization can be a challenge because they are a minority of all AHF patients. Furthermore, although we have refined our understanding of when WRF is clinically significant, identification of the pathophysiologic drivers for inadequate decongestion and adverse outcomes still proves elusive.\n\n【10】In this issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , He et al\n\n【11】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【12】Worsening of renal function among hospitalized patients with acute heart failure: phenotyping, outcomes, and predictors.\n\n【13】confirm the findings of prior studies and advance the field of WRF by approaching the problem with latent class analysis to phenotype subgroups of WRF that give clues to potential pathologic contributors to outcomes. Using 2 established randomized trials of AHF decongestion therapy, Diuretic Optimization Strategies Evaluation (DOSE) and Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (ROSE-AHF), the authors focused on those participants who developed WRF (defined as an increase of >0.3 mg/dL in serum creatinine concentration) within the first 72 hours of hospitalization. They included the 113 patients with WRF into a latent class analysis model that yielded 2 optimal subgroups of WRF.\n\n【14】The key feature defining these 2 populations was their response to diuretic therapy, defined as either minimally responsive to diuretics (MRD) or responsive to diuretics (RD), based on their urine output during the first 3 days of hospitalization. This is consistent with prior findings that congestion status discriminates WRF outcomes as the RD group had greater decongestion evidenced by greater fluid loss, greater weight loss, and a higher percentage achieving a decline of 30% or more in N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide. Significantly, distinguishing WRF by response to diuretics provides an actionable “stress test” that can trigger additional investigations and management, as opposed to a retrospective change in congestion markers.\n\n【15】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【16】Furosemide stress test and biomarkers for the prediction of AKI severity.\n\n【17】Indeed, this was seen here as WRF-MRD patients had WRF and a poor diuretic response much earlier (often within 24 hours) than WRF-RD patients. Focusing on diuretic response or conversely diuretic resistance has advantages: therapy can be escalated to potentially change the disease trajectory in this high-risk group; future observational studies can focus on this higher risk population to better understand drivers of adverse outcomes with WRF in AHF; and an appropriate population of WRF patients can be enrolled in clinical trials to ensure that new therapies are focused on the highest risk subgroup.\n\n【18】Diuretic responsiveness has often been evaluated by urine output per milligram of furosemide. The furosemide stress test (urine output per a 1- or 1.5-mg/kg dose of furosemide) has been used in critical care to identify patients with acute kidney injury who are more likely to progress to severe acute kidney injury or death.\n\n【19】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【20】Furosemide stress test and biomarkers for the prediction of AKI severity.\n\n【21】However, using urine output as a measure presents challenges, given potential inaccuracies with urine collection outside of a critical care or clinical trial setting. Furthermore, it does not necessarily reflect the goal of diuresis, which is natriuresis rather than aquaresis. Studies have reported that measuring a spot urine sodium level 2 hours after loop diuretic administration provides a stronger correlation with urinary sodium excretion.\n\n【22】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【23】Rapid and highly accurate prediction of poor loop diuretic natriuretic response in patients with heart failure.\n\n【24】Following spot urine sodium levels rather than urine output has been found to be prognostic with the furosemide stress test in AHF, and a small trial reported that a natriuresis-driven diuretic protocol better predicts diuretic response and can improve decongestion.\n\n【25】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【26】Natriuretic equation to predict loop diuretic response in patients with heart failure.\n\n【27】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【28】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【29】Potential role of natriuretic response to furosemide stress test during acute heart failure.\n\n【30】The findings of He et al reinforce this change in focus from WRF alone to WRF with diuretic resistance.\n\n【31】Other key findings from He at al include the comorbidities associated with an increased odds of WRF-MRD: diabetes and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Diabetes is a recognized cause of type 5 cardiorenal syndrome (a systemic condition leading to cardiac and kidney disease), and thus it is unsurprising that diabetic patients were more likely to experience WRF. However, diabetic patients specifically had more WRF-MDR, probably from preexisting diabetic kidney disease. Pathophysiologic processes potentially contributing to diuretic resistance in diabetic chronic kidney disease with decreased glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria include reduced loop diuretic delivery from reduced proximal tubular diuretic secretion, albuminuria binding loop diuretics in the tubule, and intrinsic tubulointerstitial fibrosis at the loop of Henle.\n\n【32】Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would seem an unlikely contributor to WRF, but studies have reported a pulmonary-renal connection with lung disease promoting acute kidney injury.\n\n【33】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【34】Ventilator-induced lung injury increases expression of endothelial inflammatory mediators in the kidney.\n\n【35】In addition, patients with COPD may have group 3 pulmonary hypertension leading to increased right ventricular failure and renal venous pressure, promoting diuretic resistance. Thus, lung disease and not AHF may be the driver of worse outcomes of WRF in AHF patients with concomitant lung disease. These findings require validation in larger studies, and the exact processes contributing to diuretic resistance in diabetes and COPD require further research as they may have implications for other populations.\n\n【36】Whereas the findings of He et al have helped further direct us toward clinically significant WRF in AHF, they are largely hypothesis generating, need validation in larger studies, and prompt many more questions. The most important question is how we might make these findings actionable so we can improve our patients’ outcomes. Does diuretic resistance result from underdosing of loop diuretic, or is augmentation with another diuretic necessary as suggested?\n\n【37】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【38】Compensatory distal reabsorption drives diuretic resistance in human heart failure.\n\n【39】Either of these scenarios may be appropriate for some WRF-MRD patients, but others may experience WRF-MRD from other pathophysiologic causes, such as intrinsic renal damage, a noncardiorenal process like infection or hypotension, or a comorbidity (like COPD) causing kidney injury or dysfunction. Could a standardized furosemide stress test with a spot urine sodium level be more informative for discriminating pathophysiologic drivers of WRF-MRD? This may be a more rapid way to discriminate WRF as RD or MRD and potentially point to contributing processes within or outside the kidney.\n\n【40】Although He et al were able to phenotype WRF patients into 2 groups, the overall sample size of 113 patients is small and limited the ability to perform an algorithm-based variable selection for latent class analysis, potentially excluding key distinguishing variables from the model. Indeed, there may be a need for further discrimination to identify the different pathophysiologic drivers of WRF-MRD and to identify features earlier than when WRF has occurred or diuretic resistance is noticed. This is an area in which biomarkers reflecting different pathophysiologic processes hold promise. Although prior studies of kidney injury biomarkers in AHF, including one done in the ROSE-AHF study, have largely been negative, this is likely because cardiorenal biomarkers were applied broadly to all AHF patients rather than focusing on the minority of patients with clinically significant WRF.\n\n【41】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【42】Worsening renal function in acute heart failure patients undergoing aggressive diuresis is not associated with tubular injury.\n\n【43】The findings of this study suggest that there is a rationale to evaluate cardiorenal biomarkers in a focused population of patients with WRF-MRD. This may finally reveal the promise of cardiorenal biomarkers and elucidate the pathophysiologic drivers of adverse outcomes. Such a personalized approach might finally be able to deliver the promise of early identification of high-risk patients and intervention based on the specific driver of WRF, thus improving our patients’ outcomes.\n\n【44】Potential Competing Interests\n-----------------------------\n\n【45】The authors report no competing interests.

They emphasize, as do the other authors, that the specific revised UAGA, although not implemented in every state, has had considerable influence on the availability of organs for transplant. Additionally, the revised UAGA has raised several important issues that must be considered by patients, their families, and health care professionals. For patients, the revised UAGA provides a mechanism for donation of organs by those who do not meet brain death criteria but whose organs are donated after cardiac death. Clinicians who care for patients who meet these criteria and become potential donors must understand the implications of the revised act and have systems in place to address them.\n\n【1】One of the most important implications of the revised UAGA is, as pointed out by McGregor et al, that it overrides decisions about withholding or withdrawing life support that a patient may describe in an AD. Patients and their families must be educated about this provision. In states where these provisions have been implemented, patients also must be educated about the importance of specifically defining their wishes regarding organ donation. The decision to designate one's wishes on a driver's license, an option in many states, is insufficient.\n\n【2】Institutional policies and procedures for organ donation after cardiac death are another important issue for health care professionals.\n\n【3】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【4】Non-heart beating organ donation.\n\n【5】Hospitals must have policies in place that are related to organ procurement and transplant for non-heart-beating donors, and they must ensure that these policies respect patient or surrogate decision making and autonomy. The process for donation must be understood by potential participants. The procedures are different for these donors than for donors who fulfill criteria for brain death. Health care professionals, including operating room nurses and anesthesiologists who have not traditionally been involved in withdrawal of support or clinical management issues related to organ donation, must be educated about these procedures and their role in the organ-procurement process. Their clinical and ethical concerns must be addressed.\n\n【6】With the increasing demand for organs, patients and health care professionals must understand the options for donation and their implications for end-of-life care. The articles by Nishimura et al and Go et al raise important issues related to ADs and the responsibilities of patients, surrogates, and health care professionals and institutions. The letter from McGregor et al raises additional important issues. This interchange is important and should encourage additional discussion, debate, and investigation so that we can most appropriately and effectively define patient wishes related to end-of-life care and their consequences.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Among his many important contributions was the isolation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). He demonstrated its involvement in numerous metabolic processes.\n\n【1】Sutherland was born on November 19, 1915, in Burlingame, a small town in eastern Kansas. His father had been a farmer in New Mexico and Oklahoma, but when the family moved to Kansas, he became a dry-goods merchant. Sutherland graduated from Washburn College in Topeka, Kan, in 1937 and received an MD degree from Washington University Medical School in St Louis, Mo, in 1942. After graduating from medical school, he served in the US Army until 1945, first as a battalion surgeon in the field and then as a staff physician in a military hospital in Germany. After being discharged from the army in 1945, Sutherland returned to St Louis to work in the laboratory of American biochemist and 1947 Nobel Prize laureate Carl F. Cori (1896–1984), who directed Sutherland to a research career. Sutherland became a professor at Washington University, and during his 8 years there he concentrated on 2 projects: the investigation of phosphorylase (an enzyme for initiating the breakdown of glycogen in the liver and in muscles) and the determination of how the hormones epinephrine and glucagon cause the liver to release glucose.\n\n【2】Sutherland remained in St Louis until 1953, when he was appointed professor and director of the department of medicine and the department of pharmacology at Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio (now Case Western Reserve University), where he discovered cAMP in 1956. He analyzed phosphorylase and found that 2 other enzymes are also present in liver extract: one that converts active phosphorylase to its inactive form, releasing inorganic phosphate, and another that reactivates the inactive form, incorporating inorganic phosphate into the molecule. This phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction is one of the basic biochemical energy-releasing processes of organisms.\n\n【3】In 1963, Sutherland became professor of physiology at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn, where he continued his research on cAMP. From 1973 until his death in 1974, he was on the faculty of the University of Miami Medical School (Fla).\n\n【4】After 1971, Sutherland turned his attention to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (3',5' -GMP) like which, like cAMP, is widely distributed in tissues. In addition, he investigated how the hormone adrenaline regulates carbohydrate metabolism by the role of cAMP intermediates in hormonal activities and the involvement of cAMP in the transmission of genetic information and in abnormal cell growth.\n\n【5】On May 9, 1974, at the age of 58 years, Sutherland had a massive esophageal hemorrhage and died in Miami, Fla. He was honored on a stamp issued by Guyana in 1995.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

We enrolled patients paneled in the primary care practice of Mayo Clinic's campus in Rochester, Minnesota. For this study, we identified all individuals who resided in SEMN (largely from 4 counties including Olmsted, Dodge, Wabasha, and Goodhue) on April 1, 2019, by using electronic health records.\n\n【52】The first COVID-19 case in Olmsted County was reported on March 11, 2020. As of July 1, 2020 (at the end of our present study between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020), the total number of COVID-19 cases were 37,210 in the state of Minnesota, 1076 in Olmsted (a population of 158,293), 83 in Dodge (a population of 20,934), 31 in Wabasha (a population of 21,627), and 127 in Goodhue (a population of 46,340) counties. The virus circulation remained relatively constant over the study period in the counties. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.\n\n【53】The study was designed as a cross-sectional study nested in a parent prospective cohort study, which enrolled a population-based sample of adults 50 years and older residing in SEMN and represents a stratified random sample by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the parent study can be found in the Supplemental Material . Subjects who agreed to participate in the present study were screened for COVID-19 symptoms and then were instructed to self-collect swabs (regardless of COVID-19 symptoms) of both the anterior nares and oropharynx (throat) using packaged testing kits distributed to consented participants between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Specimens were returned to the performing laboratory by a prearranged courier service within 24 hours for testing for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The study aims were to assess the prevalence and characteristics of COVID-19 cases on the basis of symptom status via a questionnaire survey completed by the participants at the time of swab collection. The institutional process for handling positive cases of COVID-19 was to be activated for positive results.\n\n【54】### Assessment of Exposure to and Symptoms of COVID-19 by a Survey at the Time of Testing\n\n【55】We established detailed exposure and symptom screening algorithms on the basis of the institutionally recommended guidelines derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\n【56】### Instructions for Self-collecting Swabs of Anterior Nares and Oropharynx\n\n【57】We developed instructions and workflow for self-collecting swabs of anterior nares and oropharynx  as reported by others.\n\n【58】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【59】Interim guidelines for collecting, handling, and testing clinical specimens from persons for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Of the 2325 adults who participated in the parent study, 1508 participated in this present study and 3 subjects were excluded as 2 subjects did not have reverse transcription PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 subject had missing survey data. There were no marked differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between those who participated and those who did not (data not shown). The mean age of subjects was 68±9.6 years, and women were represented by 59%. Although minority subjects (32 \\[2%\\]) were underrepresented in our study, 313 (21%) were rural residents, 566 (43%) were those with less than 4-year college education, 536 (38%) were those with SES below the median of our study population, 514 (35%) were current or former smokers, and 906 (60%) were those who had high-risk comorbidities for influenza (also for COVID-19).\n\n【79】Table 1 Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Study Participants (N=1505)\n\n【80】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【81】BMI, body mass index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HOUSES, Housing-based Socioeconomic Index; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【82】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【83】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【84】Data are presented as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n| Characteristic | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR | 0 (0) |\n| Age at the time of testing (y) | 68 ± 9.6 |\n| Sex |  |\n| Female | 885 (58.8) |\n| Male | 620 (41.2) |\n| Race/ethnicity |  |\n| American Indian/Alaskan Native | 4 (0.3) |\n| Asian | 11 (0.7) |\n| Black | 6 (0.4) |\n| Hispanic or Latino | 11 (0.7) |\n| Non-Hispanic white | 1457 (96.8) |\n| Unknown | 16 (1.1) |\n| Rurality |  |\n| Living in rural area | 312 (20.7) |\n| Living in urban area | 1193 (79.2) |\n| Socioeconomic status (HOUSES index in quartile) |  |\n| 1 (lowest) | 174 (12.3) |\n| 2 | 362 (25.5) |\n| 3 | 402 (28.3) |\n| 4 (highest) | 482 (33.9) |\n| Missing | 85 (5.6) |\n| Education level |  |\n| High school or less | 139 (10.6) |\n| Some college | 427 (32.4) |\n| Four year college graduate | 406 (30.8) |\n| Graduate or professional school | 345 (26.2) |\n| Missing | 188 (12.5) |\n| Smoking status |  |\n| Never | 951 (64.9) |\n| Former | 477 (32.6) |\n| Current | 37 (2.5) |\n| Missing | 40 (2.7) |\n| Chronic illnesscChronic illnesses were defined using electronic health records within 1 y of enrollment in the parent study. |  |\n| Any conditions | 908 (60.3) |\n| Hypertension | 576 (38.3) |\n| Coronary heart disease | 23 (1.5) |\n| Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) 72 (4.8) |  |\n| Chronic kidney diseases | 119 (7.9) |\n| Chronic liver diseases | 32 (2.1) |\n| Immune suppressive conditions | 70 (4.7) |\n| Malignant tumor | 212 (14.1) |\n| Congestive heart failure | 44 (2.9) |\n| Asthma | 118 (7.8) |\n| Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | 70 (4.7) |\n| Any other heart or lung disease | 304 (20.2) |\n| Diabetes mellitus | 164 (10.9) |\n\n【86】a BMI, body mass index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HOUSES, Housing-based Socioeconomic Index; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【87】b Data are presented as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n【88】c Chronic illnesses were defined using electronic health records within 1 y of enrollment in the parent study.\n\n【89】### Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Study Subjects\n\n【90】Characteristics of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 cases at the time of testing for SARS-CoV-2 are summarized in Table 2 . Only 28 (2%) study subjects reported being exposed to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time of testing, and most exposures were outside the household (27 \\[96%\\]). One hundred sixty subjects (11%) reported to have at least 1 clinical symptom at the time of testing. One hundred thirty nine participants (9%) were health care workers and 12% had traveled outside Minnesota. Most study subjects (86%)(1,282 \\[86%\\]) resided in a single family home, whereas only 216 participants (14%) resided in multiunit dwellings, mobile home communities, or other group quarters.\n\n【91】Table 2 COVID-19–Related Exposures at the Time of Testing for COVID-19 in Study Participants\n\n【92】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【93】COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.\n\n【94】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【95】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【96】Data are presented as No. (percentage).\n\n| COVID-19–related exposure | Variable |\n| --- | --- |\n| Close contact (ever)cClose contact was defined as being within ~6 ft (2 m) of another person for a prolonged period of time, which could occur while caring for or living with someone else, visiting, socializing, working, or sharing a health care waiting area.with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases |  |\n| No | 1344 (89.4) |\n| Yes | 28 (1.9) |\n| Unknown | 132 (8.8) |\n| Missing | 1 (0.1) |\n| Relationship with COVID-19 cases among those who had contact with COVID-19 cases |  |\n| Patient in health care setting | 8 (28.6) |\n| Household | 1 (3.6) |\n| Coworker | 5 (17.9) |\n| Other | 14 (50.0) |\n| Self-reported any symptoms within 14 d at the time of screening |  |\n| No | 1297 (89.0) |\n| Yes | 160 (11.0) |\n| Missing | 48 (3.2) |\n| Health care provider (eg, physicians, nurses) |  |\n| No | 1361 (90.7) |\n| Yes | 139 (9.3) |\n| Missing | 5 (0.3) |\n| Been outside Minnesota in the past 14 d |  |\n| No | 1312 (87.6) |\n| Yes | 185 (12.4) |\n| Missing | 8 (0.5) |\n| Been outside the United States in the past 14 d |  |\n| No | 1504 (100) |\n| Yes | 0 (0) |\n| Missing | 1 (0.1) |\n| Primary residence |  |\n| Single family home | 1282 (85.6) |\n| Multiunit dwelling | 199 (13.3) |\n| Nursing home | 4 (0.3) |\n| Room in home (others home) | 0 (0) |\n| Other community dwelling | 13 (0.9) |\n| Missing | 7 (0.5) |\n\n【98】a COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.\n\n【99】b Data are presented as No. (percentage).\n\n【100】c _Close contact_ was defined as being within ~6 ft (2 m) of another person for a prolonged period of time, which could occur while caring for or living with someone else, visiting, socializing, working, or sharing a health care waiting area.\n\n【101】### Prevalence of COVID-19 and Characteristics Mitigating the Risk of Transmitting COVID-19\n\n【102】Of the 1505 subjects tested for COVID-19, _none_ came back positive during the study period (May through June 2020). For this unexpected study result, given the multiple individual risk factors (eg, prevalent comorbidities and older age) for COVID-19 in our study subjects, we focused our analyses on identifying factors potentially mitigating the risk of transmitting COVID-19, which may have led to a significant reduction in the burden of COVID-19 cases in our study subjects and community.

One hundred nine (7%) had infections by 1 or more seasonal coronaviruses—HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43—during the flu season (October through April), and 7% had influenza A or B. Influenza vaccination within 1 year before enrollment in the parent study and pneumococcal vaccination ever before enrollment in the parent study were 452 (30%) and 803 (53%), respectively.\n\n【123】Discussion\n----------\n\n【124】To our knowledge, this is the first community-based population surveillance study in a well-defined population after the stay-at-home order was lifted, which comprehensively characterized the study population using clinical, virological, and behavioral data in the United States. Our results indicated that although the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43) in our study cohort (7%) was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season, there were _no COVID-19 cases_ among the 1505 study participants during the study period (between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020). Despite the large proportion of study subjects affected by risk factors for COVID-19 (eg, high-risk comorbidities for influenza and older age), _almost all subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures and 86% of participants resided in a single family housing units instead of high-density housing units (eg, apartments). Although our study results were unexpected and did not have a comparative reference group, they nonetheless provide an important insight into the characteristics of a population protected from COVID-19, where such protection is potentially rooted in adherence to public health recommendations and thus would support the current public health recommendations to be more fully implemented at the community, state, and national levels.\n\n【125】Our study results are unexpected given the reported prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in various study settings including the community. For example, 2 community-based population surveillance studies, which are similar to our study, reported the prevalence of COVID-19 (13 \\[0.6%\\] in a random sample of 2283 residents in Iceland \\[April 1-4\\]\n\n【126】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【127】Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic population.\n\n【128】and 1.2% in a sample of 2343 residents of Vo (out of 3275) in Italy \\[February 23-March 8\\]\n\n【129】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【130】10.1038/s41586-020-2956-7\\].\n\n【131】) and asymptomatic COVID-19 (7 of 13 \\[54%\\] in the Iceland study and 30 of 73 \\[41%\\] in the Italian study at the time of testing). As our study results were based on self-swab at home, one might be concerned about systematic performance biases (from subject’s specimen collection) leading to potential false negativity. However, during our study, the concordance rates for both respiratory syncytial virus and influenza between self-swab and swab by research staff were 99%. In addition, although it is not part of the present report, our ongoing work assessing the prevalence of COVID-19 during the flu season using the same processes and methods as the present study indeed found a positive case, suggesting that our study findings are unlikely to be due to performance biases or errors leading to false negativity.\n\n【132】Although our study participants overrepresented the White race as a protective factor for COVID-19 raising a selection bias, it is unlikely to account for our study finding. For example, the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections in our study cohort  was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season.\n\n【133】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【134】The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System by US laboratories (117 laboratories reported 854,575 HCoV tests) from July 2014 through June 2017 (ie, pre–COVID-19 pandemic) reported that 2.2% were positive for HCoV-OC43, 1.0% for HCoV-NL63, 0.8% for HCoV-229E, and 0.6% for HCoV-HKU1.\n\n【135】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【136】Also, the prevalence of influenza in our study participants during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7% whereas that of an older cohort _during the pre-COVID-19 pandemic was 7%_ .\n\n【137】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【138】Respiratory syncytial virus infection in elderly and high-risk adults.\n\n【139】Our study subjects exhibited a high health care worker rate (9%), which may mean a potentially higher chance of contacting people including patients as essential workers, but also they might have had better personal protective equipment, of which the net effects are unknown but presumably higher for COVID-19.\n\n【140】Our study results provide guidance to communities in terms of how to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\n\n【141】First, as shown in Table 1 , our study cohort encompasses population features representing both reported protective (eg, predominant White race and higher proportion of women) and risk (eg, high frequency of high-risk comorbidities and older age) factors for COVID-19. Apart from these nonmodifiable risk and protective factors, our study results indicated that _almost all study subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures for COVID-19, as shown in Table 3 .

However, we believe that the present single group analysis still provides a valuable insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19 without including an arbitrary reference group. The community prevalence of COVID-19 in this setting is relatively low compared with the national level (68 per 1,000,000 vs 847 per 1,000,000 as of July 1, 2020), so the results may not be generalizable to other study settings.

The combination of participants’ behavior in following the recommended public health measures and a social determinant of health, such as access to a single family housing, may significantly mitigate the risk of COVID-19. The biological effect of the preceding infections with non–SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviridae and its associated preexisting immune reactivity on the risk of COVID-19 remains to be determined.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Patients were subdivided into CKD stage III (baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, 30-59 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ) and CKD stage IV-V (baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, <30 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ) subgroups and separately underwent propensity score generation, stratification, and 1:1 matching. Rates of AKI, 30-day emergent dialysis, and mortality were compared between contrast and noncontrast groups. Sensitivity analyses examining only patients with stable prescan serum creatinine levels and incorporating intravenous fluid administration at the time of the CT scan into the model were also performed.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 6902 patients (4496 CKD stage III, matched: 1220 contrast and 1220 noncontrast; 2086 CKD stage IV-V, matched: 491 contrast and 491 noncontrast) were included in the study. After propensity score adjustment, rates of AKI, emergent dialysis, and mortality were not significantly higher in the contrast group than in the noncontrast group in either CKD subgroup (CKD stage III: OR, 0.65-1.00; _P_ <.001-.99 and CKD stage IV-V: OR, 0.93-2.33; _P_ \\=.22-.99).

To investigate the clinical importance of cytokines, SFTPD, and KL-6 in iPAP, we measured tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 2 (TNF, formerly TNF-α) and interleukin (IL) 1β in BALF and IL-6, IL-10, IL-8, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4, formerly MIP-1β), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2, formerly MCP-1), SFTPD, and KL-6 in both BALF and blood in 15 patients with iPAP and 48 patients with interstitial lung diseases (diseased controls) (including 20 with interstitial pneumonitis associated with collagen vascular diseases, 13 with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and 15 with sarcoidosis) and 20 individuals without pulmonary diseases (lung controls).\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Patients with iPAP had significantly higher levels of TNF, IL-6, IL-8, CCL4, CCL2, SFTPD, and KL-6 in BALF than did lung controls and had significantly higher levels of CCL4, CCL2, SFTPD, and KL-6 levels in BALF than did diseased controls. Patients with iPAP had significantly higher levels of IL-10, IL-8, CCL2, SFTPD, and KL-6 in blood than did lung controls and significantly higher levels of KL-6 in blood than did diseased controls. Levels of KL-6 both in BALF and blood were significantly correlated with serum lactate dehydrogenase level, arterial oxygen tension, and alveolar-arterial gradient in partial pressure of oxygen, the severity markers for iPAP, and were significantly higher in patients with iPAP who required subsequent therapeutic lung lavage.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Patients with iPAP had elevated levels of SFTPD, KL-6, and cytokines in both BALF and blood. Elevated levels of KL-6 in both BALF and blood may be valuable in reflecting disease severity of patients with iPAP and in determining the need for therapeutic lung lavage.\n\n【8】BALF ( bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ), CCL2 ( chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 ), CCL4 ( chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 ), GM-CSF ( granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ), IL ( interleukin ), ILD ( interstitial lung disease ), iPAP ( idiopathic pulmonary alveolar proteinosis ), IPF ( idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ), KL-6 ( Kerbs von Lungren 6 antigen ), LDH ( lactate dehydrogenase ), PAO2-PaO2 ( alveolar-arterial gradient in partial pressure of oxygen ), SFTPD ( surfactant protein D ), TNF ( tumor necrosis factor superfamily, member 2 )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}
