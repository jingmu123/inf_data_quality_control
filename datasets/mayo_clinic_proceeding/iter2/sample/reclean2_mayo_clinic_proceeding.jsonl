A total of 1002 patients undergoing TAVR were included. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data in the youngest group were compared with those of patients 76 to 86 years and older than 86 years.

Randomized controlled trials using fecal occult blood testing as the screening strategy have shown a reduction in mortality due to colorectal cancer. However, colorectal cancer differs from other cancers in that a variety of screening tests have been approved and recommended by experts. The advantages and disadvantages of different screening tests have been the subject of intense debate. Colonoscopy has theoretical advantages over other screening tests, including direct visualization of the entire colon and, more importantly, removal of precancerous adenomatous lesions.

He had no fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, poor oral intake, diarrhea, hematemesis, or melena. The pain did not correlate with food intake, and he did not have anorexia. He reported no dysuria, hematuria, recent travel, or herbal supplement or over-the-counter medication use, including any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n\n【1】His medical history was remarkable for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2b infection, normocytic anemia, cholecystectomy, fatty liver, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and alcohol and intravenous drug abuse. He had undergone liver biopsy 9 years before the current presentation, which showed minimally active (grade 1) HCV without fibrosis; a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test done at that time yielded negative results. Recent esophagogastroduodenoscopy performed for evaluation of chronic dyspepsia showed changes consistent with portal hypertensive gastropathy. His medications included simvastatin, amlodipine, and thiamine.\n\n【2】At presentation, the patient was hypertensive, alert, and oriented. He had multiple tattoos on his face, abdomen, and arms. Cardiac examination revealed normal heart sounds with no murmurs or elevated jugular venous pressure. His lungs were clear to auscultation. Although his abdomen was not distended, there was tenderness in the epigastrium and right upper and lower quadrants. Neither guarding nor rebound tenderness was noted. Bowel sounds were present, and his extremities were without edema. The remainder of the physical examination findings were unremarkable. Vital signs were as follows: pulse rate, 92 beats/min and regular; blood pressure, 162/113 mm Hg; temperature, 36.8°C; and oxygen saturation, 92% while the patient breathed room air.\n\n【3】Laboratory studies yielded the following results (reference ranges provided parenthetically): hemoglobin, 10.9 g/dL (13.5-17.5 g/dL); mean corpuscular volume, 86 fL (81.2-95.1 fL); platelet count, 244 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L (150-450 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L); white blood cell count, 12.6 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L (3.5-10.5 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L) with 10.3% neutrophils; sodium, 136 mmol/L (135-145 mmol/L); potassium, 4.4 mmol/L (3.6-5.2 mmol/L); serum urea nitrogen, 38 mg/dL (8-24 mg/dL); creatinine, 2.6 mg/dL (0.8-1.3 mg/dL) (baseline creatinine, 1.28 mg/dL 6 months previously); calcium, 8.0 mg/dL (8.9-10.1 mg/dL); international normalized ratio, 1 (0.8-1.2); aspartate aminotransferase, 44 U/L (8-48 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 40 U/L (7-55 U/L); alkaline phosphatase, 167 U/L (45-115 U/L); total bilirubin, 0.4 mg/dL (0.1-1.0 mg/dL); direct bilirubin, 0.0 mg/dL (0.0-0.3 mg/dL); serum albumin, 2.6 g/dL (3.4-4.7 g/dL); serum total protein, 5.8 g/dL (6.3-7.9 g/dL); amylase, 54 U/L (26-102 U/L); lipase, 170 U/L (10-73 U/L); erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 72 mm/h (0-22 mm/h); and C-reactive protein, 133 mg/L (≤8 mg/L). The patient was admitted to the hospital for inpatient evaluation of his abdominal pain and worsening renal function.\n\n【4】Abdominal radiography revealed a moderate amount of stool, a nonobstructive bowel gas pattern, and no free air. Radiography of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder showed no urinary tract calculi. Ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed a mildly coarse liver echo texture; borderline enlargement of the spleen; patent splenic veins, portal veins, and inferior vena cava; and postoperative changes from cholecystectomy. There was no biliary dilatation; the kidneys were of normal size, with normal echo texture and cortical thickness. No hydronephrosis or ascites were noted. Noncontrast computed tomography of the abdomen showed diverticulosis without diverticulitis. The abdominal pain resolved with oral analgesic agents. Urine output remained at 1 to 2 L/d during hospitalization.\n\n【5】*   **1.**\n\n【6】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ next test to evaluate the etiology of this patient’s acute-on-chronic kidney injury?**\n\n【7】    *   a.\n\n【8】        Blood culture\n\n【9】    *   b.\n\n【10】        Complement level determination\n\n【11】    *   c.\n\n【12】        Creatine kinase measurement\n\n【13】    *   d.\n\n【14】        Urinalysis with microscopic examination of the urine sediment\n\n【15】    *   e.\n\n【16】        Drug screen\n\n【17】Acute kidney injury (AKI) is the abrupt decline in kidney function that occurs over hours to days. The classic approach to AKI is to consider prerenal, renal, and postrenal etiologies. In this case, there was no clinical evidence of prerenal AKI based on history and physical examination. Renal ultrasonography ruled out postrenal causes. Although the patient’s kidneys were of normal size on ultrasonography, his baseline creatinine level was elevated, suggestive of chronic kidney disease, likely secondary to long-standing, uncontrolled hypertension.\n\n【18】Bacteremia may contribute to AKI; however, blood cultures alone would not provide information regarding the severity or etiology of the AKI. Accordingly, a blood culture would not be the most appropriate next test to evaluate the etiology. Complement levels may be decreased in some (eg, lupus nephritis) but not all glomerular diseases. Therefore, complement levels should not be used as initial testing. Myoglobinuric renal failure is a known complication of rhabdomyolysis. However, our patient’s presentation was not suggestive of rhabdomyolysis, so measurement of the creatine kinase level would not be indicated.\n\n【19】On microscopic examination of the urine sediment, different patterns are seen in renal vs either prerenal or postrenal injury. Most notably, hematuria with red blood cell (RBC) casts or dysmorphic RBCs with proteinuria is considered diagnostic of glomerular injury because these findings are absent in prerenal and postrenal injuries. Therefore, urinalysis with microscopic examination of the urine sediment would be the best test to perform at this time for evaluation of the patient’s acute-on-chronic kidney injury.\n\n【20】Given the patient’s history of drug abuse, a drug screen would be an appropriate test. However, it would not be the next best test to evaluate the etiology of the AKI, as neither a positive nor a negative test result would provide additional information regarding the type of acute-on-chronic kidney injury the patient is experiencing.\n\n【21】Urinalysis revealed 31 to 40 RBCs per high-powered field, more than 25% dysmorphic RBCs, and occasional hyaline oval and fat cell casts. Urine Gram stain results were negative. There was a predicted 24-hour urinary protein excretion of 13 g, consistent with nephrotic-range proteinuria (defined as >3.5 g/d). The fractional excretion of sodium was less than 1%. The C3 level was 146 mg/dL (75-175 mg/dL), and the C4 level was 28 mg/dL (14-40 mg/dL). An HCV RNA assay detected 5,750,000 IU/mL of HCV RNA. A follow-up HIV test result was negative. Both urine drug screen and blood cultures yielded negative findings.\n\n【22】*   **2.**\n\n【23】    **On the basis of the available clinical information, which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ cause of this patient’s acute-on-chronic kidney injury?**\n\n【24】    *   a.\n\n【25】        HCV-related glomerulonephritis\n\n【26】    *   b.\n\n【27】        Prerenal AKI\n\n【28】    *   c.\n\n【29】        Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)\n\n【30】    *   d.\n\n【31】        Henoch-Schönlein purpura\n\n【32】    *   e.\n\n【33】        Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN)\n\n【34】The patient presented with acute-on-chronic kidney injury in the context of chronic HCV infection. Urinalysis demonstrated dysmorphic RBCs and nephrotic-range proteinuria, consistent with glomerulonephritis. These findings would be consistent with glomerular injury associated with chronic HCV infection. Several types of renal disease have been associated with chronic HCV infection, including mixed cryoglobulinemia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), membranous nephropathy, and polyarteritis nodosa.\n\n【35】The MPGN associated with HCV infection is secondary to deposition of immune complexes in the glomeruli.\n\n【36】Other less common types of renal disease recognized in HCV infection include IgA nephropathy (IgAN) and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis.\n\n【37】Renal manifestations of hepatitis C virus infection.\n\n【38】Crescentic glomerulonephritis may be superimposed with any of these conditions.\n\n【39】This patient presented with a low fractional excretion of sodium, severe proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia, which may be indicative of a low circulating blood volume and resultant prerenal AKI. However, the diagnosis of prerenal AKI was less likely in the absence of a history suggestive of volume loss (diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding) and oliguria. In addition, the active urinary sediment and nephrotic-range proteinuria were highly indicative of an intrarenal glomerular process.\n\n【40】In any patient with AKI, other common causes of renal failure should be considered, such as ATN associated with infection. However, urinalysis results were consistent with glomerulonephritis and did not reveal findings of ATN, which would include muddy brown granular casts.\n\n【41】Henoch-Schönlein purpura is characterized by abdominal pain, kidney injury, palpable purpura, and arthralgias and/or myalgias that are often preceded by an infection. It is most common in patients younger than 20 years of age. Our patient did present with abdominal pain and acute renal failure with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, suggestive of a vasculitic process. However, his older age and the absence of other features of systemic vasculitis, such as palpable purpura and arthralgias, make Henoch-Schönlein purpura less likely as a cause of his acute-on-chronic kidney injury.\n\n【42】The classic presentation of AIN includes fever, rash, arthralgias, and AKI, with laboratory evidence of peripheral blood eosinophilia, eosinophiluria, and low-grade proteinuria. In this patient, nephrotic-range proteinuria, the absence of characteristic clinical and laboratory findings, and lack of exposure to medications that are associated with AIN (such as penicillins, proton pump inhibitors, rifampin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), argue against this diagnosis.\n\n【43】Urinalysis did not demonstrate white blood cell casts or eosinophils that would be suggestive of an acute interstitial process. Because of the presence of nephrotic-range proteinuria in the setting of dysmorphic RBCs, we consulted the nephrology service for assistance with the evaluation of his glomerulonephritis.\n\n【44】*   **3.**\n\n【45】    **Which _one_ of the following is the diagnostic test of choice at this time?**\n\n【46】    *   a.\n\n【47】        24-Hour urine collection for protein measurement\n\n【48】    *   b.\n\n【49】        Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) determination\n\n【50】    *   c.\n\n【51】        Cryoglobulin level measurement\n\n【52】    *   d.\n\n【53】        HIV antibodies and viral load determination\n\n【54】    *   e.\n\n【55】        Renal biopsy\n\n【56】Measurement of urinary protein is useful for both detecting and monitoring glomerular pathology. The criterion standard for the measurement of urinary protein excretion is a 24-hour urine collection, in which a normal value is defined as less than 150 mg of protein excreted per day. Even if performed correctly, this is not the procedure of choice to establish the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis.\n\n【57】Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody determinations, cryoglobulin measurements, and HIV serologies may be helpful in evaluating the etiology of the AKI because vasculitis, mixed cryoglobulinemia, and HIV-associated nephropathy, respectively, are glomerular processes associated with glomerulonephritis. Although the detection of ANCA, cryoglobulins, and/or HIV alone would be suggestive of the etiology, their presence in the serum would not be sufficient to confirm the etiology or diagnosis of glomerulonephritis.\n\n【58】In patients with glomerulonephritis, a renal biopsy is the diagnostic procedure of choice. Renal biopsy can provide diagnostic information and is useful in determining prognosis and the potential reversibility of renal failure.\n\n【59】Our patient underwent renal biopsy, and immunofluorescent staining of the specimen demonstrated mesangial IgA deposition, mesangial and endocapillary proliferation, and marked segmental and global glomerulosclerosis. Electron microscopy confirmed mesangial proliferation. These results were consistent with a diagnosis of IgAN. Findings on a connective tissue panel, including ANCA, anti–glomerular basement membrane antibodies, myeloperoxidase, and proteinase 3, were within the reference range. Moreover, cryoglobulin measurements and repeated HIV serologies yielded negative results.\n\n【60】*   **4.**\n\n【61】    **In patients with IgAN, which _one_ of the following factors is associated with a _poor_ prognosis?**\n\n【62】    *   a.\n\n【63】        Female gender\n\n【64】    *   b.\n\n【65】        Young age\n\n【66】    *   c.\n\n【67】        Hypertension\n\n【68】    *   d.\n\n【69】        Normal serum albumin level\n\n【70】    *   e.\n\n【71】        Preserved renal architecture on renal biopsy\n\n【72】IgA nephropathy is an indolent condition that may present with microscopic hematuria, gross hematuria, and/or edema, often following an upper respiratory tract infection. The risk of progression to end-stage renal disease over 2 decades is approximately 20% to 30%.\n\n【73】Risk factors for the loss of renal function identified thus far are male gender, older age at onset, hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, extensive glomerulosclerosis or interstitial fibrosis on renal biopsy, and proteinuria.\n\n【74】Because our patient is an older man with hypertension, hypoalbuminemia, and extensive segmental and global glomerulosclerosis on renal biopsy, he is at high risk for loss of renal function. Moreover, renal biopsy revealed a high degree of glomerulosclerosis, which indicated that his renal dysfunction may not be reversible. Further complicating the scenario was his difficult-to-control hypertension.\n\n【75】*   **5.**\n\n【76】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ antihypertensive agent for this patient?**\n\n【77】    *   a.\n\n【78】        Amlodipine\n\n【79】    *   b.\n\n【80】        Lisinopril\n\n【81】    *   c.\n\n【82】        Hydrochlorothiazide\n\n【83】    *   d.\n\n【84】        Metoprolol\n\n【85】    *   e.\n\n【86】        Prazosin\n\n【87】Although amlodipine is an effective antihypertensive agent, it may contribute to edema in this patient. In the setting of proteinuric kidney disease, either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker would be the most appropriate agent. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors generally reduce protein excretion by about 30% to 35% in patients with nondiabetic or diabetic chronic kidney disease. Other antihypertensives with antiproteinuric effects that may also be used include non–dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and aldosterone antagonists. Therefore, in this patient, it would be appropriate to initiate treatment with an ACEI, in addition to a low-sodium diet to enhance blood pressure control and reduce proteinuria. Hydrochlorothiazide, metoprolol, and prazosin do not have antiproteinuric effects, and they would not be the most appropriate agents in this scenario.\n\n【88】Lisinopril was added to our patient’s current antihypertensive regimen, resulting in improved blood pressure control. His acute-on-chronic kidney injury was initially managed conservatively without immunosuppression. He was discharged to home on hospital day 8, with fish oil added to his medications and scheduled follow-up in the nephrology and gastroenterology outpatient clinics. His creatinine level at discharge was 1.9 mg/dL. The initiation of immunosuppression and HCV treatment were delayed because of hospital readmissions for management of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and _Clostridium difficile_ infections, and because of ongoing chemical dependency. Recently, the patient has started immunosuppressive therapy with prednisone; his creatinine level remains stable at 1.9 mg/dL.\n\n【89】Discussion\n----------\n\n【90】The most frequent kidney disease associated with chronic HCV infection is MPGN with or without cryoglobulinemia.\n\n【91】In situ tissue destruction from deposition of virus nuclear protein and immunoglobulins in the glomerular capillary wall, renal interstitium, and tubules is a proposed mechanism of injury.\n\n【92】Other renal manifestations in chronic HCV infection are membranous nephropathy, proliferative glomerulonephritis, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and IgAN.\n\n【93】Primary IgAN is an immune complex–mediated glomerulonephritis defined immunohistologically by the presence of glomerular IgA deposits accompanied by a variety of histopathologic lesions.\n\n【94】It is characterized by microscopic hematuria, proteinuria, elevated serum IgA levels, and mesangial deposits of IgA.\n\n【95】Secondary IgAN is seen most commonly in patients with liver disease or mucosal inflammation, in particular affecting the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【96】In patients with chronic HCV infection, IgAN may be related to the pathophysiologic condition of liver cirrhosis, rather than to HCV (or hepatitis B virus) infection.\n\n【97】Hepatitis C and kidney disease.\n\n【98】IgA synthesis occurs primarily in the mucosa, predominantly involving polymeric IgA, IgA1, and IgA2 in about equal proportions. Normally, only a small amount of mucosal polymeric IgA reaches the circulation. In patients with chronic liver disease, increased circulating IgA directed against gut flora and IgA immune complexes have been reported. The glomerular deposits of IgA in IgAN appear to be exclusively of the IgA1 subclass. It has been proposed that in liver disease, the reduced phagocytic activity of the liver and spleen results in glomerular mesangial deposition due to the impaired clearance of circulating gastrointestinal immune complexes, allowing the circulating complexes to enter the systemic circulation via portacaval shunts.\n\n【99】IgA nephropathy associated with portal hypertension in liver cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic and non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis.\n\n【100】Although liver fibrosis was not detected on the liver biopsy our patient had undergone 9 years before the current presentation, in the setting of ongoing alcohol abuse and untreated HCV infection, it is likely that his liver disease had progressed, as further evidenced by the enlarged spleen imaged on ultrasonography, and the portal hypertensive gastropathy seen on esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Once deposited in the kidney, IgA1-containing immune complexes are associated with glomerular inflammation.\n\n【101】There are two approaches to the management of IgAN: nonimmunosuppressive and immunosuppressive therapies. Nonimmunosuppressive treatment strategies for patients with mild disease include aggressive blood pressure control with an ACEI and/or angiotensin II receptor blocker. Robust evidence of clinical benefit is lacking for lipid-lowering strategies, including statin therapy and fish oil. For patients with severe disease, immunosuppression with corticosteroid therapy may be beneficial. However, in patients with evidence of sclerosis, the benefit from immunosuppression is questionable. Cyclophosphamide should only be considered for crescentic IgAN with rapidly progressive renal failure.\n\n【102】Although antiviral therapy is the cornerstone of management of HCV infection, the optimal treatment strategy for IgAN in the setting of liver disease is less clear. Treatment of HCV infection may prevent progressive liver injury and may reduce immune complex deposition in the kidneys, thereby slowing the progression of renal disease.\n\n【103】In the absence of contraindications, such as known hypersensitivity, for patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) higher than 50 mL/min, pegylated interferon and ribavirin would be the treatment of choice in HCV genotype 2b infection.

The appellation _widow maker,_ which has been applied to this lesion (in part because of the large amount of myocardium that the left anterior descending artery supplies and its proximity to the distal left main coronary artery), has done nothing to allay this anxiety.\n\n【1】In the earliest days of interventional cardiology, the proximal left anterior descending artery was an attractive target for a percutaneous-based approach. Access to this region was nontortuous, and visualization was good; thus, even with early equipment, guidewires and balloons could usually be delivered to that segment. Indeed, the first patient who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) in September 1977 had such a lesion and has done well since that time.\n\n【2】In the more recent era, this lesion site remains attractive for the same reasons, particularly when some of the larger, less-flexible PTCA devices have been employed.\n\n【3】Cardiovascular surgeons have also been attracted to this anatomical segment, particularly when the left internal mammary artery could be used as a conduit. It has been well documented that the grafting of a patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending artery results in excellent long-term patient survival.\n\n【4】Influence of the internal-mammary-artery grall on lt)-year survival and other cardiac events.\n\n【5】Selection of the “optimal” means of revascularizing this specific segment has generated considerable controversy; while there have been relatively little controlled data, there has been no dearth of opinion. In developing the early Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation (BARI),\n\n【6】consideration was given to randomizing patients with an isolated, diseased proximal left anterior descending artery to either surgery or PTCA. This was not believed to be possible at many centers because opinions about the correct approach to treatment were so strongly held. This controversy is associated with the shortcomings of both an interventional approach and a surgical approach because of the improved initial angiographic results.\n\n【7】From the standpoint of interventional cardiology, with conventional balloon angioplasty, treatment of proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis was associated with increased restenosis rates, the potential for artery dissection, and acute or threatened vessel closure, which may propagate retrogradely to involve the left main coronary artery. Thus, even with conventional balloon angioplasty, a substantial amount of myocardium may remain at risk for ischemic injury. Optimal interventional treatment of this segment has been studied in randomized trials with various approaches, such as directional coronary atherectomy, debulking plus stent implantation, and stent implantation alone.\n\n【8】Coronary angioplasty versus left internal mammary artery grafting for isolated proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis.\n\n【9】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【10】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【11】A comparison of directional atherectomy with coronary angioplasty in palients with coronary artery disease.\n\n【12】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【13】Angioplasty of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery: initial success and long-term follow-up.\n\n【14】Currently, stent implantation remains the most common approach.\n\n【15】From the standpoint of cardiovascular surgery, there are also shortcomings. In some patients, albeit a small number, the left internal mammary artery may not be satisfactory as a conduit. In addition, an operation is a surgical procedure, and some patients would likely want to avoid or postpone surgery. The specific surgical approach has also been controversial-conventional open chest surgery, open chest surgery off pump, or minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB).\n\n【16】In addition to the shortcomings of each approach, controversy also relates to the end points used to compare the 2 revascularization strategies. Potential end points range widely . Depending on the specific end point and its importance for the patient, family, and physician, the results of comparing treatment options will vary. For example, if a patient wants to avoid surgery, then treatment with surgery would be an adverse end point. Alternatively, if a patient wants to avoid any repeated procedures, then an initial catheter-based intervention will result in an increase in adverse end points because of restenosis.\n\n【17】Table 1 Potential End Puints for Comparing Revascularization Strategies\n\n| Death | Quality of life |\n| --- | --- |\n| Myocardial infarction | Functional class |\n| Stroke or other central nervous system event | Functional/stress testing |\n|  | Economic cost |\n| Return to work | Repeated hospitali/ation |\n| Need for repeated procedures | Need for crossover procedures |\n\n【19】The randomized trial by Goy et al\n\n【20】A prospective randomized trial comparing stenting to internal mammary artery grafting for proximal, isolated de novo left anterior coronary artery stenosis: the SIMA Trial.\n\n【21】is an important addition to the scientific literature on the treatment of isolated proximal left anterior coronary artery stenosis, in that it compares stent implantation with surgery (including MIDCAB in some patients). In this randomized study of 123 patients, 121 of whom received treatment, the primary end point was a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and repeated revascularization. Secondary end points included angina functional class, exercise tolerance, quality of life, and drug therapy. Although the study will be completed at the end of 2002, this is an interim 2-year report. Because this study enrolled patients several years ago, it used old equipment including the Palmaz-Schatz stent (Johnson & Johnson, Warren, NJ), and only 6 patients had a MIDCAB procedure. Whether using later generations of stents or enrolling only patients with MIDCAB procedures would have made a significant difference is unclear. Of the 59 patients assigned to surgery, 5 (8%) elected to have stent implantation instead. Of the 62 patients assigned to stent implantation, none crossed over to surgery, although in 1 patient, a stent could not be delivered; this patient was treated with conventional dilation without untoward incident. In-hospital outcome was excellent in both groups: no deaths in the coronary artery bypass grafting group and 1 death in the stent group (2%), and 1 Q-wave infarction in the surgical group (2%) and none in the stent group (neither of which was statistically significant). Minor complications differed, with atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, bleeding, and creatine kinase-MB elevation significantly more frequent in the surgical group.\n\n【22】The mean ± SD follow-up in the Goy et al study was 2.4±0.9 years. Two deaths occurred in the surgical group. Additional revascularization procedures were necessary in 15 patients (24%) in the stent group. The primary composite end point of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and repeated revascularization was reached in 19 patients (31%) in the stent group and in 4 (7%) in the surgical group _(P<.001)._ However, the data could be interpreted differently. By the intention-to-treat analysis, in the surgical group, an additional 5 patients (those who were randomized to surgery but declined) required a procedure besides the initial randomized procedure. With this approach, 9 patients (15%) in the surgical group and 19 (31%) in the stent group had an adverse composite primary end point. This narrows the difference between the 2 treatment strategies considerably, but there is still a difference.\n\n【23】Of the secondary end points measured, including anginal functional class, functional testing, quality of life, and need for antianginal medications, none was significantly different. A discouraging note is that, although lipid-lowering drugs were used in more patients in the stent group, they were used in only 12 (21% of those patients.\n\n【24】What can be concluded from this trial? (1) In patients with isolated proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis, revascularization with either coronary artery bypass grafting or stenting results in excellent outcome in terms of survival and survival free of myocardial infarction at 2.4 years, as well as excellent relief of angina and improvement in exercise tolerance. (2) Restenosis still remains an issue, although it is less with stenting than with conventional dilation. Continued development of alternative strategies such as brachytherapy or drug-coated stents is still necessary.\n\n【25】Coronary angioplasty versus left internal mammary artery grafting for isolated proximal left anterior descending artery stenosis.\n\n【26】Catheter-based radiotherapy to inhibit restenosis after coronary stenting.\n\n【27】(3) Despite restenosis, of patients initially treated with stents for proximal left anterior descending artery disease, at 2.4 years of follow-up, 55 (89%) had avoided surgery. (4) Finally, the relative importance of each end point is open to discussion.\n\n【28】Accordingly, we agree wholeheartedly with the authors that this is a situation in which shared decision making with the patient should be implemented.

His home medications included aspirin (81 mg), pantoprazole (40 mg), paroxetine (37.5 mg), rosuvastatin (20 mg), and terazosin (10 mg) daily. Review of systems was notable for increasing exertional and supine shortness of breath. He also reported occasional chest discomfort on the right side with and without exertion.

On physical examination, the patient was a well-appearing man in no acute distress. His skin was warm, and no thyromegaly, cervical adenopathy, carotid bruit, or jugular vein distention was noted. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal rate and regular rhythm; the S <sub>1 </sub> and S <sub>2 </sub> were normal, but a notable grade 2/4 early diastolic decrescendo murmur was detected, most prominently heard over the right second intercostal space. Pulmonary examination revealed bilateral lower lobe rales. His abdomen was soft and nontender with normal bowel sounds. He was alert and oriented.

Murmurs are described by their shape (ie, crescendo, decrescendo, both, or continuous), the timing in systole or diastole, location and pitch, and audible intensity grade. A heart murmur may be benign or indicate valvular or structural abnormalities of the heart. Diastolic murmurs, however, are almost always pathologic.\n\n【15】The most common causes of diastolic murmurs are PR and AR. Pulmonary regurgitation is described as an early decrescendo blowing diastolic murmur. Pulmonary regurgitation is most commonly caused by pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【16】The diastolic murmur of AR tends to be a high-pitched diastolic decrescendo murmur that begins with A <sub>2 </sub> . Its duration in diastole depends on whether the AR is acute or chronic as well as the severity of the regurgitation.\n\n【17】Differentiation of PR murmur from AR can be difficult by auscultation alone. The correlation of the patient’s history with the physical examination plays an important role. The presence of known aortic pathology in this patient makes AR the most likely cause of his diastolic murmur.\n\n【18】The murmur associated with AS tends to be heard over the right second intercostal space. The AS murmur is a harsh systolic ejection murmur and may be transmitted to the carotid arteries. Because the murmur in our patient is diastolic, AS is unlikely.\n\n【19】Mitral stenosis causes a mid-diastolic murmur with an associated rumbling characteristic and an opening snap. This murmur is best heard over the cardiac apex and not the right second intercostal space. Our patient’s murmur was not associated with an opening snap.\n\n【20】Mitral regurgitation is characteristically a high-pitched holosystolic murmur best heard at the apex.

According to the 2020 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, TTE or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is essential not only for confirming the presence of the AR but also for determining the severity of the regurgitation and the etiology. It visualizes the aortic root and enables evaluation of left ventricular size and systolic function.\n\n【36】2020 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n【37】Although chest radiography provides adjunctive information about the effects of valvular dysfunction (ie, diagnosis of heart failure), it does not provide diagnostic information with regard to the nature of valvular disease.\n\n【38】Cardiac MRI is indicated if there has been inadequate evaluation of suspected valvular disease with TTE or TEE.

Electrocardiography revealed left atrial enlargement but no other notable abnormalities. Computed tomographic angiography of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolism yielded normal findings. The patient was admitted to the cardiology service for further monitoring. Lisinopril and furosemide were administered for his new-onset heart failure with subjective improvement in his symptoms of dyspnea.

Cardiorenal syndrome: classification, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment strategies; a scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n\n【56】Type 1 CRS is also known as acute CRS. It is caused by an acute heart failure exacerbation leading to an acute kidney injury (AKI). In the case of our patient, his increased creatinine level was likely caused by the administration of furosemide decreasing his preload. This decrease of his preload in the context of severe AR likely resulted in a lack of forward blood flow to the kidneys causing the AKI.\n\n【57】Type 2 CRS is also known as chronic CRS. It is a chronic state of heart failure that eventually causes chronic kidney disease (CKD) that results in the slow increase of creatinine over time. Type 2 CRS is unlikely to have been the cause of the acute creatinine rise in our patient because his creatinine level on admission was within normal limits. Given the acuity seen in our patient, type 1 CRS is more likely.\n\n【58】Type 3 CRS is also known as acute renocardiac syndrome. In this case, an AKI results in substantial volume overload resulting in an acute heart failure exacerbation. It is multifactorial, involving inflammatory markers and metabolic abnormalities with uremia. Because our patient’s symptoms of heart failure preceded his initial increase in creatinine, type 3 CRS is unlikely.\n\n【59】Type 4 CRS is also known as chronic renocardiac syndrome. It results from CKD leading to chronic heart failure. Over time, CKD will lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy. Our patient did not have baseline CKD, making type 4 CRS an unlikely cause of his increase in creatinine.\n\n【60】Type 5 CRS is also known as secondary cardiorenal syndrome. Secondary cardiorenal syndrome is caused by a systemic condition leading to reduction in cardiac and kidney function. Examples include sepsis, hypovolemic shock, or vasculitis. Our patient had no signs of another underlying systemic condition that would explain his kidney findings.\n\n【61】The patient’s diuretics were withheld, and dobutamine was administered for inotropic support to assist with increased renal perfusion. Once his AKI improved, he underwent cardiac catheterization, which identified nonobstructive coronary disease. Cardiac CT displayed normal coronary heights compatible for a valve-in-valve (ViV) procedure. His TEE was negative for signs of vegetations or paravalvular leak.

The outward push is caused by the grossly oversized transcatheter heart valve compared with the true internal diameter of the previously placed valve. It yields direct contact with coronary ostia or the sinotubular junction. This potential complication can likewise be due to patient-dependent anatomic factors such as low-lying coronary ostia or narrow sinotubular junction.\n\n【83】To determine preprocedural risks for coronary obstruction, patients undergo coronary angiography before ViV procedures.\n\n【84】Prosthetic valve endocarditis is always a possible concern.

Prosthetic valve regurgitation can be symptomatic or asymptomatic depending on the severity, hemodynamics, and provoking factors. The typical auscultatory finding is early diastolic decrescendo murmur with a blowing character that can be heard well on the second right intercostal space and left sternum. Symptomatic patients can present with unexplained or new-onset heart failure or severe hemolysis. In those symptomatic patients, infective endocarditis should be kept in mind and excluded first. If it is suspected, antibiotic treatment should be initiated to avoid delay in surgical or transcatheter intervention. In symptomatic patients with prosthetic valve regurgitation, the appropriate management is correction of the underlying valve failure. Even in asymptomatic patients, replacement may be considered because of rapid disease progression. The backward flow of AR can cause systolic dysfunction and decrease in cardiac output. Type 1 CRS is associated with diminished end-organ perfusion secondary to acute decompensated heart failure. Management with inotropic agents can increase kidney perfusion and help improve this condition. In cases of AKI secondary to acute valvular disease, kidney function improves after correction of the underlying structural abnormality.\n\n【109】For a long period of time, the standard practice of valvular reintervention was surgery. Given the drastic increase in the use of bioprosthetic valves and concomitant increase in the requirement of reoperation, less invasive procedures were developed. The transcatheter ViV procedure was first performed in Germany in 2007 for aortic valve replacement. Since then, it has become an attractive alternative for patients who are not candidates for surgery. The updated 2020 ACC/AHA guideline helped elucidate the choice of intervention between surgery or a ViV procedure. It was recommended to begin the evaluation with either TTE or TEE.\n\n【110】2020 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n【111】If the patient is asymptomatic but has severe regurgitation, surgery is recommended (class 2a).

According to the 2020 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, TTE or transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is essential not only for confirming the presence of the AR but also for determining the severity of the regurgitation and the etiology. It visualizes the aortic root and enables evaluation of left ventricular size and systolic function.\n\n【36】2020 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n【37】Although chest radiography provides adjunctive information about the effects of valvular dysfunction (ie, diagnosis of heart failure), it does not provide diagnostic information with regard to the nature of valvular disease.\n\n【38】Cardiac MRI is indicated if there has been inadequate evaluation of suspected valvular disease with TTE or TEE.

Electrocardiography revealed left atrial enlargement but no other notable abnormalities. Computed tomographic angiography of the chest to rule out pulmonary embolism yielded normal findings. The patient was admitted to the cardiology service for further monitoring. Lisinopril and furosemide were administered for his new-onset heart failure with subjective improvement in his symptoms of dyspnea. On day 2 of hospitalization, however, he had an acute increase in creatinine from his baseline of 1.16 mg/dL to 1.94 mg/dL.\n\n【42】*   3.\n\n【43】    **Which _one_ of the following _best_ explains the increase in this patient’s creatinine level?**\n\n【44】    *   a.\n\n【45】        Type 1 cardiorenal syndrome (CRS)\n\n【46】    *   b.\n\n【47】        Type 2 CRS\n\n【48】    *   c.\n\n【49】        Type 3 CRS\n\n【50】    *   d.\n\n【51】        Type 4 CRS\n\n【52】    *   e.\n\n【53】        Type 5 CRS\n\n【54】Cardiorenal syndrome is a complex medical condition in which an insult to either the heart or the kidneys causes dysfunction in the other organ. The timing of the inciting event can be either acute or chronic and is dependent on multiple factors including hemodynamics, neurohormonal markers, and inflammatory signals.\n\n【55】American Heart Association Council on the Kidney in Cardiovascular Disease and Council on Clinical Cardiology. Cardiorenal syndrome: classification, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment strategies; a scientific statement from the American Heart Association.\n\n【56】Type 1 CRS is also known as acute CRS. It is caused by an acute heart failure exacerbation leading to an acute kidney injury (AKI). In the case of our patient, his increased creatinine level was likely caused by the administration of furosemide decreasing his preload. This decrease of his preload in the context of severe AR likely resulted in a lack of forward blood flow to the kidneys causing the AKI.\n\n【57】Type 2 CRS is also known as chronic CRS. It is a chronic state of heart failure that eventually causes chronic kidney disease (CKD) that results in the slow increase of creatinine over time. Type 2 CRS is unlikely to have been the cause of the acute creatinine rise in our patient because his creatinine level on admission was within normal limits. Given the acuity seen in our patient, type 1 CRS is more likely.\n\n【58】Type 3 CRS is also known as acute renocardiac syndrome. In this case, an AKI results in substantial volume overload resulting in an acute heart failure exacerbation. It is multifactorial, involving inflammatory markers and metabolic abnormalities with uremia. Because our patient’s symptoms of heart failure preceded his initial increase in creatinine, type 3 CRS is unlikely.\n\n【59】Type 4 CRS is also known as chronic renocardiac syndrome. It results from CKD leading to chronic heart failure. Over time, CKD will lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy. Our patient did not have baseline CKD, making type 4 CRS an unlikely cause of his increase in creatinine.\n\n【60】Type 5 CRS is also known as secondary cardiorenal syndrome. Secondary cardiorenal syndrome is caused by a systemic condition leading to reduction in cardiac and kidney function. Examples include sepsis, hypovolemic shock, or vasculitis. Our patient had no signs of another underlying systemic condition that would explain his kidney findings.\n\n【61】The patient’s diuretics were withheld, and dobutamine was administered for inotropic support to assist with increased renal perfusion. Once his AKI improved, he underwent cardiac catheterization, which identified nonobstructive coronary disease. Cardiac CT displayed normal coronary heights compatible for a valve-in-valve (ViV) procedure. His TEE was negative for signs of vegetations or paravalvular leak. On day 8 of hospitalization, he underwent the ViV replacement without complications.\n\n【62】*   4.\n\n【63】    **Compared with this patient’s original valve replacement, which _one_ of the following complications poses the _highest_ risk following the ViV procedure?**\n\n【64】    *   a.\n\n【65】        Complete heart block leading to pacemaker implantation\n\n【66】    *   b.\n\n【67】        Paravalvular leak\n\n【68】    *   c.\n\n【69】        Annulus rupture\n\n【70】    *   d.\n\n【71】        Coronary artery obstruction\n\n【72】    *   e.\n\n【73】        Prosthetic valve endocarditis\n\n【74】删除21:<u>The use of bioprosthetic valves has increased in the past few decades, resulting in an increased rate of valve degeneration and the need for reintervention.

The rigid and round structure of the valve allows better fit and an appropriately positioned valve causing less paravalvular leak. It also provides more consistent anchoring; the risk of annulus rupture is less likely.\n\n【79】One of the most reported ViV procedural concerns compared with initial transcatheter aortic valve replacement is coronary obstruction.\n\n【80】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【81】Valve-in-valve TAVR: state-of-the-art review.\n\n【82】The obstruction is due to the bioprosthetic leaflets being pushed outward by the newly placed transcatheter heart valve. The outward push is caused by the grossly oversized transcatheter heart valve compared with the true internal diameter of the previously placed valve. It yields direct contact with coronary ostia or the sinotubular junction. This potential complication can likewise be due to patient-dependent anatomic factors such as low-lying coronary ostia or narrow sinotubular junction.\n\n【83】To determine preprocedural risks for coronary obstruction, patients undergo coronary angiography before ViV procedures.\n\n【84】Prosthetic valve endocarditis is always a possible concern. However, the reported rates for ViV complications are not as well studied or documented as for coronary artery obstruction.\n\n【85】Postprocedural TTE identified a decline in the left ventricular ejection fraction to 40% with worsened anterior and septal wall motion abnormalities but improvement in the patient’s aortic insufficiency and the replacement valve in the correct location. Subjectively, he felt considerably better than on admission, and he was discharged to home with the addition of lisinopril (2.5 mg daily) and warfarin for 6 months.\n\n【86】*   5.\n\n【87】    **Which _one_ of the following procedures would warrant empirical antibiotic prophylaxis for this patient?**\n\n【88】    *   a.\n\n【89】        Cardiac catheterization\n\n【90】    *   b.\n\n【91】        Colonoscopy with biopsy\n\n【92】    *   c.\n\n【93】        Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\n\n【94】    *   d.\n\n【95】        Bone marrow biopsy\n\n【96】    *   e.\n\n【97】        Bronchoscopy with biopsy\n\n【98】Prosthetic heart valves confer one of the highest risks of complications if infective endocarditis occurs.\n\n【99】Prevention of infective endocarditis: guidelines from the American Heart Association; a guideline from the American Heart Association Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease Committee, Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young, and the Council on Clinical Cardiology, Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia, and the Quality of Care and Outcomes Research Interdisciplinary Working Group.\n\n【100】Cardiac surgery, but not cardiac catheterization, would require antibiotic prophylaxis.\n\n【101】Colonoscopies with or without biopsy would not require antibiotic prophylaxis because the risk of bacterial translocation to the prosthetic heart valves is considered low.

However, if there are signs of infected skin or soft tissue above the biopsy site, then antibiotics against _Staphylococcus aureus_ and β-hemolytic streptococci should be administered.\n\n【103】Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in patients undergoing bronchoscopy with planned biopsy.

Prosthetic valve regurgitation can be symptomatic or asymptomatic depending on the severity, hemodynamics, and provoking factors. The typical auscultatory finding is early diastolic decrescendo murmur with a blowing character that can be heard well on the second right intercostal space and left sternum. Symptomatic patients can present with unexplained or new-onset heart failure or severe hemolysis. In those symptomatic patients, infective endocarditis should be kept in mind and excluded first. If it is suspected, antibiotic treatment should be initiated to avoid delay in surgical or transcatheter intervention. In symptomatic patients with prosthetic valve regurgitation, the appropriate management is correction of the underlying valve failure. Even in asymptomatic patients, replacement may be considered because of rapid disease progression. The backward flow of AR can cause systolic dysfunction and decrease in cardiac output. Type 1 CRS is associated with diminished end-organ perfusion secondary to acute decompensated heart failure. Management with inotropic agents can increase kidney perfusion and help improve this condition. In cases of AKI secondary to acute valvular disease, kidney function improves after correction of the underlying structural abnormality.\n\n【109】For a long period of time, the standard practice of valvular reintervention was surgery. Given the drastic increase in the use of bioprosthetic valves and concomitant increase in the requirement of reoperation, less invasive procedures were developed. The transcatheter ViV procedure was first performed in Germany in 2007 for aortic valve replacement. Since then, it has become an attractive alternative for patients who are not candidates for surgery. The updated 2020 ACC/AHA guideline helped elucidate the choice of intervention between surgery or a ViV procedure.

The rigid and round structure of the valve allows better fit and an appropriately positioned valve causing less paravalvular leak.

The outward push is caused by the grossly oversized transcatheter heart valve compared with the true internal diameter of the previously placed valve. It yields direct contact with coronary ostia or the sinotubular junction. This potential complication can likewise be due to patient-dependent anatomic factors such as low-lying coronary ostia or narrow sinotubular junction.\n\n【83】To determine preprocedural risks for coronary obstruction, patients undergo coronary angiography before ViV procedures.\n\n【84】Prosthetic valve endocarditis is always a possible concern.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is also considered a low-risk procedure that would not necessitate prophylaxis.\n\n【102】Bone marrow biopsies are considered low-risk procedures. However, if there are signs of infected skin or soft tissue above the biopsy site, then antibiotics against _Staphylococcus aureus_ and β-hemolytic streptococci should be administered.\n\n【103】Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in patients undergoing bronchoscopy with planned biopsy.

Prosthetic valve regurgitation can be symptomatic or asymptomatic depending on the severity, hemodynamics, and provoking factors. The typical auscultatory finding is early diastolic decrescendo murmur with a blowing character that can be heard well on the second right intercostal space and left sternum. Symptomatic patients can present with unexplained or new-onset heart failure or severe hemolysis. In those symptomatic patients, infective endocarditis should be kept in mind and excluded first. If it is suspected, antibiotic treatment should be initiated to avoid delay in surgical or transcatheter intervention. In symptomatic patients with prosthetic valve regurgitation, the appropriate management is correction of the underlying valve failure. Even in asymptomatic patients, replacement may be considered because of rapid disease progression. The backward flow of AR can cause systolic dysfunction and decrease in cardiac output. Type 1 CRS is associated with diminished end-organ perfusion secondary to acute decompensated heart failure. Management with inotropic agents can increase kidney perfusion and help improve this condition. In cases of AKI secondary to acute valvular disease, kidney function improves after correction of the underlying structural abnormality.\n\n【109】For a long period of time, the standard practice of valvular reintervention was surgery. Given the drastic increase in the use of bioprosthetic valves and concomitant increase in the requirement of reoperation, less invasive procedures were developed. The transcatheter ViV procedure was first performed in Germany in 2007 for aortic valve replacement. Since then, it has become an attractive alternative for patients who are not candidates for surgery. The updated 2020 ACC/AHA guideline helped elucidate the choice of intervention between surgery or a ViV procedure. It was recommended to begin the evaluation with either TTE or TEE.\n\n【110】2020 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n【111】If the patient is asymptomatic but has severe regurgitation, surgery is recommended (class 2a). In symptomatic patients, the surgical risk should be evaluated to decide the intervention modality. If there is low risk, surgical replacement is strongly recommended (class 1). In patients with high surgical risk or with paravalvular regurgitation, percutaneous repair is reasonable (class 2a). A ViV procedure can be chosen for patients with bioprosthetic valve regurgitation (class 2a).\n\n【112】2020 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n【113】However, the final decision is based on shared decision making between the patient and the medical care team.\n\n【114】Valve-in-valve is a relatively new procedure, and its comprehensive long-term consequences are not fully understood. Nonetheless, the outcomes of current multicenter studies are promising, showing less risk of mortality and morbidity compared with reoperation.\n\n【115】Valve in valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation (ViV-TAVI) versus redo-Surgical aortic valve replacement (redo-SAVR): a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【116】It is also associated with lower rates of paravalvular leak, need for a pacemaker, and annulus rupture compared with transcatheter aortic valve implantation for native aortic valves. Conversely, coronary artery obstruction is the most worrisome concern with aortic ViV procedures. The common mechanism behind it is the previously placed tissue valve leaflets being pushed outward by the new one. This leads to direct contact with coronary ostia or the sinotubular junction. In addition to procedure-dependent factors, patients might have anatomic differences that make them more prone to coronary artery obstruction after a ViV procedure. In order to evaluate for low-lying coronary ostia or narrow sinotubular junction, angiography is performed prior to ViV procedures, although it is not part of routine practice yet.\n\n【117】The follow-up of patients with prosthetic heart valves is defined in AHA/ACC guidelines.\n\n【118】2017 AHA/ACC focused update of the 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n【119】The first outpatient visit should be 6 weeks to 3 months after the procedure. Assessment of the valve function, whether there are signs of infection, conduction abnormalities, and myocardial ischemia/infarction should be the main focus in the first visit. The recommended imaging modality is TTE, which provides information regarding valvular structure and hemodynamics, possible leaks, the size of the ventricles, and systolic function. Afterward, routine follow-up visits should be scheduled annually. If patients have any auscultatory changes on examination or if they become symptomatic (ie, with symptoms of anemia or new-onset heart failure), a diagnostic work-up should be undertaken without waiting for the next appointment. The severity of regurgitation should be evaluated by looking at transvalvular velocities, valve areas, and pressure gradients.\n\n【120】Potential Competing Interests\n-----------------------------\n\n【121】The authors report no competing interests.", "index": 11918, "show": true, "start": 11905, "end": 12177, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【120】Potential Competing Interests\n【121】The authors report no competing interests.", "content": "【0】71-Year-Old Man With a New Heart Murmur\nA 71-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and bicuspid aortic valve endocarditis treated with prosthetic valve replacement in 2012 presented to the internal medicine clinic for his annual physical examination. His home medications included aspirin (81 mg), pantoprazole (40 mg), paroxetine (37.5 mg), rosuvastatin (20 mg), and terazosin (10 mg) daily. Review of systems was notable for increasing exertional and supine shortness of breath. He also reported occasional chest discomfort on the right side with and without exertion.

On physical examination, the patient was a well-appearing man in no acute distress. His skin was warm, and no thyromegaly, cervical adenopathy, carotid bruit, or jugular vein distention was noted. Cardiovascular examination revealed normal rate and regular rhythm; the S <sub>1 </sub> and S <sub>2 </sub> were normal, but a notable grade 2/4 early diastolic decrescendo murmur was detected, most prominently heard over the right second intercostal space.

Murmurs are described by their shape (ie, crescendo, decrescendo, both, or continuous), the timing in systole or diastole, location and pitch, and audible intensity grade. A heart murmur may be benign or indicate valvular or structural abnormalities of the heart. Diastolic murmurs, however, are almost always pathologic.\n\n【15】The most common causes of diastolic murmurs are PR and AR. Pulmonary regurgitation is described as an early decrescendo blowing diastolic murmur. Pulmonary regurgitation is most commonly caused by pulmonary hypertension.\n\n【16】The diastolic murmur of AR tends to be a high-pitched diastolic decrescendo murmur that begins with A <sub>2 </sub> . Its duration in diastole depends on whether the AR is acute or chronic as well as the severity of the regurgitation.\n\n【17】Differentiation of PR murmur from AR can be difficult by auscultation alone. The correlation of the patient’s history with the physical examination plays an important role. The presence of known aortic pathology in this patient makes AR the most likely cause of his diastolic murmur.\n\n【18】The murmur associated with AS tends to be heard over the right second intercostal space. The AS murmur is a harsh systolic ejection murmur and may be transmitted to the carotid arteries. Because the murmur in our patient is diastolic, AS is unlikely.\n\n【19】Mitral stenosis causes a mid-diastolic murmur with an associated rumbling characteristic and an opening snap.

The rigid and round structure of the valve allows better fit and an appropriately positioned valve causing less paravalvular leak. It also provides more consistent anchoring; the risk of annulus rupture is less likely.\n\n【79】One of the most reported ViV procedural concerns compared with initial transcatheter aortic valve replacement is coronary obstruction.\n\n【80】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【81】Valve-in-valve TAVR: state-of-the-art review.\n\n【82】The obstruction is due to the bioprosthetic leaflets being pushed outward by the newly placed transcatheter heart valve. The outward push is caused by the grossly oversized transcatheter heart valve compared with the true internal diameter of the previously placed valve. It yields direct contact with coronary ostia or the sinotubular junction. This potential complication can likewise be due to patient-dependent anatomic factors such as low-lying coronary ostia or narrow sinotubular junction.\n\n【83】To determine preprocedural risks for coronary obstruction, patients undergo coronary angiography before ViV procedures.\n\n【84】Prosthetic valve endocarditis is always a possible concern. However, the reported rates for ViV complications are not as well studied or documented as for coronary artery obstruction.\n\n【85】Postprocedural TTE identified a decline in the left ventricular ejection fraction to 40% with worsened anterior and septal wall motion abnormalities but improvement in the patient’s aortic insufficiency and the replacement valve in the correct location. Subjectively, he felt considerably better than on admission, and he was discharged to home with the addition of lisinopril (2.5 mg daily) and warfarin for 6 months.\n\n【86】*   5.\n\n【87】    **Which _one_ of the following procedures would warrant empirical antibiotic prophylaxis for this patient?**\n\n【88】    *   a.\n\n【89】        Cardiac catheterization\n\n【90】    *   b.\n\n【91】        Colonoscopy with biopsy\n\n【92】    *   c.\n\n【93】        Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\n\n【94】    *   d.\n\n【95】        Bone marrow biopsy\n\n【96】    *   e.\n\n【97】        Bronchoscopy with biopsy\n\n【98】Prosthetic heart valves confer one of the highest risks of complications if infective endocarditis occurs.\n\n【99】Prevention of infective endocarditis: guidelines from the American Heart Association; a guideline from the American Heart Association Rheumatic Fever, Endocarditis, and Kawasaki Disease Committee, Council on Cardiovascular Disease in the Young, and the Council on Clinical Cardiology, Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia, and the Quality of Care and Outcomes Research Interdisciplinary Working Group.\n\n【100】Cardiac surgery, but not cardiac catheterization, would require antibiotic prophylaxis.\n\n【101】Colonoscopies with or without biopsy would not require antibiotic prophylaxis because the risk of bacterial translocation to the prosthetic heart valves is considered low. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is also considered a low-risk procedure that would not necessitate prophylaxis.\n\n【102】Bone marrow biopsies are considered low-risk procedures. However, if there are signs of infected skin or soft tissue above the biopsy site, then antibiotics against _Staphylococcus aureus_ and β-hemolytic streptococci should be administered.\n\n【103】Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended in patients undergoing bronchoscopy with planned biopsy. Patients who have a known respiratory tract infection undergoing this procedure should have empirical treatment guided toward viridans group streptococci.\n\n【104】Repeated TTE 6 months after discharge revealed substantial improvement in the left ventricular systolic function with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 53%.\n\n【105】Discussion\n----------\n\n【106】Bioprosthetic valves are starting to be preferred over mechanical valves because they do not require lifelong anticoagulation, although the traditional recommendations favor the use of mechanical valves in younger patients (<55 years) because they can last longer.\n\n【107】2017 AHA/ACC focused update of the 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n【108】Bioprosthetic valves are prone to structural degeneration and can result in regurgitation, stenosis, or both. Prosthetic valve regurgitation can be symptomatic or asymptomatic depending on the severity, hemodynamics, and provoking factors. The typical auscultatory finding is early diastolic decrescendo murmur with a blowing character that can be heard well on the second right intercostal space and left sternum. Symptomatic patients can present with unexplained or new-onset heart failure or severe hemolysis. In those symptomatic patients, infective endocarditis should be kept in mind and excluded first. If it is suspected, antibiotic treatment should be initiated to avoid delay in surgical or transcatheter intervention. In symptomatic patients with prosthetic valve regurgitation, the appropriate management is correction of the underlying valve failure. Even in asymptomatic patients, replacement may be considered because of rapid disease progression. The backward flow of AR can cause systolic dysfunction and decrease in cardiac output. Type 1 CRS is associated with diminished end-organ perfusion secondary to acute decompensated heart failure. Management with inotropic agents can increase kidney perfusion and help improve this condition. In cases of AKI secondary to acute valvular disease, kidney function improves after correction of the underlying structural abnormality.\n\n【109】For a long period of time, the standard practice of valvular reintervention was surgery. Given the drastic increase in the use of bioprosthetic valves and concomitant increase in the requirement of reoperation, less invasive procedures were developed. The transcatheter ViV procedure was first performed in Germany in 2007 for aortic valve replacement. Since then, it has become an attractive alternative for patients who are not candidates for surgery. The updated 2020 ACC/AHA guideline helped elucidate the choice of intervention between surgery or a ViV procedure. It was recommended to begin the evaluation with either TTE or TEE.\n\n【110】2020 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n【111】If the patient is asymptomatic but has severe regurgitation, surgery is recommended (class 2a). In symptomatic patients, the surgical risk should be evaluated to decide the intervention modality. If there is low risk, surgical replacement is strongly recommended (class 1). In patients with high surgical risk or with paravalvular regurgitation, percutaneous repair is reasonable (class 2a). A ViV procedure can be chosen for patients with bioprosthetic valve regurgitation (class 2a).\n\n【112】2020 ACC/AHA guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n【113】However, the final decision is based on shared decision making between the patient and the medical care team.\n\n【114】Valve-in-valve is a relatively new procedure, and its comprehensive long-term consequences are not fully understood. Nonetheless, the outcomes of current multicenter studies are promising, showing less risk of mortality and morbidity compared with reoperation.\n\n【115】Valve in valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation (ViV-TAVI) versus redo-Surgical aortic valve replacement (redo-SAVR): a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【116】It is also associated with lower rates of paravalvular leak, need for a pacemaker, and annulus rupture compared with transcatheter aortic valve implantation for native aortic valves. Conversely, coronary artery obstruction is the most worrisome concern with aortic ViV procedures. The common mechanism behind it is the previously placed tissue valve leaflets being pushed outward by the new one. This leads to direct contact with coronary ostia or the sinotubular junction. In addition to procedure-dependent factors, patients might have anatomic differences that make them more prone to coronary artery obstruction after a ViV procedure. In order to evaluate for low-lying coronary ostia or narrow sinotubular junction, angiography is performed prior to ViV procedures, although it is not part of routine practice yet.\n\n【117】The follow-up of patients with prosthetic heart valves is defined in AHA/ACC guidelines.\n\n【118】2017 AHA/ACC focused update of the 2014 AHA/ACC guideline for the management of patients with valvular heart disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n【119】The first outpatient visit should be 6 weeks to 3 months after the procedure. Assessment of the valve function, whether there are signs of infection, conduction abnormalities, and myocardial ischemia/infarction should be the main focus in the first visit. The recommended imaging modality is TTE, which provides information regarding valvular structure and hemodynamics, possible leaks, the size of the ventricles, and systolic function. Afterward, routine follow-up visits should be scheduled annually. If patients have any auscultatory changes on examination or if they become symptomatic (ie, with symptoms of anemia or new-onset heart failure), a diagnostic work-up should be undertaken without waiting for the next appointment. The severity of regurgitation should be evaluated by looking at transvalvular velocities, valve areas, and pressure gradients.\n\n【120】Potential Competing Interests\n-----------------------------\n\n【121】The authors report no competing interests.", "index": 22446, "show": true, "start": 22420, "end": 22502, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:22:30", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:24:23", "cost": 113.016}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:37", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:24:23", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:22:29"}

They found that for the same level of total PA, moderate PA (MPA) was associated with delayed mortality, whereas vigorous PA (VPA) was associated with hastened mortality in high levels of PM <sub>10 </sub> . Nonetheless, VPA and MPA were associated with delayed mortality in low to moderate levels of PM <sub>10 </sub> , with VPA offering additional benefit. The findings of this study may provide guidance on the choice between VPA and MPA activity level in older adults, given the environmental exposure of those adults. This is a unique study in that in combines 2 risk factors for CVD (lack of exercise and harmful environmental exposure) and assesses how these 2 factors, when combined, can have an impact on mortality.\n\n【5】It has been well studied that PA and exercise have numerous cardiovascular benefits and, in turn, positive results on mortality in individuals both with and without CVD. Sanchis-Gomar et al\n\n【6】Exercise effects on cardiovascular disease: from basic aspects to clinical evidence.\n\n【7】conducted a comprehensive state-of-the-art review that sought to elucidate the beneficial effects of PA on CVD. They found that regular PA provided benefits in cardiac remodeling, metabolic energy optimization, angiogenesis, protection against ischemia-reperfusion injuries, protection against oxidative stress, and calcium handling. In addition, a review by Franklin et al\n\n【8】reported yet again how increased PA and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with increased survival and decreased CVD events, chronic disease, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality.

Physiologically speaking, exercise induces changes in the body that help in decreasing blood pressure, improving mood disorders, and improving metabolism, all of which reduce the risk for development of CVD and thus improving mortality risk for individuals.\n\n【11】Exposure to harmful particulate matter can increase the risk of CVD and thus negatively affect mortality. Our recent meta-analysis evaluated 18 prospective studies consisting of more than 7 million people who were exposed to increasing levels of PM <sub>2.5 </sub> (particulate matter <2.5 μm in length) and found that exposure to increasing levels of PM <sub>2.5 </sub> was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, CVD, and CVD mortality.\n\n【12】PM2.5 and cardiovascular health risks.\n\n【13】Potential mechanisms for how this occurred included induction of a chronic vascular inflammatory state on inhalation of the particulate matter.\n\n【14】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【15】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【16】Effects of gaseous and solid constituents of air pollution on endothelial function.\n\n【17】Now, Park and colleagues specifically evaluated PM <sub>10 </sub> in their study, but it is no surprise that larger particulate matter would have a similar effect on CVD and overall mortality. A large retrospective cohort study conducted by Zhang et al\n\n【18】Long-term exposure to high particulate matter pollution and cardiovascular mortality: a 12-year cohort study in four cities in northern China.\n\n【19】in China reported how increased PM <sub>10 </sub> levels are associated with increased CVD mortality.

For example, the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend 150 to 300 min/wk of MPA or 75 to 150 min/wk of VPA.\n\n【22】The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.\n\n【23】Similarly, air pollution causes significant mortality on a yearly basis, on the magnitude of millions of people.\n\n【24】This led to the World Health Organization global air quality guideline suggesting that annual average concentration of inhalable PM <sub>10 </sub> should not exceed 15 μg/m.\n\n【25】We applaud Park and colleagues because their research will enable future research and legislation about exercise and environmental exposure to be created with regard to older individuals. Specifically, on the basis of their findings, it seems that MPA and VPA for older adults with access to areas with minimal pollution offer decreased risk of mortality, whereas engaging in VPA in areas with higher levels of pollution seems to result in an increased risk of mortality. In areas of high air pollution, VPA should probably be performed indoors or with effective masking, whereas MPA appeared more universally safe. There is strong evidence backing them about the detrimental effects of increasing levels of particulate matter and strong evidence backing them about the beneficial effects of increasing levels of PA and exercise, especially that increase levels of cardiorespiratory fitness. Going forward, continuing to optimize the level of PA and exercise and an effort to decrease environmental pollution will serve to reduce the mortality risk in the entire population, including in older individuals.

They found that for the same level of total PA, moderate PA (MPA) was associated with delayed mortality, whereas vigorous PA (VPA) was associated with hastened mortality in high levels of PM <sub>10 </sub> . Nonetheless, VPA and MPA were associated with delayed mortality in low to moderate levels of PM <sub>10 </sub> , with VPA offering additional benefit. The findings of this study may provide guidance on the choice between VPA and MPA activity level in older adults, given the environmental exposure of those adults. This is a unique study in that in combines 2 risk factors for CVD (lack of exercise and harmful environmental exposure) and assesses how these 2 factors, when combined, can have an impact on mortality.\n\n【5】It has been well studied that PA and exercise have numerous cardiovascular benefits and, in turn, positive results on mortality in individuals both with and without CVD. Sanchis-Gomar et al\n\n【6】Exercise effects on cardiovascular disease: from basic aspects to clinical evidence.\n\n【7】conducted a comprehensive state-of-the-art review that sought to elucidate the beneficial effects of PA on CVD. They found that regular PA provided benefits in cardiac remodeling, metabolic energy optimization, angiogenesis, protection against ischemia-reperfusion injuries, protection against oxidative stress, and calcium handling. In addition, a review by Franklin et al\n\n【8】reported yet again how increased PA and cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with increased survival and decreased CVD events, chronic disease, CVD mortality, and all-cause mortality. Kim et al\n\n【9】Impact of physical activity on all-cause mortality according to specific cardiovascular disease.\n\n【10】conducted a large cohort study in Korea that sought to evaluate the effect that PA had on mortality in patients with and without CVD; they concluded that PA is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in patients with and without prior CVD. Physiologically speaking, exercise induces changes in the body that help in decreasing blood pressure, improving mood disorders, and improving metabolism, all of which reduce the risk for development of CVD and thus improving mortality risk for individuals.\n\n【11】Exposure to harmful particulate matter can increase the risk of CVD and thus negatively affect mortality. Our recent meta-analysis evaluated 18 prospective studies consisting of more than 7 million people who were exposed to increasing levels of PM <sub>2.5 </sub> (particulate matter <2.5 μm in length) and found that exposure to increasing levels of PM <sub>2.5 </sub> was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality, CVD, and CVD mortality.\n\n【12】PM2.5 and cardiovascular health risks.\n\n【13】Potential mechanisms for how this occurred included induction of a chronic vascular inflammatory state on inhalation of the particulate matter.\n\n【14】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【15】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【16】Effects of gaseous and solid constituents of air pollution on endothelial function.\n\n【17】Now, Park and colleagues specifically evaluated PM <sub>10 </sub> in their study, but it is no surprise that larger particulate matter would have a similar effect on CVD and overall mortality. A large retrospective cohort study conducted by Zhang et al\n\n【18】Long-term exposure to high particulate matter pollution and cardiovascular mortality: a 12-year cohort study in four cities in northern China.\n\n【19】in China reported how increased PM <sub>10 </sub> levels are associated with increased CVD mortality. The suspected pathophysiologic mechanism involved in this process seemed to be systemic inflammation, accelerated atherosclerosis, and altered autonomic cardiac function.\n\n【20】Cardiovascular mortality and long-term exposure to particulate air pollution: epidemiological evidence of general pathophysiological pathways of disease.\n\n【21】Given the beneficial effects of PA and a clean environment, guidelines have been proposed that sought to incorporate these beneficial health effects into everyday life. For example, the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend 150 to 300 min/wk of MPA or 75 to 150 min/wk of VPA.\n\n【22】The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.\n\n【23】Similarly, air pollution causes significant mortality on a yearly basis, on the magnitude of millions of people.\n\n【24】This led to the World Health Organization global air quality guideline suggesting that annual average concentration of inhalable PM <sub>10 </sub> should not exceed 15 μg/m.\n\n【25】We applaud Park and colleagues because their research will enable future research and legislation about exercise and environmental exposure to be created with regard to older individuals. Specifically, on the basis of their findings, it seems that MPA and VPA for older adults with access to areas with minimal pollution offer decreased risk of mortality, whereas engaging in VPA in areas with higher levels of pollution seems to result in an increased risk of mortality. In areas of high air pollution, VPA should probably be performed indoors or with effective masking, whereas MPA appeared more universally safe. There is strong evidence backing them about the detrimental effects of increasing levels of particulate matter and strong evidence backing them about the beneficial effects of increasing levels of PA and exercise, especially that increase levels of cardiorespiratory fitness. Going forward, continuing to optimize the level of PA and exercise and an effort to decrease environmental pollution will serve to reduce the mortality risk in the entire population, including in older individuals.

They contend that “off-label use” does not comport with evidence-based medicine. We would respectfully disagree. Most clinicians would agree that the Food and Drug Administration or European Medicines Agency approval alone does not make a medication more effective. In the spirit of appraising all evidence, both positive and negative, we feel that it is imperative for reviews to include medications that do not have specific approvals but are still used to treat alcohol use disorders. The off-label use of medications is common practice in most specialties, and some off-label medications are even considered first-line treatment for their off-label use.\n\n【2】In fact, it was estimated in a 2006 study that 21% of all medicines prescribed do not have specific indications from regulating agencies for the conditions for which they were used.\n\n【3】That being said, if the intent of Drs Braillon and Naudet is to discredit off-label medication use in general, this would not be the appropriate environment as it is in no way specific to our article and they should consider constructing an original, larger, peer-reviewed article arguing their point.\n\n【4】Regarding the 2 examples that the authors articulate to conclude that these pharmacotherapies are not evidence based, we do reference some of the problems associated with the approval for nalmefene and acknowledge that the data were retrospectively assessed. Regarding baclofen, we reference the recent Cochrane review that was negative. Regarding the level of evidence of these studies, the sources we cited were a meta-analysis consisting of 5 randomized controlled trials for namefene\n\n【5】Weak evidence on nalmefene creates dilemmas for clinicians and poses questions for regulators and researchers.\n\n【6】and a meta-analysis consisting of 13 randomized controlled trials for baclofen.\n\n【7】In the spirit of evidence-based medicine, it would be irresponsible to neglect these data.

Although we acknowledge that complete abstinence may be an ideal outcome, we should not dismiss whatever degrees of improvement that can be achieved. It seems self-evident that a reduction in drinking, even minimal, could have a significant effect on the morbidity of the patient. As is the case in many chronic conditions, improved quality of life is not a negligible outcome.

His mother, Dolores García, was from Cerro de Pasco and had a liaison with Baltasar during a trip he took to that city. Although Baltasar was married to another woman back in Ecuador, he eventually accepted paternity of Daniel and provided for the boy. Baltasar died from a gun accident while riding a rambunctious horse when Daniel was 8 years old, and young Daniel was then sent away to live with relatives of his mother. At the age of 14, he moved to the city of Lima and entered the Colegio de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe. He began studying at Faculty of Medicine of the Universidad Mayor de San Marcos in Lima in 1878, but difficult economic conditions resulting from the 1879-1883 War of the Pacific (involving Peru, Chile, and Bolivia) and study interruptions for military service meant that his progress was slow.\n\n【2】In 1875, a severe febrile illness associated with hemolytic anemia had delayed construction of a critical rail line from the coastal city of Callao (near Lima) to the mining town of La Oroya in the Altiplano (Andean Plateau) in central Peru. Hundreds of railroad workers died from what soon became known as “Oroya fever,” and it became a national priority to understand this ailment. Although several contemporary medical experts suspected a link to a peculiar cutaneous malady seen in the same region, “Peruvian warts” – _verruga peruana_ , an endemic yet not contagious ailment that had been recognized since pre-Inca times – there was no direct proof of a connection.\n\n【3】Carrión was required to prepare a thesis to graduate from medical school, and he decided to study verruga peruana, which he had first encountered as a boy in Cerro de Pasco. Realizing that the key unanswered question about the disease was whether it was linked to Oroya fever (and perhaps wanting to achieve some notoriety at the outset of his career to help overcome his lack of money or political connections), he begged his supervisors at the Hospital Dos de Mayo in Lima to inoculate him with tissue from a skin lesion of an affected patient. His supervisors adamantly refused, so on August 27, 1885, Carrión took matters into his own hands. He used a lancet to scrape material from a bright red, active verruca located near the eyebrows of a 14-year-old boy at the hospital who had recovered from an illness and was about to be discharged (history records both the boy's name, Carmen Paredes, as well as the ward bed he was in, Numero 5). Because Carrión had difficulty inoculating his own arms with the material from Paredes' skin lesion, several of his friends, including a young physician named Evaristo Chavez, took the lancet from him and made 4 inoculations, 2 in each of Carrión's arms. Carrión then took detailed notes on the evolution of his condition.\n\n【4】Although he noticed some brief itching at the inoculation sites the day after the injection, Carrión experienced no further symptoms until 3 weeks later. On September 17, he developed some pain in his left ankle, which resolved the next day, but 2 days later he came down with cramps, fevers, chills, and headaches. By September 22, he was very ill: jaundiced and pale, with dark-colored urine consistent with brisk hemolysis. From September 26 he was too weak to continue to take notes on his own, so his friends continued his research project even as they were also attending to him at the bedside. Carrión's condition deteriorated further, and he was admitted at the end of September to Maison de Santé (the French Hospital in Lima), where he was treated with iron salts, quinine, and oxygen. The day before his death, a blood transfusion was authorized by a hospital committee (transfusions were considered extremely dangerous in the era, 15 years before Karl Landsteiner discovered blood types, and were only used in desperate cases), but Carrión died before any blood could be administered. He is buried in a mausoleum on the premises of the National Hospital Dos de Mayo in Lima. There was a brief attempt to prosecute his friends, including Dr. Chavez, as accessories to murder, but the legal case quickly fell apart owing to overwhelming public sentiment. A Peruvian law later declared him officially a “National Hero,” and Oroya fever became known as “Carrión's disease.”\n\n【5】The geographic distribution of Carrión's disease is limited to Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia, and it is encountered primarily in Andean valleys at an altitude between 500 and 3000 meters. Subsequent investigations demonstrated that the disease is caused by _Bartonella bacilliformis_ gram-negative bacteria, which are transmitted by sandflies of the genus _Lutzomyia_ . Salmonella superinfection complicated many of the cases historically, and superinfection increases lethality. The disease remains endemic in some rural areas of Peru; an outbreak occurred as recently as 1998, with a mortality rate of less than 1%, compared with 40% to 90% in the era before effective antibiotic treatment. The organism was first observed on a blood smear in 1909 by Alberto Leonardo Barton Thompson, an Argentian-born Peruvian researcher who gave his name to the bacterial genus. A Japanese investigator, Hideyo Noguchi, flew blood to New York from a patient who died of Oroya fever in Lima in 1926 and was the first to successfully culture the organism and inoculate the bacillus into primates, which resulted in verruga peruana.\n\n【6】Today, Daniel Carrión is recognized both for his risk-taking altruism and as a model of the tradition of medical self-experimentation. Self-experimentation usually occurs when skeptical research authorities deny permission for a risky procedure that an individual investigator feels has a high likelihood of success, as in Carrión's case, or when an experiment is considered too dangerous to ethically perform on someone else. For instance, the first person who German physician Werner Forssman performed a cardiac catheterization on in 1929 was himself, after his department chief refused permission to try the procedure on patients, and US Army physicians from Walter Reed's yellow fever research team in 1900 inoculated themselves intentionally to prove that the disease was mosquito-borne, resulting in death of one young team member, Jesse Lazear. In other self-experimentation cases, the physician is simply the most convenient research subject. Jonas Salk tested his polio vaccine on both himself and his family in the 1950s, while Barry Marshall swallowed the contents of a Petri dish containing cultured _Helicobacter pylori_ in 1984 after experiments with the organisms in piglets failed. In 1950, William Harrington injected himself with 500 mL of blood from a patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura to prove the condition was serologically transmitted (and he suffered a seizure as a result), while Joseph Goldberger in 1914 injected himself with blood from a patient with pellagra (niacin deficiency) to prove that it was not an infectious disease. In the early 17 <sup>th </sup> century, Santorio of Padua lived on a platform scale for 30 years, to carefully measure his weight, oral intake, and his urine and stools, and thereby demonstrated the concept of “insensible losses” via perspiration.

Protocols for duration of manual or mechanical compression, use of arterial closure devices, and time to ambulation after sheath removal vary widely across catheterization centers. Data are insufficient to construct universal guidelines to minimize vascular complications and patient discomfort while improving efficiency in the catheterization laboratory and potentially reducing costs.\n\n【17】report a well-done and clinically relevant study of 1005 patients (1009 procedures) undergoing left heart catheterization via femoral access in which 5F catheter systems were used. After 10 to 15 minutes of manual pressure to achieve hemostasis, a protocol consisting of 1 hour of bed rest was followed after the procedure, allowing for ambulation as early as 1 hour after catheterization in the absence of complications. In this protocol, a patient was observed while walking 100 feet and then assessed by a nurse. If the patient had no problems and the access site remained stable, the patient walked another 100 feet. After successful ambulation, patients were observed for an additional 60 minutes before dismissal from the hospital. In addition, a contact telephone number was provided to patients for use in the event of complications occurring after hospital discharge. Overall procedural success, defined as achieving successful hemostasis, patient ambulation within 60 minutes, and dismissal from the hospital without complications, was achieved in 975 procedures (97%). The authors report a remarkably low incidence of major (0.1%) and minor (3.3%) complications with the use of this protocol. The single major complication consisted of a patient who was noted to have a large (5 cm) hematoma at the access site approximately 1 hour after initial ambulation. Most minor complications consisted of small (<4 cm) hematoma formation at the access site (1.4%) or rebleeding (1.9%). Most cases of rebleeding occurred during bed rest (0.6%) or during ambulation (1.1%), and only 2 patients (0.2%) had evidence of rebleeding during the observation period after ambulation. No patients in this study required blood transfusion or surgical repair of the arterial access site, and no instances of retroperitoneal bleeding, arteriovenous fistula, pseudoaneurysm, arterial occlusion, or infection were observed.\n\n【18】It is important to address several issues that may affect the applicability of the protocol used at Mayo Clinic to other catheterization centers. Of note, the execution of a protocol such as that described by Doyle et al is largely dependent on the skill and training of the catheterization laboratory nursing staff and ancillary personnel. The success of this protocol at Mayo Clinic speaks to the exceptional level of nursing at that institution, and caution should be used in generalizing these data to other catheterization centers. The availability of nursing resources and the ability of the catheterization laboratory staff to undergo effective training in achieving hemostasis with manual compression may be important factors in allowing other centers to use a similar protocol. In addition to the in-hospital care, the provision of a telephone contact for patients to report complications represents another staffing issue. It was unclear from the article how many study patients experienced delayed complications resulting in contact through the telephone hotline; however, it should be noted that all centers may not have the resources to establish such a protocol. One factor that has increased the use of mechanical compression devices and arterial closure devices has been the shortage in trained nursing staff at many centers. If adequate personnel are available, the procedure room may be “turned over” while 1 person holds manual pressure; however, at centers with nursing shortages, it may not be feasible for nurses or technicians to maintain manual pressure after procedures because this may delay room turnover and decrease catheterization laboratory throughput.\n\n【19】Despite the overall success of the described protocol, some limitations must be acknowledged. Given that most patients in the study did not undergo anticoagulation at the time of the procedure, the results should not be applied to patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention treated with high-dose anticoagulation or patients undergoing anticoagulation for other indications. Furthermore, these data should not be applied to patients undergoing left heart catheterization with larger sheath sizes, which might increase the risk of bleeding complications. Caution must be used in other groups of patients who are otherwise at high risk for bleeding, including those with peripheral arterial disease in whom the femoral artery may be less easily compressed\n\n【20】and those with uncontrolled hypertension. Finally, as routine ultrasound examination of the arterial access site was not required as a part of this protocol, it is possible that the reported incidence of pseudoaneurysm and arteriovenous fistula formation was slightly underestimated.\n\n【21】In summary, the article by Doyle et al represents an important contribution to the existing data regarding early patient ambulation after diagnostic left heart catheterization from the femoral artery. The authors describe a protocol for manual compression after sheath removal and ambulation after 1 hour of bed rest in the absence of complications. The authors report an extremely low incidence of vascular complications with the use of this protocol, and the potential benefits in patient comfort, hospital cost, and catheterization laboratory throughput are substantial. Interestingly, one wonders if this protocol could safely be made even shorter by decreasing the duration of the observation period after ambulation, given the extremely low incidence of rebleeding complications during that time (0.2%). Further prospective studies are necessary to establish the safety of such a protocol in a community setting as well as in patients with a higher risk of bleeding, such as those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. As a consequence of the study by Doyle et al, future randomized trials of vascular closure devices now have a new bench-mark—one that will not be easy to achieve. Potentially, a protocol using smaller sheath sizes, close observation, and early ambulation after manual compression of the femoral artery represents a viable method for ensuring patient safety while improving patient comfort, reducing costs, and improving efficiency in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:28:54", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:29:38", "cost": 44.095}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:37", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:29:38", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:28:54"}

The first issue they raised was the safety and tolerability of etoricoxib with respect to low-dose aspirin users and nonusers. This study was not of sufficient size to specifically evaluate gastrointestinal (GI) safety and tolerability in the context of aspirin use. Although the treatment groups were balanced with respect to the proportion of aspirin users, they constituted only about 22% of the enrolled patient population. Furthermore, there were no reported upper GI bleeding events in this study. Currently available clinical data suggest that aspirin increases the risk of upper GI events in patients treated with either selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors or nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but data that address the effect of aspirin on relative risk are limited. Therefore, we agree that additional clinical data are needed to adequately assess the safety of selective cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors, including etoricoxib and nonselective NSAIDs, in the context of aspirin use.\n\n【1】The conclusion that etoricoxib was well tolerated compared with placebo and ibuprofen over a 12-week period is justified in the context of this study.

At the Mayo Clinic, all staff are salaried, and all medically related intellectual property from the staff belongs to the clinic. Hence, it was necessary to develop a policy for institutional conflict of interest to complement the policy for individual conflicts of interest. This article addresses the principles and process that led to the development of the Mayo Clinic's policies that guide the management of conflict of interest of individuals and of the institution. Empowered by the Bayh-Dole Act, the Mayo Clinic participates in technology transfer through its entity Mayo Medical Ventures. Individual conflicts of interest arising from such technology transfer are associated with institutional conflicts because all individual intellectual property belongs to the institution, per clinic policy. This policy addresses conflicts of interest that arise in research, leadership, clinical practice, investments, and purchasing. Associated with the statutory annual disclosure on personal consulting and other relationships with industry, which are guided by federal regulations, all research protocols or grant applications require financial disclosure on initial submission and in annual progress reports. The clinic's Conflict of Interest Review Board was established to review each disclosure and recommend management of individual and institutional conflicts of interest according to policy.\n\n【1】The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 added a new dimension to the goals of scientific research as it sought to stimulate the translation of American scientific discovery to successful commercial activity. This translation has resulted in patients benefiting from more rapid access to new discoveries. Essentially, the Bayh-Dole Act enabled institutions and their investigators to own patents resulting from federally funded research. Moreover, it enhanced opportunities for funding research activities at academic medical centers at a time when reimbursement from the practice of medicine was dwindling. For the first time, institutions were permitted to hold intellectual property rights for inventions disclosed by employees, to license technology to commercial partners, and to share in a royalty stream with the inventor(s).\n\n【2】The Bayh-Dole Act provided opportunity for the research community to commercialize discovery and innovation. However, it also created inherent conflicts of interest for academic centers engaging in research and technology development with industry. New institutional relationships with industry evolved and extended beyond funded research into strategic alliances, technology licensing, project partnering, and equipment procurement and testing. When these relationships were created, the risk associated with the introduction of bias in the conduct of studies was potentially increased. For individuals, opportunities for closer relationships with industry also expanded with invitations to provide consulting services and to serve on advisory boards or even corporate boards of directors. Conflicts of interest and the potential for conflict were inevitable, as documented in several scholarly reviews and editorials.\n\n【3】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【4】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【5】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【6】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【7】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【8】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【9】Managing conflicts of interest in the conduct of clinical trials.\n\n【10】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【11】Such conflicts became particularly concerning if they were perceived to influence the conduct of trials involving human subjects in which patient safety should have been the principal concern.\n\n【12】Advances in biomedical research originate from both academic institutions and industry. Translation of these innovations to clinical practice involves collaborations that, of necessity, engender formal relationships between industry and academic centers. Public trust in medical research assumes altruistic motives of academic centers and medical researchers in the conduct of contracts with industry. In 1995, formalizing years of intense self-examination and self-regulation within the research community, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Health and Human Services adopted regulations to address individual conflicts of interest. Most state laws also require that tax-exempt entities advance new knowledge in the public interest or risk losing their tax exemption. The key principles for protecting the research participant in the context of individual investigator conflicts of interest were identified initially as disclosure and informed consent. However, management of these conflicts has become more complex with the emergence of institutional conflicts of interest and the intertwining of conflicts of interest for individual investigators and their institutions.\n\n【13】On one extreme, conflicts of interest could be managed by prohibiting contracts and interaction with industry\n\n【14】 on the other extreme, institutions could simply avoid the issue entirely or give it minimal attention. Both alternatives appear unfavorable to the public good; thus, measures must be devised to facilitate appropriate relationships that positively affect patient care. Existing policies governing conflict of interest at academic centers throughout the United States reflect a lack of consistency, according to surveys.\n\n【15】A national survey of policies on disclosure of conflicts of interest in biomedical research.\n\n【16】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【17】Authors have recently recommended measures to be considered by institutions for managing conflicts of interest,\n\n【18】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【19】but as yet there are no published policies from academic medical centers. Moreover, policies for employment and intellectual property at the Mayo Clinic required the development of customized approaches to individual and institutional conflicts of interest. Specifically, it is worth noting that all Mayo Clinic staff are salaried and that all medically related intellectual property of the staff belongs to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n【20】THE NEED FOR AN INSTITUTIONAL POLICY\n------------------------------------\n\n【21】Conflict of interest, even the appearance of potential conflict, has always been a concern for scientists committed to the integrity of their research. In 1921, Dr William J. Mayo stated, “Commercialism in medicine never leads to true satisfaction, and to maintain our self-respect is more precious than gold.” Early in its history, the Mayo Clinic developed policies to help individuals manage conflict of interest. The clinic has considered management of conflict of interest as the responsibility of the institution because all physician/scientist staff work as full-time employees and all intellectual property belongs ultimately to the clinic.\n\n【22】Studies show that patients involved with research projects are more aware of potential individual conflict of interest than of institutional conflict of interest.\n\n【23】Comprehensive studies published in the past 3 years indicate that the potential for institutional conflicts of interest is germane to most if not all academic medical centers\n\n【24】including the National Institutes of Health.\n\n【25】Relationships among physicians/scientists and their institutions and industry also require careful management to avoid legal liabilities.\n\n【26】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【27】Conflicts of interest for the Mayo Clinic as an institution are linked almost exclusively to individual conflicts of interest. Therefore, we acknowledge that our recommendations may not apply to conflicts of interest at all medical centers. However, we believe our deliberations may serve to stimulate discussion at other medical centers and may lead eventually to a consensus position for the academic medical community as a whole.\n\n【28】THE PROCESS LEADING TO THE MAYO CLINIC'S POLICY ON CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【29】Through ongoing communications with staff, the Mayo Clinic has noted the staff's sense of responsibility for conflict of interest, but also their confusion regarding what actually constitutes conflict of interest and how that conflict can be managed. Some Mayo Clinic staff perceived that a potential conflict of interest was associated with a presumption of wrongdoing. This illustrated a need to educate the staff about the inevitability of conflicts of interest and the importance of establishing standards and effective mechanisms to manage it.\n\n【30】Most guidelines in prior publications tended to address conflicts of interest related to clinical trials; however, relationships with industry encompass other everyday functions of academic medical or research centers. Dr David Korn,\n\n【31】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【32】Division of Biomedical and Health Sciences Research, Association of American Medical Colleges, stated, “Conflicts of interest are ubiquitous and inevitable in academic life, indeed, in all professional life. The challenge for academic medicine is not to eradicate them, which is fanciful and would be inimical to public policy goals, but to recognize and manage them sensibly and effectively.” Improprieties have been reported at academic medical centers where institutional and individual conflicts of interest were not disclosed, reviewed, or managed.\n\n【33】Thus, the Mayo Clinic established a broad-based task force and intramural review process to develop recommended procedures and policies for handling conflicts of interest for individuals and for the institution. The clinic also sought guidance from national leaders, hosted a national forum to air major issues,\n\n【34】Conflict of interest.\n\n【35】and reviewed recommendations from learned individuals.\n\n【36】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【37】Nonfinancial conflicts of interest that may affect individual fame rather than fortune\n\n【38】also were recognized but were not addressed in the first policy because academic self-interest was considered a legitimate part of the motivation to conduct research, which is itself a mandate for academics and their institutions.\n\n【39】GOALS\n-----\n\n【40】DEFINITION OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST AT THE MAYO CLINIC\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Mayo Clinic policy focuses on 4 types of activities that have the potential for financial conflict of interest: purchasing decisions, leadership activities (intramural, including decisions made in the clinical practice, and extramural), investments (endowment and pension fund), and research _._ Because individual and institutional conflicts of interest at the Mayo Clinic often are intertwined, the potential for both is considered for all 4 types of activities.\n\n【42】The operational definition of _conflict of interest_ is as follows :\n\n【43】A conflict of interest occurs when there is a divergence between an individual's or an institution's private interests and their professional obligations either to a patient or to society such that an independent observer might reasonably question whether actions taken by the individual or the institution may have been influenced by consideration of significant financial conflict of interest. A conflict of interest may pertain to research, investment, leadership or purchasing activities; it depends on the situation, and does not necessarily reflect on the character or actions of an individual _._\n\n【44】From the principles outlined in this definition, guidelines were developed for managing potential conflicts of interest in purchasing, leadership, investment, and research activities. Disclosures provide sufficient information to assess relationships with external entities in matters pertinent to the proposed activity. Elements of essential disclosures are listed in Table 1 . Such disclosures do not imply unmanageable conflicts of interest.\n\n【45】TABLE 1 Essential Disclosures\n\n| Corporate equity in the form of stock or other ownershipRoyalties or rights to receive future royalties on licensed intellectual propertyConsulting fees, honoraria, salary, gifts, or in-kind compensation within the previous 12 monthsResearch or education grants within the previous 12 monthsService on advisory boards or boards of directors within the previous 12 monthsCurrent negotiations relating to any of the above relationshipsAny other relevant external relationships that could influence the proposed activity |\n| --- |\n\n【47】Significant financial interest must be defined for each specific activity. General principles that reflect federal guidelines for significant conflict of interest\n\n【48】are listed in Table 2 .\n\n【49】TABLE 2 Significant Conflict of Interest\n\n| Equity greater than 5% in a company or equity with a value of more than $10,000 (whichever is less) is considered a significant financial interest. Equity through mutual funds is not considered a significant financial interestRights to receive royalty payments greater than $10,000 per year on licensed intellectual property are considered a significant financial interestConsulting fees, honoraria, salaries, gifts, or in-kind compensation within the previous 12 months are considered a significant financial interest if value is greater than $10,000Research or education grants within the past 12 months that are unrestricted or provide funds in excess of those required for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of the sponsored research or educational activity are considered a significant financial interestCurrent negotiations to initiate or modify the above relationships are generally regarded as equivalent to a significant financial interest |\n| --- |\n\n【51】GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【52】There are multiple mechanisms for managing conflict of interest. The first step is always disclosure. Since 2001, the Mayo Clinic has mandated annual disclosure by its staff of all relationships with industry. A statement is signed at the time of employment, and failure to comply is reported to the Mayo Clinic Personnel Committee for disciplinary action. With such an honor system in place, there is no attempt to review individual tax returns. In addition, disclosures are updated with each Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB) or federal grant application. Apart from disclosure, current Mayo Clinic policies have discouraged the development of significant financial conflict of interest by requiring peer review of all external consulting relationships, prohibiting stock options as payment for consulting fees, and prohibiting ownership by the professional staff of medically related companies. The second step is evaluation or review of the disclosed information by the Conflict of Interest Review Board to determine whether a significant conflict of interest is present, according to established criteria. If a conflict of interest situation is identified, the third step is to institute measures for conflict management. Management of conflict of interest includes disclosure to patients and laboratory personnel, including graduate students; disclosure in publications and presentations; recusal from the principal investigator position and/or access to data management when indicated; escrow of financial holdings; and rarely, divestiture.\n\n【53】### Purchasing Decisions\n\n【54】In a large academic medical center, purchasing departments often make quality and price-driven decisions removed from the individual user. However, with many technologies or devices, the user of the technology with the best knowledge is often the investigator who invented it or may be funded to study it. Purchasing decisions include but are not restricted to the decision to actually purchase a product or technology (ie, the request that a purchase order be generated); the selection of a supplier for a product or technology for evaluation, competitive bid, or proposal; and the actual negotiation of a purchasing agreement or contract with a supplier of a product or technology. Individuals who serve on advisory boards or boards of directors of vendors or competing vendors being considered in the purchase are said to have a significant interest, even if no compensation is involved.\n\n【55】For purchasing decisions, if a significant conflict of interest is identified after review by the Conflict of Interest Review Board, management of the conflict of interest may require the following: full disclosure of potential conflicts of interest at the time of purchase discussions; recusal from chairing or, depending on the level of conflict of interest, participating in a decision-making process; retention of any equity ownership until research or purchasing decisions are completed; and documentation of the recusal in meeting or purchase decision minutes. The policy also requires that any purchasing decisions involving sums greater than $30,000 and institutional conflict of interest must be reviewed by the Conflict of Interest Review Board. Purchases that involve technologies discovered and licensed originally by the Mayo Clinic to a third party require documentation that the purchase was based on the best interests of the patient, such as documentation of best performance in the literature relative to competing technology. According to Stark II legislation, the inventors earn no royalty when the technology is used at the Mayo Clinic. However, the Mayo Clinic benefits if a sales-based royalty is received.\n\n【56】### Leadership Decisions\n\n【57】For leadership decisions made by any employee on behalf of the Mayo Clinic, management of significant conflict of interest may require the following: recusal from chairing or participating in the final decision-making process that could indirectly affect the relationship of the person with the company or its competitors and the Mayo Clinic, as well as documentation of the recusal in the meeting minutes that record the leadership decision. The process of recruiting staff to the Mayo Clinic is not influenced by the potential to develop intellectual property for income; rather, search committees consist of academic and clinical leaders and have no representation from the Office of Technology Transfer. Incoming staff who own medically related companies are required to disclose all equity and intellectual property before employment, and their potential for conflicts of interest or commitment are monitored by an independent oversight committee at least twice each year.\n\n【58】For leadership decisions made by non-staff members of the Mayo Clinic (eg, members of the clinic's Board of Trustees), recusal from final decision-making processes may be required whenever a personal or potential conflict of interest could directly or indirectly affect the clinic. Recusal is documented in the institutional minutes that summarize the decision.\n\n【59】### Investment Decisions\n\n【60】Mayo Clinic investment decisions should continue to reflect the ethical and responsible stewardship of endowment, pension, and operational funds. Investment decisions should be unrelated to any clinical practice, research, or education activity.\n\n【61】For investment decisions made on behalf of the Mayo Clinic, the conflict of interest policy specifies that the clinic should limit its equity holding to 5% or less in any publicly traded company when the clinic intends to pursue research or educational activities with that company. The Mayo Clinic has no limit to investment/equity ownership when there is no intention to pursue research or educational activities with a company. Similarly, the clinic has no limit to equity ownership in privately held companies (including those that become publicly traded through an initial public offering) that use the clinic's intellectual property when no research is planned with clinic patients or staff. However, if research activities sponsored by a privately held company are contemplated, the relationship and research activity should be reviewed by the IRB to ensure patient safety and by the Conflict of Interest Review Board to manage potential institutional conflict of interest if a Mayo Clinic investment is ongoing or contemplated.\n\n【62】### Research Decisions\n\n【63】The literature is replete with examples of societal concerns about potential conflicts of interest with research results\n\n【64】and the focus on problems in postmarketing surveillance,\n\n【65】interpretation of risk-benefit, and the motivation for profit in the pharmaceutical and device industry. Participation of Mayo Clinic staff in Food and Drug Administration advisory review boards is encouraged. Participation in presentations for new drug or device applications is permitted, although it requires thorough review by the Medical Industry Relations Committee, which also appraises individual and institutional conflicts of interest in each request for participation. Clinical research involving new medications and devices that originate usually in the corporate world is encouraged.\n\n【66】For research decisions, if the Conflict of Interest Review Board identifies a significant conflict of interest after review, oversight or possible recusal from research activities may be required, depending on the level of conflict of interest and its potential effect on human studies. When there is institutional conflict of interest pertaining to research being conducted at the Mayo Clinic, this likely involves individual conflict of interest because all Mayo Clinic employees are required to disclose and license any intellectual property through the clinic's Office of Technology Transfer. With the current royalty-sharing policy, the share received by inventors and their research program or department actually exceeds the royalty received by the general fund of the Mayo Clinic. Hence, institutional conflict of interest can be identified and managed pari passu with the identification of individual conflict of interest. Apart from the share of the inventors, such funds are used to support the research and education missions of the inventors’ research program or department.\n\n【67】Research by or at the Mayo Clinic involving human subjects or biospecimens and all research requiring IRB approval require higher levels of management than does nonhuman research if conflict of interest exists. When research involves individual or institutional financial conflict of interest, the Conflict of Interest Review Board should be consulted for advice. Typically, financial conflict of interest is determined by virtue of assigned monetary value (that is, market value) or licensing of a technology and not just disclosure to the Mayo Clinic's Office of Technology Transfer (Mayo Medical Ventures). Pursuit of a patent is not a formal assignment of monetary value, but it presents the potential for bias; therefore, the Conflict of Interest Review Board may need to develop management strategies in this situation.\n\n【68】In general, basic research should be permitted to continue at the laboratory of the investigator who may have a conflict of interest, depending on the nature of the work, the specific expertise available, and the mandate of the Bayh-Dole Act. Management of conflict of interest in such situations will include disclosure to laboratory personnel, disclosure in presentation and publication of data in scientific journals, and disclosure at the point of application for Public Health Service and/or National Science Foundation Non-Clinical Research Funding (PHS Final Rule 42 CFR Part 50 and 45 CFR Part 94; NSF Rule 59 FR 3308 and 60 FR 35820). Management of the conflict of interest will be reevaluated when the discovery leads to studies in humans or their medical records or in biospecimens that would require approval by the IRB. Because there is a potential for conflict of interest or a potential for the perception of such a conflict when research results emanate from a laboratory with substantial financial interest, several management guidelines are discussed in the next section.\n\n【69】OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST REVIEW BOARD\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【70】Practical guidance for the implementation of review and decision processes was developed for specific situations that arise commonly in the context of research at the Mayo Clinic, as indicated subsequently. This is regarded as work in progress that likely will be refined over time. The Conflict of Interest Review Board, which includes intramural and extramural members, has a direct relationship to Mayo Clinic leadership for matters related to individual conflict of interest. In matters pertaining to institutional conflict of interest, this board reports only to the highest governance body at the clinic, the Board of Trustees, made up primarily of public members. The Conflict of Interest Review Board communicates to the Personnel Committee leadership at the Mayo Clinic regarding any situations in which policies and procedures for conflict of interest have not been followed by its staff. The Personnel Committee serves as the disciplinary board.\n\n【71】Mayo Clinic guidelines anticipate that different levels of conflict of interest may arise that require a tailored or specific management response by the Conflict of Interest Review Board. Research studies that may involve conflict of interest include single-center or multicenter studies with or without Mayo Clinic equity ownership. Simple disclosure of inventions or intellectual property to the Office of Technology Transfer does not necessarily constitute a conflict of interest. The presence of significant financial conflict of interest may require 1 or more management strategies that range from disclosure in the consent form to recusal from participation.\n\n【72】The Mayo Clinic's policy for ownership of its staff's intellectual property facilitates oversight because all technology transfer and start-up companies are coordinated ultimately through 1 office, Mayo Medical Ventures, whose officers are well aware of the policy. Similarly, the policy that prohibits independent staff ownership of a medically related company (whether clinical facilities\n\n【73】or biotechnology-based) reduces the risk of undisclosed conflicts. Such policies may not apply at other academic medical centers. In practice, most institutional conflicts of interest at the Mayo Clinic are identified during the review of individual conflict of interest disclosures, and management strategies can be recommended at the same review.\n\n【74】For multicenter research studies for which neither the Mayo Clinic nor the investigator has a conflict of interest, Mayo Clinic participation and leadership in the study are strongly encouraged with the usual need for IRB review of human studies. However, when single-center or multicenter research studies involve the investigator and the Mayo Clinic and both have a conflict of interest, participation increases the potential of perceived bias in the conduct of the research or a perceived inability to serve the best interests of research participants. In these circumstances, apart from IRB approval, Conflict of Interest Review Board assessment is needed to determine whether the research may be pursued at the Mayo Clinic and whether the investigator may participate. In some situations, addressed in other reports as the “rebuttable presumption,” it may still be appropriate to pursue the research at the academic medical center that has a conflict of interest.\n\n【75】These situations may include the uniqueness of the patient population or expertise or facilities that cannot be replicated at other medical centers. However, in such situations, safeguards have been developed in conjunction with the Mayo Clinic IRB to protect the research participant . Under certain circumstances, it may be permissible to enroll more than 20% of participants in such a study at the Mayo Clinic, as in early clinical studies (phase 1b or 2a studies) or when the novel diagnostic or therapeutic procedure is only available at a few medical centers.\n\n【76】TABLE 3 Precautions for Participation in Research When Investigator and/or Institution Has Significant Financial Conflict of Interest\n\n| Study development is made by a steering committee consisting of Mayo Clinic (investigator) and non-Mayo Clinic members (including plans for design, conduct, and analysis)Mayo Clinic enrolls less than 20% of total participantsConflicted investigator may not participate in operational aspects of study, may not enroll patients or gain informed consent, and cannot be site (Mayo Clinic) principal investigatorInformed consent must be obtained by a nonconflicted investigator who has no access to the dataStudy must be a triple-blind design: patients, investigators, assistants/technicians must be unaware of randomization groups (if appropriate) and resultsData management activities may not occur at investigator institution (Mayo Clinic)There must be an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board and Clinical Event Committee with a priori stopping rules for both safety and efficacyCentral core laboratory must be used when using surrogate end points for efficacyDataset must be given to an independent statistician for comparison at the end of the studyData analysis and interpretation monitoring committee must review any journal or regulatory reportsIndividual or institutional conflict of interest must be disclosed to all study participants in informed consent, and to all study coinvestigators, fellows, and students working on the project |\n| --- |\n\n【78】CONSIDERATION OF OTHER RECENTLY PUBLISHED RECOMMENDATIONS\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【79】Recently published articles in the _New England Journal of Medicine_\n\n【80】and the _Journal of the American Medical Association_\n\n【81】have proposed 4 important principles, which have been adopted by Mayo Clinic.\n\n【82】First, institutions and institutional decision makers should fully disclose industry-related financial interests and relationships and should divest themselves from these interests or recuse themselves from responsibility for research oversight or conduct of research, consistent with the draft recommendations from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n【83】Second, certain facilities should be physically separated, and sharing of information should be restricted between investment (including endowment and pension funds) and research staffs.\n\n【84】Third, oversight should be provided by independent review panels with expertise in intellectual property, finance, and research, and with no financial or other dependence on the institution.\n\n【85】The Mayo Clinic Conflict of Interest Review Board includes external members. However, a body entirely comprising external members was considered unlikely to have sufficient understanding of the mission and governance of the institution and its relationships with industry to serve the needs of the institution or of society in general.\n\n【86】Fourth, there should be greater oversight of research involving human participants and the operation of IRB review and systematic assessment of the outcomes of that oversight.\n\n【87】Oversight of human participants research: identifying problems to evaluate reform proposals.\n\n【88】The chair of the Mayo Clinic's IRB serves as a member of the Conflict of Interest Review Board, and the secretaries of the 2 boards coordinate a group of administrators from the Mayo Clinic's Research Services Department and the Office of Compliance. Mayo Clinic policy requires an annual progress report of each protocol for extension of initial IRB approval, which is for 1 year. The progress report requires disclosure of any change in financial interest of each investigator listed on the protocol. The clinic's internal audit office performs audits of randomly selected active research protocols.\n\n【89】CONCLUSIONS\n-----------\n\n【90】Blumenthal\n\n【91】has written, “Relationships between academic institutions and industry in the life sciences continue to fascinate, perplex, trouble, and embarrass academic investigators, university administrators, industrial companies, and government policymakers.” However, the common good of patients requires that the Mayo Clinic and its staff participate fully in the biomedical research arena and in the translation of new discoveries to clinical application. The Mayo Clinic's conflict of interest policies regarding purchasing, leadership, investment, and research have been established to allow the relationships to go forward yet still protect the patient, the individual, and the institution. The Mayo Clinic has used monetary values consistent with 1995 Public Health Service regulations to define significant financial conflicts.

Physical activity levels were converted into metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) per week and categorized to correspond with multiples of public health recommendations. We evaluated the quantitative and categorical dose-response relationship between physical activity and PCA.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A curvilinear dose-response relationship between physical activity and PCA was observed; the benefits started at two-thirds (5 MET-hour/week) of the United States and World Health Organization guidelines–recommended minimum (7.5 MET-hour/week) and continued to 5 times (40 MET-hour/week) the recommended minimum ( _P_ nonlinearity <.001). The largest benefit was noted at a level of 2 to 3 times the recommended minimum (hazard ratio, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4 to 0.8). In addition, there was no evidence of an increased PCA risk at a level more than 5 times the recommended minimum (hazard ratio, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5 to 1.1). These associations were consistent regardless of age, sex, body mass index, comorbid conditions, and estimated 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The beneficial effect of physical activity on PCA started at two-thirds of the recommended minimum and continued to 5 times the recommended minimum.

Patients were categorized by revascularization status (nonrevascularized, percutaneous coronary intervention \\[PCI\\], or coronary artery bypass graft \\[CABG\\] surgery) and by metabolic equivalents (METs) achieved on stress testing. Using Cox regression models, hazard ratios for mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and downstream revascularizations were calculated after adjusting for potential confounders, including cardiac risk factors, pertinent medications, and stress testing indication.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】There were 3824 all-cause deaths during median follow-up of 11.5 years. In addition, 1880 MIs, and 1930 revascularizations were ascertained. Each 1-MET increment in exercise capacity was associated with a hazard ratio (95% CI) of 0.87 (0.85-0.89), 0.87 (0.85-0.90), and 0.86 (0.84-0.89) for mortality; 0.98 (0.96-1.01), 0.88 (0.84-0.92), and 0.93 (0.90-0.97) for MI; and 0.94 (0.92-0.96), 0.91 (0.88-0.95), and 0.96 (0.92-0.99) for downstream revascularizations in the nonrevascularized, PCI, and CABG groups, respectively. In each MET category, the nonrevascularized group had similar mortality risk as and higher MI and downstream revascularization risk than the PCI and CABG surgery groups ( _P_ <.05).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Exercise capacity was a strong predictor of mortality, MI, and downstream revascularizations in this cohort.

The authors describe 4 boys, aged 10 to 13 years, who were accidentally buried in sand, 2 of whom died as a result of the accident. The mechanism of injury in this report is somewhat different from that in previous publications that focused on sand aspiration and its management.\n\n【2】The current study indicates that the 2 boys died of asphyxia from thoracic compression due to the weight of the sand. The first boy was digging a tunnel in a backyard sandbox that collapsed on him. He was buried for about 10 minutes in dry sand and was unable to extricate himself. The boy had been playing unsupervised. The other 3 boys jumped into a large (30 feet) pile of wet sand at a construction site. As they ran down the sandpile, it collapsed and completely buried 1 boy and partially buried the other 2 boys. The completely buried youngster was under 12 feet of wet sand; he could not be rescued in time and died of thoracic compression asphyxia. One boy extricated himself and successfully sought help for his partially buried friend. These 3 boys were also unsu-pervised, and there was no information regarding the security or safety factors in place at the construction site. Neither of the 2 boys who died had evidence of sand aspiration.\n\n【3】Sand is composed of aluminum silicate, silicon dioxide, and calcium carbonate and is defined as sedimentary particles with a diameter of 0.05 to 2.0 mm. This distinguishes sand from larger particles such as gravel and smaller particles such as silt and clay. What is significant in the current report is the calculated weight of wet sand (in tons) that restricted the boys’ attempts at breathing, resulting in compressive thoracic asphyxia. Although highly unusual, these occurrences document a previously undescribed mechanism of injury in childhood sand burial. Of interest is the fact that all 4 were boys. It is well-known that boys are more frequently involved in accidents, presumably due to more adventurous and risky behavior.\n\n【4】During the summer months, newspapers, magazines, and television commercials often show youngsters building sand castles or instances of intentional sand burial up to the shoulder level, suggesting these activities are popular playtime pursuits . The current report unmasks the potential dangers associated with these activities.\n\n【5】Figure 1 Child playing in the sandbox in his backyard.

Middle and right, Photographs courtesy of Drs Mark A. and Mary Ellen Warner, Rochester, Minn.\n\n【7】Publication of the report by Zarroug et al should increase public awareness of a potential health hazard and alert authorities and safety officials at parks, beaches, and other public play areas. Safety precautions at potentially dangerous construction sites and industrial sand storage facilities should be instituted as part of an accident-prevention program with appropriate inspections to ensure compliance. Protective fences and security personnel are reasonable considerations in attempts to achieve this goal. Areas at risk include large sand dunes (often associated with sand holes), deep beach diggings, and large sand castles or tunnels. Such activities could be limited to specific sites in recreational areas that are well supervised by parents, lifeguards, or other beach or park personnel. The fact that 1 of the boys died in a deep sandbox in his backyard also suggests that a limitation in the depth of domestic sandboxes for children needs to be addressed.\n\n【8】An important message is that young children need to be supervised. If either of the 2 reported events had been observed, the chance of prompt extrication and survival would have been better. The authors are to be praised for making this information available to their medical colleagues. However, the message also needs to reach public health and accident-prevention officials in the community.

Paparodis vehemently objects to us raising the question of whether resident physicians should use stimulant drugs, such as modafinil, to promote attention and wakefulness. He thinks that by doing so we are breaking an “ethical law” and suggests that, if residents are allowed to use modafinil or other attention aids, it would be akin to treating residents as “experimental subjects under a fascist regime.” Paparodis further contrasts our comments with the efforts of physicians to keep their patients from using illegal stimulants.\n\n【1】We must point out that we did not advocate the use of modafinil by resident physicians. Additionally, we are not promoting, in any fashion, the use of illegal stimulants.

Dr Paparodis stated “Nobody can expect a physician to use a sleep suppressant and an attention stimulant to perform better under any conditions.” The article by Czeisler et al,\n\n【4】which prompted our editorial, suggests that this may in fact be possible. Physicians, including those in training, already legally and commonly use substances (eg, caffeine and nicotine) that alter the release of neuromodulators for the purpose of stimulating the central nervous system. The fact that these are not considered “drugs” because they are naturally occurring compounds (albeit highly processed) is only a matter of regulation. However, as discussed in our editorial, the data of Czeisler et al are from a nonresident physician population, and extrapolation of the data is difficult.

This time it is the story of Terry Wallis. Newspapers and the blogosphere are covering it extensively, using eye-catching titles: _“_ Miracle in Arkansas _”_\n\n【1】 _“_ Comatose man's brain rewired itself, doctors say. While fibers were severed, nerve cells stayed intact allowing later recovery”\n\n【2】 _“_ As man lay in coma-like state, his brain was busy rebuilding.”\n\n【3】In this editorial, I place these claims into perspective and review recent knowledge about recovery from prolonged comatose states.\n\n【4】It is useful to briefly revisit the categories of outcome in a patient comatose from a structural injury. To produce prolonged coma, insult and injury to the brain or brainstem must be devastating and widespread. Generally speaking, coma due to a structural cause (eg, anoxia-ischemia, traumatic head injury, hemorrhagic stroke, or meningoencephalitis) is associated with a poor outcome, particularly if patients show no improvement in consciousness within the first weeks. Outcome is worse with any episodes of further neurological deterioration (after early clinical presentation) and possibly better with early therapeutic intervention (eg, antimicrobial drugs, placement of ventriculostomy, or control of increased intracranial pressure) in response to identifiable causes of that deterioration. Patients may never regain consciousness and may die if further brain swelling and herniation or systemic complications occur. Advanced directives or prior voiced wishes of the patient to the family to not provide critical care may lead to withdrawal of support.\n\n【5】Patients who survive acute brain injury may never regain consciousness but open their eyes, fail to focus or track objects, and typically develop sleep-and-wake cycles, all clinical telltale signs of an emerging persistent vegetative state (PVS). Patients who awake often have a disability, and many display little effective communication and a major physical and cognitive handicap. New in this nosology is the category of _minimally conscious state_ (MCS), the most severe form of neurological disability in a conscious patient. These major categories of outcome are summarized in Figure 1 .\n\n【6】FIGURE 1 Major categories of outcome after structural cause of coma. (The size of the boxes estimates the frequency of occurrence of each category.) The dotted arrows represent possible transitions. MCS = minimally conscious state; PVS = persistent vegetative state.\n\n【7】Other factors that determine outcome from coma are age and multiorgan involvement. For example, traumatic injury to the brain in young individuals may, after a protracted period, lead to a satisfactory outcome, whereas anoxic-ischemic injury after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in elderly persons is typically associated with few survivors. However, within this spectrum of outcomes, clinical experience shows us that, if there is a structural cause of coma, withdrawal of medical support is common, and full recovery or minimal deficit with return to gainful employment is unlikely. Transition from a poor outcome to a good outcome may occur, but frequently outcome is determined at the onset of brain injury.\n\n【8】It involves eyes-open unconsciousness with no evidence of any behavioral (ie, purposeful) response of the patient to stimuli. Families should have no expectations of significant improvement when the condition persists 6 to 12 months after the ictus.\n\n【9】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【10】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【11】A recent clinical diagnosis, MCS indicates definitive evidence of awareness, albeit limited.\n\n【12】The diagnostic criteria are far more difficult to define, and the boundaries are uncertain (how minimal and how maximal?). The clinical designation of MCS may include more specific clinical diagnoses such as akinetic mutism, in which the patient can improve after certain medical or surgical interventions. Clinically, MCS can easily be distinguished from PVS, but little data indicate that MCS has a specific clinical course, specific findings on neuroimaging, or specific autopsy findings. Minimally conscious state can follow PVS, but there are only a few verified cases in the literature. After such rare recovery from PVS, these severely disabled and fully dependent patients, victims of a tragic catastrophic injury, may be aware of their surroundings but barely remember parts of the day. If we accept legitimacy of MCS as a distinct clinical entity, and not everyone does, it is a far more common condition than PVS. It is remarkable that the acceptance of MCS has been rapid. Its quick assimilation into the medical lexicon may have been influenced by attorneys attempting to challenge the clinical diagnosis in the recent Robert Wendland and Terri Schiavo legal cases.\n\n【13】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【14】I now return to the case of Terry Wallis. Wallis is an unfortunate, severely brain-injured man, whose disability began after his truck careened off a 25-foot bluff. He remained comatose initially but then improved gradually. More exceptionally, Wallis started to speak after 19 yearsof silence and grunts. This story, which at first look is amazing, had been in the news before. A television documentary that aired on the Discovery Health Channel in 2005 had covered the Wallis case in detail.\n\n【15】When physicians discussed prognosis with his mother, she was told that “Terry would probably never emerge.”\n\n【16】Physicians ignored his mother's call that “Terry is in there, he just can't communicate.” According to his mother, “they did not believe it, they just \\[said he is\\] in a coma and that is what he is going to be.” The documentary suggested that Wallis was in PVS and, if correct, that such a dramatic improvement implies that the concept of PVS is, at its core, deeply misleading. However I suspect that any neurologist who views the home video segments included in the Discovery Health Channel documentary will note that Wallis was not in PVS before his improvement. He looks about and responds quickly to his family. Although Wallis was not in PVS, it is unclear what state he really was in because he was not repeatedly examined by a neurologist.\n\n【17】Now a recent study from Weil Medical College of Cornell University has suggested that Wallis' brain shows possible axonal regrowth.\n\n【18】Possible axonal regrowth in late recovery from the minimally conscious state.\n\n【19】The investigators evaluated the patient's brain using magnetic resonance (MR) diffusion tensor imaging that specifically showed nerve fiber networks plus positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging that showed increased activity in the association cortex. However, the clinical correlate of these MR and PET findings was not one of awakening from coma or transition from a PVS to conscious awareness. Rather, the neurological examination showed improvement of motor strength in limbs notwithstanding severe contractures (extension of the legs when held in a flexed position and elevation of the lower back when the legs were pushed down) and documented attention using tests such as auditory vigilance (eg, raising a hand when hearing sounds). Less incoherent talk-ativeness was also noted, but there was no change in word fluency. The investigators concluded that these MR and PET findings could explain Wallis' improvement. The study indirectly implies that sophisticated neuroimaging may be better than clinical acumen. Additionally, it implies that there may be more than meets the neurologist's eye. However, it is unclear whether the physicians were aware of the MR findings during clinical reexamination. Other factors (eg, training of the patient through repeated examination) may have played a role in Wallis' performance tests results. Furthermore, the investigators acknowledge that their interpretation was always an analysis post facto when baseline studies (ie, before major changes in communication occurred) were not available. That is, of course, exactly what was missing.\n\n【20】Wallis has been called “a miracle” by the family and attending physicians. How can we as physicians understandthese “miracle cases”? There is most likely a major distinction between _recovery_ (meaning that the diagnosis is correct and there truly is exceptional improvement) and _discovery_ (in which the diagnosis is incorrect and changes with more methodical examination). Some of these “miracle” patients may not have been in a coma but in a variant of a locked-in syndrome. Some of the news coverage of these cases highlights that communication was possible through eye blinking even before speech returned.\n\n【21】Other patients suspected of being in MCS may have started to speak, often to the surprise of family members, when their tracheostomy was occluded and the cuff of the tracheotomy tube temporarily loosened. As such, attempts at discernable speech, which may have been impossible before, would now be mechanically possible. Washout of accumulated sedative drugs may play a role in speech resumption in such patients.\n\n【22】What is most interesting is that in many cases a fairly dramatic improvement in communication skills occurs over a period of hours or days, but then—if we believe the media coverage—the patients often typically relapse into the previous state. Not uncommonly, dopamine agonists or antidepressants have been introduced before clinical improvement, suggesting the possibility of neurotransmitter modulation in some patients in MCS. A systematic review of these cases would be useful, but the amassed information is likely to be fragmentary and difficult to interpret.\n\n【23】Certainly, research of coma is sparse, and new developments immediately attract attention. However, coverage of these so-called miracle recoveries is often hyperbole and serves little purpose. Physicians can raise concerns about the accuracy and validity of these individual reports, but these cases will inevitably be compared with the highly publicized Terri Schiavo case. The questions that will be raised by those suspicious of physicians' caution are the questions one may expect:\n\n【24】Question: Wallis was misdiagnosed as being in PVS (allegedly by nonneurologists who conversed with his mother). If this is the case, why was Schiavo not misdiagnosed as being in PVS as well?\n\n【25】Question: In the Schiavo case, many physicians were willing to submit affidavits claiming that she was not in PVS. Were they all wrong?\n\n【26】Question: If Wallis underwent rehabilitation and improved, should one not expect similar improvement had Schiavo been afforded similar rehabilitative therapy?\n\n【27】The answers to these questions lie in the fact that, unlike Wallis, Schiavo was unprecedentedly examined by no fewer than 7 board-certified neurologists, all of whom diagnosed her condition as PVS. As such, she could never have recovered to an independently functioning human being, able to care for herself. Strong opinions to the contrary emanated from others who did not actually examine Schiavo but instead watched videotapes of her examinations or edited videotapes provided by the parents. In the final analysis, it is fair to conclude that the neurological condition of Wallis and Schiavo bears no resemblance to each other .\n\n【28】FIGURE 2 Terry Wallis (with permission from _The New York Times_ ) and Terri Schiavo (with permission from Getty Images) as portrayed in the media. Although the untrained eye may spot differences—Wallis seems to look into the camera—the facial expression is the least valuable feature that distinguishes minimally conscious state from persistent vegetative state. The 2 neurological states can certainly not be distinguished with quickly captured photographs.\n\n【29】To say that the case of Wallis is evidence of meaningful clinical improvement in a case of PVS is a simplistic generalization. To say instead that PVS is often overdiagnosed because the clinical state is uncommon and few physicians have the skill to examine patients appropriately seems a more reasonable conclusion. Such a criticism is well known in the neurology community and applies to many other neurological conditions. Fortunately there are second opinions.\n\n【30】Saying that the results of the recent MR and PET studies of Wallis may result in effective rehabilitation for patients in MCS or PVS is misleading, creates unsupported expectations, and eventually leads to frustration for all concerned. The facts show that PVS is the result of a brain that is badly, and chronically, injured, and meaningful clinical recovery from PVS is possible only in the hopes and dreams of patients' loved ones and supporters. The prognosis may not be much different with MCS. These latter illfated patients are bedbound, need full nursing care, are double incontinent, drift away during attempted conversation, and are unable to participate in rigorous rehabilitation programs as a result of their inability to perform complex tasks and retain information in their stored memory.\n\n【31】On the other hand, the recent MR and PET images of Wallis' brain should not be quickly dismissed. To say that the discoveries are simply “much ado about nothing” (ie, just more neuronal tracts formed over many years in an already awake and aware—and not comatose—patient) may be ignoring a valuable, interesting phenomenon. However, we should then accept that axonal sprouting from uninjured brain tissue is the correct interpretation of the MR images. This phenomenon has been demonstrated before and may be under the control of basic fibroblast growth factor or other neurotrophic factors. Nonetheless, leading experts in this area are unconvinced that such an intrinsic brain repair mechanism would lead to major clinical improvements, let alone awakening from coma.\n\n【32】The more appropriate interpretation is that studies are needed in a much larger, clearly defined patient population, and the patients must be examined by skilled neurologists and the findings correlated with serial functional MR studies.\n\n【33】Can PET and functional MR imaging be helpful to clinical neurologists who care for patients like Wallis? I think they can. Admirable groundbreaking research from both the Cyclotron Research Center of the University of Liege\n\n【34】and the Functional MRI Research Center of Columbia University\n\n【35】fMRI reveals large-scale network activation in minimally conscious patients.\n\n【36】has shown, for the first time, a glimpse into brain activity in PVS and MCS. Although it is not a major chore for a neurologist to distinguish the 2 conditions, these studies could help in identifying imaging correlates. Perhaps these studies could offer insights into the possible recovery from early stages of a vegetative state that is not persistent or permanent. A large amount of data is emerging but from few patients, and it is still a major leap to interpret these studies as a way to understand “miracle recoveries.”\n\n【37】It would not be surprising to learn that the media attention associated with the Wallis/MR/PET story was an unintended, regrettable consequence of the Cornell investigators' research. Scientific findings with doubtful generalizable conclusions, particularly when preliminary and based on a single case, should remain in academic circles for further debate and synthesis before being shared with the public. Most of the media cannot discern the subtleties of problems with interpretation, and most of the public may interpret wrongly. In these instances, it is the duty of neurologists to clarify, explain, and caution.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:20:23", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:21:34", "cost": 71.039}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:36", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:21:34", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:20:22"}

We compared payments disclosed by US-based physicians who were first or last authors of clinical drug trials published between August 2016 and August 2018 in the _New England Journal of Medicine_ , _JAMA,_ and _Lancet_ , to payments reported by industry to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Open Payments Database. Of 247 included authors, 198 (80%) have not disclosed some or all received payments. The median undisclosed sum was $8409 (US Dollars) (interquartile range \\[IQR\\] $123 to $44,890). Most authors (n=170, 69%) have received more than $10,000 per year (median $120,403, IQR $58,905 to $242,014). The median undisclosed sum for these authors was $26,530 (IQR $7462 to $71,562). Median undisclosed sums for authors of papers from studies performed with and without industry funding were $20,899 (IQR $4191 to $59,883) and $149 (IQR $0 to $3276), respectively. In 10 (8%) of 125 industry-funded trials, the first or last author had not disclosed personal payments from the study sponsor (median $9741, IQR $4508 to $101,484). These findings could raise concerns about the authors' equipoise toward the trial results and influence the public perception of the credibility of reported data.

He discovered at least 8 carotenoids, prepared them in pure form, and determined their composition. He also described the structure of vitamin B and contributed to the isolation of vitamin B <sub>6 </sub> (pyridoxine).\n\n【1】Kuhn was born on December 3, 1900, in Vienna, Austria. His father was an engineer, and his mother was an elementary schoolteacher. He was taught at home until he was 9 years old and then studied at the Dobling Gymnasium in Vienna for 8 years. In 1917, he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army and served in World War I (1914-1918).\n\n【2】After the war, Kuhn enrolled at the University of Vienna, where he studied for 3 semesters before transferring to the University of Munich (Germany). He received a PhD degree from the University of Munich in 1922. His doctoral thesis was on the specificity of enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism. This work was supervised by the famous German chemist Richard Willstatter (1872-1942). Kuhn continued his studies at the University of Munich until 1926, when he accepted an offer to join the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, and became professor of chemistry at the Swiss Technical School. In 1929, he was appointed professor of chemistry at the University of Heidelberg (Germany), where he became director of the new Chemistry Institute of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Scientific Research. He became director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in 1937 and was instrumental in having its name changed to the Max Planck Institute for the Advancement of Science.\n\n<mark>【3】删除21:In his work on carotenoids, Kuhn discovered carotene (the pigment in carrots) and, independently of Swiss chemist and Nobel laureate Paul Karrer (1889-1971), found 2 distinct compounds in carotene: β-carotene and α-carotene. Later, Kuhn found a third carotene, which he called γ- carotene , and learned that carotene is a precursor of vitamin A. After studying carotenoids, he turned his attention to the water-soluble vitamin B groups and isolated vitamin B 6  in 1938.</mark> </sub> in 1938.</u>\n\n【4】Although Kuhn was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize as a German citizen he was forbidden by the Nazi government to go to Stockholm, Sweden, to accept it. He had to wait until 1949, after the war was over and the Nazi government was no longer in power, to accept the honor. After 1950, Kuhn made many important contributions to medicine. He identified para-aminobenzoic acid (a compound that proved useful in the synthesis of anesthetics) and pantothenic acid (an important agent in hemoglobin formation and release of energy from carbohydrates). He was most interested in the practical application of his work to agriculture and medicine and focused his efforts on the study of organic substances that are instrumental in the body's resistance to infection. His investigations of influenza, cholera, and the potato beetle larva led to valuable insights into the molecular interaction between an organism and its assailant.\n\n【5】删除21:<u>Kuhn received many awards and honors besides the Nobel Prize.

He had urinary retention. Neurological examination showed spastic paraparesis (Medical Research Council grades 1 to 3, worst at ankles and thighs). Reflexes were diffusely reduced with bilateral Babinski signs. There was symmetric loss of vibration and pain detection extending to the umbilicus and hands. He required 2-person assistance to stand and walk. A large cervicothoracic syrinx was seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in association with cervical stenosis. Despite cervical decompression fusion at C5-C6, he continued to worsen. Repeated MRI with contrast identified enlargement and enhancement of all roots. Electromyography and nerve conductions identified an axonal predominant chronic-active polyradiculopathy C5-T1 and L2-S1 with fibrillations extending to paraspinal muscles. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein was elevated at 102 mg/dL, and an inflammatory myelopolyradiculopathy with syrinx was postulated, with no other explanation found. He did not respond to weekly intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone, which were discontinued after 6 months.\n\n【2】In referral, we noted that the syrinx was associated with thoracolumbar flow voids, raising the possibility of a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) . Spinal angiogram confirmed the SDAVF, arising from the left L1 lumbar artery, which was treated by transarterial embolization . Three months after the procedure, he had normal power and near-normal gait, with resumption of outdoor hiking. Babinski signs and urinary retention persisted, but reflexes returned, and sensation improved. Repeated MRI of the spine showed the cervicothoracic syrinx resolved, and all roots had normalized: no longer enlarged or enhancing .\n\n【3】Figure **(A),** Sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan shows the longitudinally expansive spinal syringomyelia in the described patient ( **white arrows** ). **(B),** Sagittal T2- weighted MRI revealing subtle intrathecal flow voids within the thoracolumbar spinal canal ( **white arrows** ). **(C),** Spinal angiogram radiograph demonstrates an abnormal draining vein ( **white arrows),** a spinal dural AV fistula ( **asterisk** ) arising from the left L1 lumbar artery ( **white arrow heads** ). **(D),** Postembolization shows resolution of the fistula by embolization material ( **white arrow** ), with persistence of the lumbar artery ( **arrow heads** ). **(E and G),** Pre-embolization. **(E),** Axial T2-weighted MRI shows the syrinx ( **white arrow** ) at the C7 level; **(G)** postcontrast sagittal T1-weighted MRI shows enlargement and enhancement of the lumbosacral spinal roots ( **white arrows** ), also seen at thoracic and cervical levels (not shown). **(F and H),** Three months postembolization; **(F)** axial T2- weighted MRI demonstrates a decrease of the syrinx ( **white arrow** ) maximal diameter from 6 mm to 2 mm at C7 level; **(H)** postcontrast sagittal T1-weighted MRI shows resolution of the lumbosacral root enlargements and enhancement.\n\n【4】Syringomyelia is the result of an expansion of CSF in the spinal cord.

Our patient still has urinary retention, and like CM-1 patients status post-foramen magnum decompression, some extent of myelomalacia is predicted in chronic disease.

Lower-extremity weakness, episodes of acute worsening, sensory level, or sphincter dysfunction should raise the possibility of SDAVF. A decision to move to spinal angiogram can be assisted by observation of venous congestion on routine MRI as witnessed by flow voids on T2 imaging most commonly seen on sagittal images .

Validated instruments were used to assess burnout, depression, and quality of life (QOL). Students were also asked about the prevalence of significant personal life events in the previous 12 months and strategies used to cope with stress.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Although symptoms of depression and overall burnout were similar among minority and nonminority students, minority students were more likely to have a low sense of personal accomplishment ( _P_ \\=.02) and lower QOL in a number of domains (all _P_ ≤.05). These differences persisted on multivariate analysis that controlled for demographic characteristics and recent life events. Minority students were also more likely to have a child ( _P_ \\=.01), originate from outside Minnesota ( _P_ <.001), and experience a major personal illness in the last 12 months ( _P_ \\=.03).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】As a group, the minority medical students in this survey had a lower sense of personal accomplishment and QOL than nonminority students.

This retrospective cohort study included patients from a medical ICU from April 1, 1995, to November 30, 2009. Data collected from the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III database included demographic characteristics; severity of illness scores; noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation time; ICU and hospital length of stay; and ICU, hospital, and 1-year mortality. Statistically significant univariate variables for 1-year mortality were entered into a multivariate model, and the independent variables were used to generate a scoring system to predict 1-year mortality rate. At 1-year follow-up, 295 of 591 patients died (50%). Age and hospital length of stay were identified as independent determinants of mortality at 1 year by using multivariate analysis, and the predictive model developed had an area under the operating curve of 0.68. Bootstrap analysis with 1000 iterations validated the model, age, and hospital length of stay, entered the model 100% of the time (area under the operating curve=0.687; 95% CI, 0.686-0.688).

The patient had a depressed nose, corneal opacity in the left eye, an eroded tip of the tongue, multiple missing teeth , and acroamputations in both hands and feet with plantar ulcers . She had sluggishly reactive pupils, diminished facial and oral sensation, and loss of pain and temperature sensation. Autonomic dysfunction was documented by abnormal results of isometric handgrip, cold pressor, starch-iodine sweat, Schirmer, and skin wrinkle testing and abnormal 30:15 ratio and E/I ratio on electrocardiography.

Addressing health concerns, even relatively simple ones, has not become as easy.\n\n【1】Despite digital advances in other industries, health care lags behind. Although a study published in this journal nearly a decade ago described an online alternative to the traditional in-person provision of primary care,\n\n【2】primary care E-Visits within health systems remain a small proportion of all primary care delivered, and their costs and benefits are not fully understood.\n\n【3】Although advances in electronic provision of health care have been relatively slow, given the ongoing evolution to a more digital world, increasing use of E-Visits for primary care may not only be inevitable but may also better accommodate growing patient preferences for convenience as the patient population changes. It is becoming increasingly clear that younger patients are less likely than older adults to seek health care in the historically typical approach of placing a phone call to schedule an in-person visit to his or her primary care provider, who may or may not be available that day. Recent research by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that approximately one-quarter of polled adults did not have a primary care provider\n\n【4】 however, the proportion was much higher in the youngest adults polled, with nearly half of those aged 18 to 29 years reporting having no primary care provider.\n\n【5】Furthermore, younger generations may seek alternatives to traditional primary care for the sake of convenience\n\n【6】and expectations of efficiency and service.\n\n【7】删除19:<u><sup><a>5</a></sup></u>\n\n【8】Millennial expectations are fundamentally changing the healthcare landscape.\n\n【9】In addition to consideration of changing patient preferences, the value of health care is more important now than ever, and we must pursue comparisons of values across various strategies of care delivery. Although the E-Visit costs for patients and providers depend on reimbursement and insurance policies and unfortunately remain “unsettled,”\n\n【10】the outcome in the value equation, the benefit of the patients' care, must also be evaluated. Previous studies have reviewed the feasibility and uptake of primary care E-Visits, but the validity of diagnoses provided through this care delivery had yet to be determined.\n\n【11】Diagnostic accuracy in primary care E-Visits: evaluation of a large integrated health care delivery system's experience.\n\n【12】from Baylor Scott & White Health (BSWH) reviewed the diagnostic accuracy of E-Visits for primary care for patients meeting eligibility criteria, which included specific age and diagnosis ranges. These indications were all low-acuity illnesses, fully described in their Table 1, and included conditions such as upper respiratory infection, which comprised most of the E-Visits, as well as conjunctivitis, yeast infection, urinary tract infection, and tobacco use cessation seeking. Eligible patients must also have been covered by employee health insurance and have an established physician-patient relationship. Patients accessed the primary care E-Visits through the BSWH health portal, where they entered their demographic and medical information for review and diagnosis by an advanced practice provider. During the 10 days after the initial visit, patients accessing primary care electronically were slightly more likely than those accessing via face-to-face visits to have a related follow-up visit (11%-12% vs 9%). However, diagnostic accuracy was consistently similar for the E-Visit and face-to-face groups, with few patients having diagnoses revised (2%-6% across 4 modeling approaches). These results show that for selected low-acuity illnesses, diagnostic accuracy was high and did not vary across locations of care.\n\n【13】An advantage of this BSWH E-Visit model is that it was provided within an existing health system, facilitating continuity of care and complete medical records, as opposed to a patient visit to an external institution for electronic or urgent care that could result in fragmented care for individual patients. However, given its limited scope to those with employee health insurance, established physician relationships, and a previous face-to-face visit within 12 months, its generalizability to the one-quarter of adults and one-half of young adults without an established primary care relationship is unclear.\n\n【14】Their findings regarding diagnostic accuracy for low-acuity illnesses varied from those of existing studies of other patient populations. Research by my Mayo Clinic colleagues studied diagnostic accuracy in patients referred from primary care to our institution's advanced specialty care for further evaluation for relatively undifferentiated index diagnoses.\n\n【15】Despite the BSWH cohort maintaining diagnoses for 94% to 98% of patients, the Mayo Clinic study found that only 12% of referral diagnoses remained unchanged; two-thirds of patients had their diagnoses better defined or refined, and one-fifth of patients received a diagnosis distinctly different than the referral diagnosis. These discrepancies underlie the fact that these present results should not be considered applicable to other settings, such as higher-acuity illnesses or specialty care, without further study.\n\n【16】Although an E-Visit may be a first method of contact with the health care system for a patient with a health concern, it may not be his or her last. The present study determined that E-Visits led to subsequent in-person follow-up visits for any indication for 40% of patients and for related indications for 11% to 12% of patients. This is substantially higher than the 6% previously reported,\n\n【17】but again the methods of these studies vary. For that reason, evaluation of both the health care utilization and costs associated with E-Visits should include any related, and perhaps unrelated, subsequent care within a reasonable period.\n\n【18】Although E-Visits may be preferred by an increasing proportion of patients, there may be drawbacks as well. A study of E-Visit adoption at a large health care institution in the United States found that physicians who adopted E-Visits accepted 15% fewer new patients each month relative to other physicians.\n\n【19】This finding, in concert with the known shortage of primary care providers, is concerning. However, other studies have acknowledged that diversion of approximately 20% of in-person primary care visits to electronic communication may be possible\n\n【20】and, furthermore, may reduce or eliminate the projected primary care physician shortage.\n\n【21】Therefore, the effect of E-Visit adoption on primary care provider productivity and efficiency, as well as provider satisfaction and perhaps alternative staffing models, should continue to be considered.\n\n【22】Health care providers and their institutions must continue adapting to our digital world, the changing health care landscape, and evolving patient preferences. The present study affirms that diagnoses through electronic provision of primary care for selected indications in a specific population are as accurate as those provided through a more traditional in-person visit for similar needs, assuring health care institutions and providers considering provision of E-Visits that such care will be safe and effective. Future work should focus on increasing access to valued care to all patients while maintaining provider and patient experience and care continuity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 09:59:38", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:00:26", "cost": 48.392}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:36", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:00:26", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 17:59:37"}

Although contact tracing is a known evidence-based strategy in the community setting, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the challenges to implementing labor-intensive contact tracing in the occupational setting of large health care systems and hospitals, the epicenter of the pandemic. We present a framework for feasible, scalable COVID-19 contact tracing in a large multistate health system in the United States employing approximately 69,000 health care personnel. The framework is shared with sufficient details to allow adoption or adaptation by other health systems.

One study showed that more than half of HCPs were not familiar with the contact tracing process early in the Ebola response.\n\n【15】Another study of urgent care providers in Utah and southern Idaho also has shown the majority not knowing the prevention and control measures performed by public health practitioners after reporting occurs, including contact tracing.\n\n【16】Urgent care providers' knowledge and attitude about public health reporting and pertussis control measures: implications for informatics.\n\n【17】In addition, although contact tracing in the community is a clear and evidence-based strategy in times of epidemics, it can be challenging to apply this strategy efficiently in the occupational setting of large and complex health care organizations. In the United States, there are large health systems with hospitals that employ tens of thousands of HCPs. It is extremely resource-intensive to implement contact tracing in these settings, yet it is a critical issue because these hospitals have become the epicenter of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has acknowledged that some facilities may lack the resources necessary to maintain contact tracing of HCPs.\n\n【18】Therefore, we present a framework for COVID-19 contact tracing that was implemented in a large multistate health system in the United States. The framework is shared with sufficient detail to allow timely adaptation and adoption by other health systems.\n\n【19】Methods\n-------\n\n【20】We developed the new contact tracing approach following quality improvement principles. The approach consisted of describing the current state, identifying relevant stakeholders, and applying continuous cycles of improvement in which the intervention was modified based on stakeholder feedback.\n\n【21】### Setting\n\n【22】Mayo Clinic is comprised of three major campuses located in Rochester, Minnesota; Jacksonville, Florida; and Phoenix, Arizona; as well as multiple Mayo Clinic Health System hospitals and clinics throughout the Midwest in Minnesota and Wisconsin employing approximately 69,000 HCPs. Greater than 1,200,000 patients are seen per year from all 50 states and 138 countries. The employee Occupational Health Service (OHS) is structured so that each of the three main campuses and each of the four Mayo Clinic Health System regions provide occupational services and programming tailored to their local needs with collaborative administrative support and a single unified occupational health database.\n\n【23】### The Existing Process Before the Pandemic\n\n【24】Accurate and thorough occupational contact tracing is labor intensive. With prior contact tracing and exposure investigations, processes were largely focused on patient-to-HCP exposures. In this scenario, most exposed HCP could be identified by reviewing the electronic medical record (EMR) and using its integrated tracing tool. With community spread of COVID-19, approximately 50% of occupational exposures involved a coworker as the source. With relatively mild symptoms and absence of fever being common, COVID-19–positive individuals may be unaware that they are possibly infected.\n\n【25】Our existing contact tracing process relied upon detailed interviews performed by OHS to identify HCPs who may have had contact with an infected individual during the communicable period. Applying this process to COVID-19, OHS staff spent up to 45 min interviewing a COVID-19–infected individual to obtain details of their activities at work and a list of HCPs with whom they had close contact. It became readily apparent that employees have numerous interactions with coworkers throughout the day, many in close proximity (<6 ft) for extended periods.\n\n【26】Contact tracing was not only lengthy and labor-intensive for HCP-to-HCP exposures, but also for patient-to-HCP exposures. Because the EMR captures only personnel who documented their interaction with a patient, the EMR may miss many individuals exposed to a patient such as students, residents, techs, or others who did not document on the patient’s chart. For exposures that do not involve a patient as the source, contact tracing tools in the EMR cannot be used at all as interactions outside of patient care are not documented in the EMR. For both patient and HCPs who were communicable for COVID-19, interviews with the supervisor of a work area such as a nurse manager often uncovered additional HCP who were potentially exposed.\n\n【27】Once the list of potential contacts of a COVID-19–infected person was obtained, a small team of OHS staff would begin making calls to potentially exposed HCPs. Each call took approximately 15 to 20 minutes to establish contact, explain the cause for concern of exposure, obtain information on proximity of interaction, duration of contact, and whether personal protective equipment (PPE) such as a surgical mask and/or face shield was worn, determine the risk level of the exposure, and counsel the employee accordingly. Following the phone call, additional tasks are needed depending upon the findings of the interview. These may include recommending quarantine, enforcing it through work restrictions, and enrolling the exposed HCP in an ongoing monitoring program of self-monitoring or active monitoring depending upon the exposure risk level. With self-monitoring, HCPs monitor for fever or symptoms twice daily, reporting to OHS if symptoms occur; active monitoring involves twice-daily communication with OHS verifying the presence or absence of fever or symptoms. For a team of two OHS staff members, an exposure incident with 30 potentially exposed HCP would take more than 5 hours to obtain the contact list, call all potentially exposed HCP, and perform appropriate follow-up. This does not include additional time spent in communication with supervisors and department managers or responding to calls from unexposed but concerned coworkers. Thus, with COVID-19, it quickly became apparent that existing processes developed to perform contact tracing for exposures to HCPs would not be scalable.\n\n【28】### Resources and Principles\n\n【29】To identify a scalable and sustainable solution, Mayo Clinic mobilized a large team to bring programming, project management, and administrative expertise to collaborate with OHS to address contact tracing needs.\n\n【30】Clinical guidance and recommended precautions are based upon input from Mayo Clinic Infection Prevention and Control, State and Local Health Departments, institutional policy, and applicable employment law. Throughout this evolving pandemic, occupational health professionals have been fully engaged in the institution’s pandemic response planning to ensure that exposure mitigation strategies applied to personnel are aligned with current best practices and institutional priorities. We believe these efforts are critical to flattening the curve of COVID-19–positive cases as well as ensuring the safety and health of both patients and employees.\n\n【31】Because of an exponential increase in COVID-19 cases predicted by epidemiologic modeling, the team identified a need for advanced tools to enable timely and scalable occupational contact tracing. Tools developed for community contact tracing were reviewed, and although these tools may be useful in the community setting, they were not adopted because they do not capture the complexity of the health care environment. Contact tracing in the health care setting must be:\n\n【32】*   •\n\n【33】    Proactive — Employers cannot rely on HCPs to adopt technology and self-report exposures.\n\n【34】*   •\n\n【35】    Rapid — OHS must notify potentially exposed HCP quickly at any time of the day or night. COVID-19’s incubation period may be as short as 1 day, so HCP must be assessed before their next shift.\n\n【36】*   •\n\n【37】    Thorough — Facilities must be able to identify exposed HCPs in any area of the hospital/clinic/campus regardless of whether they documented their encounter in the EMR.\n\n【38】*   •\n\n【39】    Specific — Although electronic community tracing technology can identify physical proximity, this tracking is typically two-dimensional; multistory buildings such as health care centers require the ability to identify proximity in three dimensions.\n\n【40】*   •\n\n【41】    Uniform — The process should support contact tracing whether the source is a patient or an HCP.\n\n【42】*   •\n\n【43】    Simultaneous — For efficiency, the process must allow different team members (non-clinical staff, providers, and nurses) to work in parallel on different steps in the exposure assessment and contact tracing process.\n\n【44】*   •\n\n【45】    Integrated — Engagement with Infection Prevention and Control and use of all available resources, including any available EMR tracing tools for COVID-19–positive patients, is important.\n\n【46】### The New Approach (Mayo Clinic Contact Tracing Process 2.0)\n\n【47】Following the identification of an employee or patient who is found to be COVID-19–positive, Mayo Clinic now uses a uniform process to perform contact tracing at all sites, with some core components centralized in Rochester, Minnesota, for efficiency. The framework developed for this approach is presented in Figure 1 . This process starts with identification of the source patient or HCP, and interactions to ascertain the potential for contact with other HCPs. A Rochester-based OHS clinician serves as an Exposure Triage Provider (ETP) whose role is to evaluate each potential exposure and initiate the contact tracing process. Contact tracing is partially delegated to responsible parties at the site of the exposure by sending electronic contact logs to appropriate supervisors, unit managers, or onsite Occupational Health and Infection Prevention and Control (IPAC) Partners. Timely completion of electronic contact logs is monitored and facilitated by a Non-Clinical Call Center (NCCC) in Rochester. Risk assessment of exposed HCPs is performed by a Rochester-based Exposure Investigation Team (EIT) consisting of physicians and advance-practice providers. These centralized teams (the ETP, EIT, and NCCC) operate 24 hours/7 days a week to ensure efficient and timely contact tracing and exposure assessment.\n\n【48】Figure 1 Framework for scaling occupational health contact tracing during a pandemic.\n\n【49】After the individual’s exposure has been assessed, occupational health nursing teams issue and manage work restrictions, arrange testing for any symptomatic personnel, initiate active monitoring when indicated, and provide additional education. A toll-free Employee COVID-19 Help Line staffed by nurses has been created to help employees at all sites address COVID-19 occupational health concerns.\n\n【50】COVID-19–Positive Patient Process\n---------------------------------\n\n【51】Whether the source individual is a patient or an HCP, the local OHS team and the Rochester-based ETP collaborate to investigate potential exposures. When the source individual is a patient, OHS leaders partner with their local IPAC colleagues to assess exposure and identify potentially exposed HCP. The EMR is reviewed to create an initial list of employees who have documented in the patient’s record. The local OHS team works with IPAC to populate the electronic contact log, or may delegate completion of the log to a nurse manager at their site. Names of additionally exposed HCP identified by nurse managers and the patient care team are added to the log when applicable. Completed contact logs are submitted electronically and received centrally in Rochester, which initiates the process of notifying and assessing potentially exposed HCPs.\n\n【52】### COVID-19–Positive HCP Process\n\n【53】OHS is notified of a COVID-19–positive lab result by notification from IPAC, public health partners, or by self-reporting on the part of the infected worker. The ETP must then ascertain the communicable period of the HCP and the potential for coworker exposures. Two options exist for this function: the ETP may personally interview the individual, or may opt to trigger an email containing instructions for the individual to complete a secure online self-assessment form with pertinent details including symptom onset and dates worked. If the second option is chosen, the NCCC calls the employee to alert them to the form and assists in filling out the form if the employee is too unwell or has difficultly accessing their email from home. If the employee is well enough and willing to assist in identifying potentially exposed coworkers, the ETP may send them a contact log as well.\n\n【54】Work restrictions are then issued for the source HCP by the Nursing Exposure Follow-up team consistent with guidelines developed by OHS providers in collaboration with state public health departments.\n\n【55】### Identification and Notification of Exposed HCP\n\n【56】When it appears that an exposure may have occurred, the ETP creates a new exposure event in the occupational health database including dates that the index case was infectious. A notice is sent to designees such as nurse managers as described above who populate a contact log with a list of HCPs who may have had close contact with the source individual during their communicable period. Population of the list is facilitated by integration with the institution’s human resources database so that HCPs can be found using a search feature.\n\n【57】Submitted logs are reviewed for quality purposes by the ETP, who then triggers notification of all potentially exposed HCP on the contact log. These individuals are sent a link to a secure online Exposed Employee Assessment form in which they can verify and clarify the contact they had with the source individual, note any PPE they wore during the encounter, and report any symptoms they may be experiencing. The benefit to this system is that all potentially exposed employees are notified quickly and simultaneously. The NCCC calls each exposed employee to request completion of the digital form as quickly as possible so that an exposure risk assessment can be performed and work restrictions determined. NCCC staff members are able to populate the assessment form on behalf of the exposed employee if the exposed employee has technical difficulties or requests help. The responses are immediately reviewed by an EIT provider who then calls the exposed employee and determines if their risk of exposure is high, medium, low, or none . The EIT provider counsels the employee on quarantine, work restrictions, and/or testing as needed, and notifies the Nursing Exposure Team. The Nursing Exposure Team issues work restrictions, sends education, initiates active monitoring, and coordinates testing as indicated based on the EIT provider’s assessment.\n\n【58】Figure 2 Exposure risk to health care personnel (HCP) modified based on personal protective equipment (PPE).\n\n【59】Show full caption\n\n【60】<sup>a </sup> The risk category for these rows would be elevated by one level if HCP performed or were present for a procedure likely to generate higher concentrations of respiratory secretions or aerosols. For example, HCP who were wearing a gown, gloves, eye protection and a facemask (instead of a respirator) during an aerosol-generating procedure would be considered to have a medium-risk exposure.\n\n【61】<sup>b </sup> HCP not using all recommended PPE who have only brief interactions (< 6ft, <5min) with a patient regardless of whether patient was wearing a facemask are considered low-risk.\n\n【62】<sup>c </sup> HCP who walk by a patient or who have no direct contact with the patient or their secretions/excretions and no entry into the patient room are considered to have no identifiable risk.\n\n【63】<sup>d </sup> HCP NOT wearing a facemask or respirator in the role of desk triage, intake staff, reception, scheduling are considered to have LOW risk exposure due to very brief exposure while the patient was wearing a mask.\n\n【64】<sup>e </sup> Eye protection must be a face shield, safety goggles, or safety glasses.\n\n【65】Figure 3 Exposed employee assessment algorithm. HCP = health care personnel; OHS = Occupational Health Services.\n\n【66】### Completion\n\n【67】During the contact tracing process and exposure investigation, the centralized OHS exposure team remains in contact with the local OHS site. Upon completion of the exposure investigation, OHS sends a summary of the exposure event to the site OHS team for review, which they disseminate to any requesting public health authority. Local OHS providers have access to the occupational health database to monitor progress of an exposure. An overview of the process is summarized in Figure 4 .\n\n【68】Figure 4 Exposure investigation process overview.\n\n【69】### Groups Involved in Contact Tracing and Exposure Investigation\n\n【70】Four groups are involved in the contact tracing process:\n\n【71】#### OHS Exposure Triage Provider Team\n\n【72】Comprised of physicians and nurse practitioners with expertise in occupational medicine, the ETPs evaluate all newly identified COVID-19–positive patients and HCPs to determine the communicability period (infectious window) and whether the individual exposed others during that timeframe. Once an exposure is identified, the ETP will identify the appropriate individuals to complete a contact log, as outlined above, and triggers dissemination of the contact logs. ETPs also serve as a resource to the EIT and Nursing Exposure Teams.\n\n【73】#### Non-Clinical Call Center\n\n【74】The NCCC is comprised of non-OHS staff who assist with data collection needs associated with contact tracing. These individuals are redeployed staff from administrative and laboratory areas. The NCCC provides 24 hours/7 days a week support to any involved HCPs who need assistance with completing an electronic form. When an email is sent to the individual, the NCCC representative calls them to ensure they are able to complete the form in a timely manner. If clinical questions arise during the call, the individual is transferred to the appropriate Nursing Exposure Team based on the location of the employee.\n\n【75】#### Exposure Investigation Team\n\n【76】The EIT is comprised of physicians and advance practice providers redeployed from the Department of Medicine. Once the exposed employees complete an Exposed Employee Assessment form, the EIT applies Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state guidelines to conduct risk assessment and characterize the exposure as high, medium, or low risk. This exposure categorization is then shared with the Nursing Exposure Team as outlined above.\n\n【77】#### Nursing Exposure Teams\n\n【78】The Nursing Exposure Teams are site-based and address an employee’s clinical needs if the employee tested positive for COVID-19, were part of a known exposure and have questions, or would like to inquire about their work status. The Nursing Exposure Team will also issue work restrictions and facilitate testing, as appropriate. Guidelines approved by providers are used for consistency. Provider support for questions outside of the established guidelines is readily available to the Nursing Exposure Teams.\n\n【79】Digital Tools Developed\n-----------------------\n\n【80】### Information Technology Systems\n\n【81】The software application used internally by OHS is Occupational Case Management (OCM), a proprietary system. Employees receive notices and submit electronic forms through a portal that is integrated with OCM called the Employee Occupational Health online portal.\n\n【82】The COVID-19 management system is housed within OCM and facilitates launching email notices of potential exposure with links to fill out forms to an unlimited number of employees simultaneously. It also tracks all pending forms so that the NCCC can follow-up on any forms that have not been completed. With separate queues of work for providers, nurses, and call-center staff, all teams can work in parallel on cases that are in different stages of the workflow.\n\n【83】There is no direct connection to or from the EMR between the OCM database and its digital contact tracing and exposure assessment tools. The system relies on a combination of .NET, Java components, and Sybase.\n\n【84】### COVID-19–Positive Self-Assessment Form\n\n【85】If the COVID-19–positive individual is an HCP, they are asked to complete a form that provides essential information to help determine the communicable period and whether potential exposure to others at work may have occurred . The form asks the source individual to check the symptoms that they are currently experiencing (fever, shortness of breath, chills, etc), asks if they worked while symptomatic, the dates they were on campus, and whether they were previously exposed to a known COVID-19–positive individual.\n\n【86】Figure 5 Health care personnel with COVID-19 assessment form.\n\n【87】### COVID-19 Exposure Contact Log\n\n【88】The COVID-19 Exposure Contact Log allows supervisors and HCP to identify potential contacts . The contact log is integrated with the human resource system (Lawson) to allow identification of the correct individuals and facilitate electronic access to the exposed individual’s contact information including email address and department. In addition to the source employee, trusted stakeholders/delegates (people who have the best front-line information including the ability to identify HCPs who had close contact with the source patient but may not have documented in the EMR) in leadership positions can contribute to the contact tracing process including unit managers, supervisors, attending physicians, and index case (COVID-19– infected individual) if HCP.\n\n【89】Figure 6 Staff Exposure Contact Log.\n\n【90】### Exposed Employee Assessment Form\n\n【91】Potentially exposed employees receive an email requesting they complete the Exposed Employee Assessment Form . The form allows the individual to provide essential information used to determine their risk of exposure (proximity, duration, and PPE worn). The form asks the potentially exposed employee to check any symptoms that they are currently experiencing (fever, shortness of breath, chills, etc), whether they work in a patient care setting, and if they have been tested or diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n【92】Figure 7 Exposed Employee Assessment Form.\n\n【93】Figure 7 Exposed Employee Assessment Form.\n\n【94】Discussion\n----------\n\n【95】Contact tracing has been extremely successful in identification and control of other pathogens such as tuberculosis\n\n【96】and is one of the strategic tools to prevent spread of COVID-19.\n\n【97】It has become a key component of COVID-19 containment.\n\n【98】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【99】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【100】However, knowledge of contact tracing procedures is limited and guidance on how to implement contact tracing in the occupational setting of large complex health systems and hospitals is needed.\n\n【101】With these newly developed electronic tools, additional expertise, and organization into functional teams, we have been able to reduce the time from notification of a COVID-19–positive test result to identification and assessment of any exposed HCP and completion of the exposure investigation to under 2 hours on average. Key benefits of this process include: 1) the ability to quickly develop a list of potentially exposed employees supported by developing a digital contact log integrated with the human resources demographics database; 2) the ability for multiple teams to work simultaneously on exposure investigations; and 3) centralization and standardization of key pieces of the process (initial investigation, exposure investigation and assessment) with the assistance of electronic tools.\n\n【102】HCP, supervisors, and the OHS team have all expressed that the new process provides added efficiency and integration of standardized processes across the Mayo Clinic enterprise sites and has improved support to exposed employees. This process and its electronic tools make scalable contact tracing feasible. The ability to sustain contact tracing and exposure investigation will enhance the institution’s ability to keep our health care environments safe for both patients and personnel alike.\n\n【103】### Study Limitations\n\n【104】As with any practice change or quality improvement process, concerns about applicability and replication of the intervention in other health systems exist. We attempted to describe the intervention with sufficient details to facilitate implementation elsewhere. The ability to integrate with the facility’s human resources system which contains HCP contact information is key. Like many practice change interventions, this implementation did not follow a true experimental or comparative design. The current intervention was developed and applied quickly due to the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Continuous enhancement, optimization, and evaluation are ongoing.\n\n【105】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【106】A framework for efficient, scalable, and sustainable contact tracing of COVID-19 has been implemented successfully in a multistate large health system setting.

We evaluated the association between cost sharing and the total number of CR sessions attended as well as the influence of household income on CR attendance.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In 2015, 603 patients enrolled in CR had complete cost-sharing information. In total, 235 (39%) had some form of cost sharing. Of these, 192 (82%) had co-pays (median co-pay, $20; interquartile range \\[IQR\\], $10-$32) and 79 (34%) had an unmet deductible (median, $500; IQR, $250-$1800). The presence of any amount or form of cost sharing was associated with 6 fewer sessions of CR (16; IQR, 4-36 vs 10; IQR, 4-27; _P_ <.001). Patients hospitalized in November or December with deductibles that renewed in January attended 4.5 fewer sessions of CR (8.5; IQR, 3.25-12.50 vs 13; IQR, 5.25-36.00; _P_ \\=.049). After adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics, every $10 increase in co-pay was associated with 1.5 (95% CI, −2.3 to −0.7) fewer sessions of CR ( _P_ <.001).

The objectives of our research were to (1) estimate the summary association between EPA+DHA intake and CHD risk in prospective cohort studies and (2) examine the effects by dose, by specific CHD outcome, and among higher-risk populations (eg, individuals with elevated triglyceride levels). To this end, we evaluated the currently available and published data across the literature.\n\n【1】The authors raise 2 primary issues in their letter to the editor, both dealing with the design of individual RCTs, which is not the topic addressed in our meta-analysis but still is relevant for the discourse of the state of knowledge on this topic. The first is that there is an absence of discussion pertaining to the recruitment of control groups with low baseline levels of omega-3 EPA+DHA. However, the authors focus their attention on the National Heart Foundation of Australia review, not our meta-analysis. In fact, in our discussion section, we wrote that “most RCTs did not measure baseline intake of EPA+DHA from the diet nor track EPA+DHA intake from sources other than that supplemented during the course of study….” Therefore, it is not clear if the results from the individual trials have been impacted by background dietary EPA+DHA, particularly in the control group. If so, as the authors suggest, and as we indicated in our article, the effects of EPA+DHA on CHD risk may be more protective than what is reported in our meta-analysis. Although most studies undeniably include participants with varying baseline levels of EPA+DHA, the purpose of our meta-analysis was to evaluate the relative difference between individuals with EPA+DHA provision compared with those who did not receive supplemental EPA+DHA. Globally, levels of EPA+DHA in the general population have been considered low\n\n【2】 however, it is unclear whether the participants in the RCTs we analyzed have been recruited from a “healthier” source population with higher baseline levels of EPA+DHA. If so, effects of EPA+DHA supplementation may be attenuated toward the null value. Appropriately, the summary results from our meta-analyses of RCTs should be viewed as conservative.\n\n【3】From a methodological standpoint, it may not be pragmatic to evaluate CHD risk among individuals receiving EPA+DHA compared with an “exposure-free” (ie, no baseline level of EPA+DHA) control population. McLennan and Pepe ask the question of whether an RCT of a β-blocker, or any novel active agent, allows the active drug to be present in the control group. Although we agree with the their position that in most _drug_ trials, the active agent may not—or should not—be present in the control group, EPA+DHA is a dietary factor, not an active drug.\n\n【4】Again, the aim of our meta-analysis was to estimate the _relative difference_ of the effect of EPA+DHA on CHD risk based on the evaluation of participants receiving supplemental EPA+DHA compared with participants not receiving supplemental EPA+DHA. We fully submit that the control groups across the volume of RCTs include participants with varying levels of EPA+DHA. The reality is that we are not evaluating a drug or prescription medication per se but rather a dietary and nutritional constituent present in commonly consumed foods. Thus, the inherent methodology in published studies is a reflection of this fact (as is the case with most RCTs of dietary factors), and the findings across the literature should be interpreted in light of the challenges when attempting to isolate the effects of a single dietary factor on a complex and multifaceted outcome, such as CHD. In other words, unless the exposure is rare and uncommon in the dietary practice of large segments of the population, the control groups in most RCTs of dietary factors typically include participants with a baseline level of exposure. Indeed, McLennan and Pepe indicate that in our analyses, the prospective cohort studies consistently reveal reductions in CHD risk between those eating fish regularly compared with those who consume fish infrequently, and the RCTs do not reproduce these strong findings. This is discussed extensively in our article in which we indicate that prospective cohort studies enable us to evaluate unrestricted populations who may not have modified their dietary habits and medications on entry into the cohort. Furthermore, most prospective cohort studies are longer in duration than RCTs, include a larger study population, and evaluate dietary intake data that may be representative of lifelong eating habits. However, RCTs offer the methodological advantage of control for confounding through random allocation of exposure and a potentially more stringent and regulated follow-up for the occurrence of a CHD event. Each study design provides insight into the relationship between EPA+DHA and CHD, which is why we conducted separate meta-analyses by RCT and prospective cohort designs. Although the statistical magnitude of results differed modestly by study design, results by study type should be considered as complementary, providing support for the role of EPA+DHA on CHD risk reduction.\n\n【5】The second issue that McLennan and Pepe raise is that background omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) dietary intake and baseline red blood cell membrane PUFA should be accounted for in each RCT recruitment. They suggest that if so, we would likely see more than a 6% reduction in CHD risk in our meta-analysis. Although RCT recruitment is beyond the scope of our meta-analysis, we agree that a stronger summary effect may be observed if the margin of difference in EPA+DHA levels between the treatment and control groups was greater. McLennan and Pepe recommend that future RCTs should include patients with verifiable baseline and follow-up measurements of omega-3 PUFA levels. We agree that such methodological rigor at the individual trial level may provide additional insight into the relationship between EPA+DHA and CHD risk.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:08:46", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:09:02", "cost": 15.956}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:36", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:09:02", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:08:46"}

Valvular disease in APS may be severe, and many affected patients are appropriate candidates for valvular replacement surgery.\n\n【7】The perioperative management of patients with APS is complex with an inherent thrombophilia masked by abnormal prolongation of in vitro clotting times, which precludes the use of standard techniques for anticoagulation monitoring during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). In addition, there is often coexistent thrombocytopenia. Decisions regarding the choice of valve, prevention of immediate perioperative bleeding or thrombotic complications, and postoperative anticoagulation in the setting of prolonged baseline clotting times and thrombocytopenia requires a multidisciplinary approach to optimize the chance of a successful outcome. Despite the complexity of this clinical scenario there are relatively few reports on the management of such patients. We present a case report of 1 such patient, discuss her management, and review the current literature.\n\n【8】Report Of A Case\n----------------\n\n【9】A 25-year-old woman presented to our institution in Janu&x00AD; ary 1999 for evaluation of severe aortic insufficiency in the setting of LA, positive anticardiolipin serology, and thrombocytopenia. She complained of dyspnea climbing 1 flight of stairs, orthostatic light-headedness, and mild leg edema. She denied syncope or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Her symptoms began in 1992 when she noted the onset of arthralgias with occasional transient swelling of large joints. There was no history of rheumatic fever or joint deformities, and family history was negative for autoimmune or rheumatologic diseases. Over the subsequent 5 years she developed increasing shortness of breath, palpitations, easy fatigue, and recurrent fleeting paresthesias affecting various body parts. Serologic testing had demonstrated the presence of IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies and was negative for other connective tissue diseases.\n\n【10】删除21:<u>The patient had a number of prior hospitalizations for chest tightness, severe dyspnea, easy fatigability, and expectoration of frothy sputum. In 1995 echocardiography had revealed severe aortic valve incompetence with moderate mitral regurgitation and dilated left atrium and ventricle, with moderate pulmonary hypertension. Angiography confirmed poor left ventricular function with global hypokinesis and an ejection fraction of 25%. In June 1996, she noted the onset of transient motor weakness of her right lower and left upper extremities, which lasted a matter of minutes and disappeared. Serum anticardiolipin antibodies were again noted to be positive in moderate titers (50 GPL units and 40 MPL units), and coagulation testing was positive for LA, although details of the latter testing were not available. Warfarin anticoagulation was begun, which continued for 3 months until she developed hematemesis. Ticlopidine was substituted, and she developed no further episodes of motor dysfunction but had persistent paresthesias. Findings on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were normal. In 1998 she experienced progressively worsening dyspnea and was placed on perindopril. Other history included intermittent menorrhagia, anemia requiring iron supplementation and blood transfusions in 1996 and 1997, and thrombocytopenia recognized in 1995.</u>\n\n【11】Physical examination demonstrated a displaced cardiac apical pulse to the sixth intercostal space with a prominent left ventricular heave. An S3 gallop rhythm with auscultatory findings characteristic of severe aortic incompetence was readily apparent. Echocardiography confirmed severe aortic incompetence with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction at _25%._ It was decided to proceed with aortic valve replacement.\n\n【12】Laboratory testing confirmed microcytic hypochromic anemia (hemoglobin, 10.7 g/dL \\[reference range, 12.015.5 g/dL\\]; mean corpuscular volume, 73 fL \\[82–98 fL\\]) with iron deficiency (serum ferritin, 5 g/L \\[20–200 gIL\\]). Thrombocytopenia was also confirmed (platelet count, 45 × l0 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L \\[150–450 × l0 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L\\]). Antiplatelet antibodies were detected by monoclonal antibody immunocapture assay, both on the patient's platelets (reactive with glycoproteins IIb/llIa, Ib/IX, Ia/IIa) and in the serum (reactive with glycoproteins IIb/IIIa).\n\n【13】Coagulation-related laboratory test results, including antiphospholipid phospholipid antibody findings, are summarized in Table 1 . Lupus anticoagulant was detected and confirmed both by the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and by the dilute Russell viper venom time assay systems. The mildly prolonged prothrombin time (equivalent international normalized ratio, 1.5) likely reflected low-grade LA inhibition, although activities of factors II and × were mildly decreased, reflecting either LA-associated immune-mediated decrease or possible vitamin K deficiency. Prothrombin antibodies are common in patients with LA and may result in hypoprothrombinemia due to clearance of antigen-antibody complexes. The patient's LA also produced marked in vitro activated protein C (APC) resistance. Serum IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were present in moderately high titer, together with low-titer IgM antibodies.\n\n【14】Table 1 Coagulation-Related Laboratory Data\n\n【15】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【16】APC = activated protein C; APTT = activated partial thrombo-plastin time; PNP = platelet neutralization procedure.\n\n| Test | Result | Reference range |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Prothrombin time (s) | 14.5 | 8.4–12.0 |\n| 1:1 Mix | 12.0 | … |\n| APTT (s) | 68 | 21–33 |\n| 1:1 Mix | 50 | … |\n| PNP | 40 | … |\n| PNP control | 53 | … |\n| Thrombin time (s) | 18 | 18–25 |\n| Dilute Russell viper venom time |  |  |\n| Screen ratio | 3.5 | <1.2 |\n| Mix ratio | 2.7 | <1.2 |\n| Confirmatory ratio | 1.9 | <1.2 |\n| Factor II activity (%) | 50 | 70–130 |\n| Factor V activity (%) | 79 | 60–130 |\n| Factor VII activity (%) | 98 | 65–140 |\n| Factor X activity {%) | 55 | 60–130 |\n| APC resistance |  |  |\n| Baseline APTT (s) | 104 | 26–38 |\n| APTT + APC (s) | 149 | 68–137 |\n| APC-resistance ratio | 1.4 | 2.4–4.0 |\n| Anticardiolipin antibody liter |  |  |\n| IgG | 1:128 | Negative (<1:4) |\n| IgM | 1:8 | Negative (<1:4) |\n\n【18】\\* APC = activated protein C; APTT = activated partial thrombo-plastin time; PNP = platelet neutralization procedure.\n\n【19】Negative or normal coagulation testing results included plasma fibrinogen, plasminogen, antithrombin, protein C, protein S, fibrin D dimer and homocysteine, and absence by DNA-based testing of the factor V R506Q (Leiden) mutation (APC resistance) and the prothrombin nucleotide G20210A mutation. Other laboratory testing demonstrated hypocomplementemia: total complement, 11 U/L (30–75 U/L); C3 complement component, 33 mg/dL (70–150 mg/dL); and C4 complement component, less than 10 mg/dL (14–40 mg/dL). The serum creatinine level was increased to 1.3 to 1.7 mg/dL (0.6–0.9 mg/dL), associated with proteinuria (24-hour urinary protein level, 602 mg \\[27–93 mg\\]). Normal or nondiagnostic results were obtained for the following tests: serum protein electrophoresis, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antibodies to double-stranded DNA or to extractable nuclear antigen, and serum cryoglobulins.\n\n【20】### Preoperative Testing\n\n【21】During CPB for valve replacement surgery, high-dose heparin therapy is usually monitored by periodic measurement of the activated clotting time (ACT). The ACT is a test of whole blood that uses a strong contact activator of the intrinsic coagulation system, either celite or kaolin. As a result, the test is linearly responsive to the high concentrations of heparin used during bypass (1–5 U/mL). The usual monitoring protocol consists of a baseline ACT followed by a bolus dose of heparin; the baseline ACT should be shorter than 200 seconds and the postheparinization ACT should be longer than 450 seconds prior to the onset of CPB. The ACT is repeated every 15 to 20 minutes; if the result is less than 450 seconds, additional heparin is administered. At the completion of CPB, the heparin is neutralized with protamine, and the ACT is performed again to ensure that it has returned to baseline levels.\n\n【22】Because the basic principles of the APTT and the ACT are very similar, concern was raised regarding the potential impact of this patient's LA on the heparin monitoring protocol. A prior case report'demonstrated that the kaolin ACT was prolonged in a patient with antiphospholipid antibodies and that alternative heparin monitoring was performed instead. Therefore, preoperative testing was performed to determine if the ACT would be affected and whether the heparin monitoring protocol would need to be modified.\n\n【23】The following testing was performed several days preoperatively with use of fresh whole blood and/or samples of whole blood obtained from the patient to which 2, 3, or 4 U of heparin were added in vitro: celite ACT using a Hemochron 401 instrument (International Technidyne Corp, Edison, NJ); kaolin ACT using the Hepcon HMS instrument (Medtronic, HemoTec Inc, Parker, Colo); heparin dose response test using the Hepcon HMS instrument (in which native whole blood is added to a 6-channel kaolin ACT cartridge containing heparin \\[0, 1.5, or 2.5 U/mL\\]); heparin protamine titration test using the Hepcon HMS instrument (to measure heparin concentration using the ACT and a semiquantitative protamine titration method); and chromogenic substrate heparin assay (anti-Xa method) using an STA instrument (American Bioproducts/Diagnostica Stago, Parsippany, NJ) and reagents from the same manufacturer.\n\n【24】The preoperative test results  showed that, for this patient, the kaolin ACT was greatly prolonged with native whole blood and was outside the instrument's reportable range with heparinized whole blood. The celite ACT was also prolonged at baseline but showed some dose responsiveness to heparin added in vitro. The heparin dose response assay is normally used as a preoperative assess&x00AD; _ment_ of an individual patient's responsiveness to heparin.\n\n【25】Table 2 Preoperative Assessment of In Vitro Heparin Effects in the Case Patient\n\n【26】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【27】ACT = activated clotting time.\n\n| Test | Heparin concentration | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ACT |  |  |\n| Kaolin | None | 290 s†Kaolin ACT reference range, 99–135 s. |\n|  | 3 U/mL | \\>999 s |\n| Celite | None | 251 s‡Celite ACT reference range, ! 20–196 s (cardiovascular patients). |\n|  | 2 U/mL | 646 s |\n|  | 3 U/mL | 826 s |\n|  | 4 U/mL | \\>1500 s |\n| Heparin dose response | 1.5 U/mL | \\>999 s |\n|  | 2.5 U/mL | \\>999 s |\n| Heparin assay |  |  |\n| Prolamine titration | 3 U/mL | 2.7 U/mL |\n| Anti-Xa | None | 0 U/mL |\n|  | 2 U/mL | 2.70 U/mL |\n|  | 3 U/mL | 4.80 U/mL |\n|  | 4 U/mL | 5.60 U/mL |\n\n【29】\\* ACT = activated clotting time.\n\n【30】† Kaolin ACT reference range, 99–135 s.\n\n【31】‡ Celite ACT reference range, ! 20–196 s (cardiovascular patients).\n\n【32】It is designed to be prolonged about 100 seconds from baseline for each unit per milliliter of heparin concentration in a typical patient. The results of the test at 0, 1.5, and 2.5 U/mL of heparin are used to create a response curve. The concentration of heparin that produces a kaolin ACT longer than 480 seconds is then estimated, and that concentration is used as the goal during CPB. In this patient, the results of the kaolin ACT at both 1.5 and 2.5 U/mL of heparin were longer than 999 seconds, rendering the test invalid for clinical use. The heparin protamine titration assay did not seem to be adversely affected by LA, thus confirming the findings previously reported.\n\n【33】The 2 heparin assays (heparin protamine titration and chromogenic anti-Xa) showed similar trends, but the results were not the same. These differences are most likely due to the methods; the anti-Xa assay is known to produce higher results compared with the protamine titration method.\n\n【34】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【35】College of American Pathologists Conference XXXI on laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant therapy: laboratory monitoring of unfractionaled heparin therapy.\n\n【36】Based on these results, the heparin protamine titration assay was selected for the intraoperative monitoring protocol; 3.4 U/mL (2.5 mg/kg) was chosen as the target heparin concentration during CPB. Concurrent kaolin and celite ACT assays and the chromogenic anti-Xa heparin assay were also performed intraoperatively to compare the results of in vivo heparinization with the results from the preoperative in vitro studies.\n\n【37】### Perioperative Management\n\n【38】In view of the substantial thrombocytopenia, intravenous immunoglobulin was administered 4 days before surgery. This resulted in a rise in the platelet count from 45 to 124 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L. Prior to the induction of anesthesia, standard monitoring for cardiac surgery requiring CPB was instituted, including radial arterial, central venous, and pulmo&x00AD; nary arterial catheterization. The patient weighed 48.3 kg with body surface area of 1.46 m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> . Samples for coagulation tests were collected from the radial arterial catheter after 10 mL of blood had been discarded. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with thiopental, midazolam, fentanyl, pancuronium, and isoflurane. Prior to the initial surgical incision, coagulation tests were done, as outlined in Table 3 , as well as prothrombin time (13.3 seconds) and APTT (63 seconds) determinations, thromboelastogram (TEG), and platelet count (94 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L).\n\n【39】Following sternotomy, 18,000 U of heparin was administered prior to cannulation of the aorta. The protamine titration assay indicated a level of greater than 4.1 U/mL  prior to initiation of CPB. Cardiopulmonary bypass was maintained with a membrane oxygenator primed with 2 U of packed red blood cells (RBCs), 10,000 U of heparin, mannitol, sodium bicarbonate, and physiologic plasma electrolyte solution (Plasmalyte) for a total volume of 2 L. During CPB, a heparin level of 2.7 U/mL was detected by protamine titration, requiring the administration of an additional 5000 U of heparin to achieve a heparin level higher than the targeted nadir of 2.5 to 3.0 U/mL. The aortic valve  was replaced with a Carpentier-Edwards bioprosthetic valve during 28 minutes of aortic cross-clamping; the total CPB duration was 36 minutes during which time the patient remained normothermic.\n\n【40】Table 3 Intraoperative Heparin Monitoring\n\n【41】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【42】ACT = activated clotting time; ND = not done.\n\n|  | Heparin assay | ACT (s) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Time | Protamine titration method (U/mL) | Anti-Xa method (U/mL) | Kaolin | Celite |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Before heparinizaiion | 0 | 0 | 249 | 192 |\n| After heparin bolus given | \\>4.1 | 7.05 | \\>999 | \\>1500 |\n| After initiation of bypass | 2.7 | 4.95 | \\>700 | \\>1500 |\n| Before protamine neutralization | 3.4 | 5.65 | ND | ND |\n| After protamine neutralization | 0 | 0 | 152 | 140 |\n\n【44】\\* ACT = activated clotting time; ND = not done.\n\n【45】Figure 1 Gross photograph of resected aortic valve, showing aortic aspect.

Right, Organizing thrombotic vegetation characteristic of primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification x120).\n\n【47】After termination of CPB, 200 mg of protamine was given to neutralize the heparin. The patient became hypotensive to a systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg and developed rapid atrial fibrillation at 160 beats/min; however, she was rapidly stabilized with epinephrine and fluids. After hemodynamic stability was achieved (10 minutes after protamine administration), there was no evidence of circulating heparin according to protamine titration, but the surgical field demonstrated evidence of microvascular bleeding. Arterial blood gas testing demonstrated a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL. Compared with preoperative assessment, the TEG demonstrated a reduction of the maximal amplitude to 45.5 mm (43–64 mm) and an R value of 15 mm (13–26 mm). The pattern of the TEG, in conjunction with the microvascular bleeding, prompted the transfusion of platelets. There was no evidence of abnormal fibrinolysis on the TEG. Microvascular bleeding improved after administration of 3 U (225 mL) of cell-salvaged blood and 6 U of platelets. The patient arrived in the intensive care unit (ICU) in stable condition. She was extubated without difficulty and required initial inotropic support, which was weaned uneventfully. Blood loss in the ICU was minimal, and 2 U of packed RBCs were given over the next 24 hours. An additional dose of intravenous immunoglobulin was infused on the first postoperative day. The postoperative platelet count stabilized at 65 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L, and aspirin, 325 mg/d, was prescribed for postoperative antithrombotic prophylaxis. She subsequently had an uneventful postoperative course.\n\n【48】### Follow-Up\n\n【49】At follow-up evaluation 17 months after surgery, clinical and echocardiographic examinations demonstrated satisfactory aortic valve function with improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction from 25% preoperatively to 62% postoperatively. There was no change in the antiphospholipid antibodies, and the platelet count was 90 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Antiphospholipid antibodies were initially discovered 50 years ago\n\n【52】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【53】because of their interference with phospholipid-dependent clotting time assays. They were identified in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and initially were believed to cause a hemorrhagic disorder, therefore receiving the misnomer “lupus anticoagulants.” In 1963, Bowie et al\n\n【54】noted the association between these inhibitors and thrombotic diatheses. They described 4 patients with SLE who had prolonged, inhibited clotting times and thrombotic manifestations. It was subsequently realized that many individuals existed with these findings in the absence of SLE. Further investigation revealed that there was a wide variety of anti phospholipid antibodies with a spectrum of in vitro activity. Many were found to have activity directed against a complex of phospholipid and proteins such as &x007E;2- glycoprotein I\n\n【55】or prothrombin (factor II).\n\n【56】The biologic diversity of antiphospholipid antibodies led to a variety of assays for detection and quantification. These include functional assays of LA activity and immunologically based assays (eg, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) to detect anticardiolipin antibodies. Assays of LA activity are based on the in vitro prolongation of clotting times by inhibition of the phospholipid required by these techniques.\n\n【57】Both types of assays (functional and immunological) are important for optimal diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibodies, and many laboratories rely on more than 1 functional assay technique to optimize sensitivity of detection of LAs.\n\n【58】Antiphospholipid antibodies are considered to be more than an epiphenomenon in many patients, with evidence to suggest a causal role for some of the manifestations of the disease. The pathogenesis of valve disease is unclear; however, valvular thrombosis has been seen on structurally normal valves.\n\n【59】The incidence of valvular disease in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome has been shown to be 32% to 36% in 2 prospective transthoracic echocardiographic studies.\n\n【60】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【61】The aortic and mitral valves are most commonly affected with pathology ranging from leaflet thickening to valvular regurgitation. When transesophageal echocardiography is used, this incidence may be as high as 75%.\n\n【62】Brenner et al <sup>l5 </sup> performed a prospective echocardiographic evaluation on 34 consecutive patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Valvular abnormalities were observed in 32% of these individuals and were much more frequent in patients suffering arterial thrombosis (64%) compared with those with venous thrombosis (17 %) or recurrent fetal loss (7 %).\n\n【63】Thrombocytopenia is well recognized in patients with APS; the prevalence was 26% among 293 patients enrolled in the Italian Registry of Antiphospholipid Antibodies.\n\n【64】There were 32 patients (11 _%)_ with substantial thrombocytopenia (<50 × 10\n\n【65】/L), and 2 of these patients had severe bleeding complications. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the pathophysiology and optimal management of thrombocytopenia in these patients. Antibodies against glycoproteins IIb/IIIa, Ib/IX, and Ia/IIa were present in our patient and are found in approximately 40% of antiphospholipid antibody-positive patients,\n\n【66】similar to their prevalence in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n【67】Interestingly, immunosuppressive therapy reduces the titers of platelet -associated IgG and increases the platelet count, but the antiphospholipid antibody titers often remain unaffected,\n\n【68】Prevalence and clinical significance of elevated antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n【69】suggesting that platelet-specific antibodies may be responsible for the thrombocytopenia. On the basis of these observations, it was elected to administer preoperative and postoperative intravenous immunoglobulin, as the evidence to date suggests that thrombocytopenia in this setting should be managed like idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura when treatment is necessary.\n\n【70】Intraoperative heparin monitoring during CPB may be challenging in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. The activated clotting time can be markedly affected and thus not suitable as a guide to the adequacy of heparin anticoagulation. Although anecdotal success has been reported with empiric heparin management during CPB,\n\n【71】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【72】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【73】Operation for chronic pulmonary thromboembolism accompanied by thrombophilia in 8 patients.\n\n【74】we advocate a more controlled approach with preoperative in vitro testing to determine the most accurate assay for heparin monitoring. A blind approach could lead to insufficient heparin dosing resulting in potentially lifethreatening hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. In our patient, heparin assay by protamine titration was an acceptable alternative to either the kaolin or the celite ACT and has been used effectively by others.\n\n【75】The anti-Xa method for assaying heparin provides reliable results but lacks practicality for use in the operating room.\n\n【76】The choice of prosthetic valve remains an important consideration in APS patients. It was felt that a bioprosthetic valve would offer advantages over a mechanical valve in our patient, as postoperative monitoring of oral anticoagulation may be complex in the presence of prolonged in vitro clotting times due to the presence of an inhibitor and coexistent hypoprothrombinemia, and anticoagulation in thrombocytopenic individuals likely has hemorrhagic risk proportionate to severity of thrombocytopenia.

Thrombocytopenia was also confirmed (platelet count, 45 × l0 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L \\[150–450 × l0 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L\\]). Antiplatelet antibodies were detected by monoclonal antibody immunocapture assay, both on the patient's platelets (reactive with glycoproteins IIb/llIa, Ib/IX, Ia/IIa) and in the serum (reactive with glycoproteins IIb/IIIa).\n\n【13】Coagulation-related laboratory test results, including antiphospholipid phospholipid antibody findings, are summarized in Table 1 . Lupus anticoagulant was detected and confirmed both by the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and by the dilute Russell viper venom time assay systems. The mildly prolonged prothrombin time (equivalent international normalized ratio, 1.5) likely reflected low-grade LA inhibition, although activities of factors II and × were mildly decreased, reflecting either LA-associated immune-mediated decrease or possible vitamin K deficiency. Prothrombin antibodies are common in patients with LA and may result in hypoprothrombinemia due to clearance of antigen-antibody complexes. The patient's LA also produced marked in vitro activated protein C (APC) resistance. Serum IgG anticardiolipin antibodies were present in moderately high titer, together with low-titer IgM antibodies.\n\n【14】Table 1 Coagulation-Related Laboratory Data\n\n【15】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【16】APC = activated protein C; APTT = activated partial thrombo-plastin time; PNP = platelet neutralization procedure.\n\n| Test | Result | Reference range |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Prothrombin time (s) | 14.5 | 8.4–12.0 |\n| 1:1 Mix | 12.0 | … |\n| APTT (s) | 68 | 21–33 |\n| 1:1 Mix | 50 | … |\n| PNP | 40 | … |\n| PNP control | 53 | … |\n| Thrombin time (s) | 18 | 18–25 |\n| Dilute Russell viper venom time |  |  |\n| Screen ratio | 3.5 | <1.2 |\n| Mix ratio | 2.7 | <1.2 |\n| Confirmatory ratio | 1.9 | <1.2 |\n| Factor II activity (%) | 50 | 70–130 |\n| Factor V activity (%) | 79 | 60–130 |\n| Factor VII activity (%) | 98 | 65–140 |\n| Factor X activity {%) | 55 | 60–130 |\n| APC resistance |  |  |\n| Baseline APTT (s) | 104 | 26–38 |\n| APTT + APC (s) | 149 | 68–137 |\n| APC-resistance ratio | 1.4 | 2.4–4.0 |\n| Anticardiolipin antibody liter |  |  |\n| IgG | 1:128 | Negative (<1:4) |\n| IgM | 1:8 | Negative (<1:4) |\n\n【18】\\* APC = activated protein C; APTT = activated partial thrombo-plastin time; PNP = platelet neutralization procedure.\n\n【19】Negative or normal coagulation testing results included plasma fibrinogen, plasminogen, antithrombin, protein C, protein S, fibrin D dimer and homocysteine, and absence by DNA-based testing of the factor V R506Q (Leiden) mutation (APC resistance) and the prothrombin nucleotide G20210A mutation. Other laboratory testing demonstrated hypocomplementemia: total complement, 11 U/L (30–75 U/L); C3 complement component, 33 mg/dL (70–150 mg/dL); and C4 complement component, less than 10 mg/dL (14–40 mg/dL). The serum creatinine level was increased to 1.3 to 1.7 mg/dL (0.6–0.9 mg/dL), associated with proteinuria (24-hour urinary protein level, 602 mg \\[27–93 mg\\]). Normal or nondiagnostic results were obtained for the following tests: serum protein electrophoresis, C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, antibodies to double-stranded DNA or to extractable nuclear antigen, and serum cryoglobulins.\n\n【20】### Preoperative Testing\n\n【21】During CPB for valve replacement surgery, high-dose heparin therapy is usually monitored by periodic measurement of the activated clotting time (ACT). The ACT is a test of whole blood that uses a strong contact activator of the intrinsic coagulation system, either celite or kaolin. As a result, the test is linearly responsive to the high concentrations of heparin used during bypass (1–5 U/mL). The usual monitoring protocol consists of a baseline ACT followed by a bolus dose of heparin; the baseline ACT should be shorter than 200 seconds and the postheparinization ACT should be longer than 450 seconds prior to the onset of CPB. The ACT is repeated every 15 to 20 minutes; if the result is less than 450 seconds, additional heparin is administered. At the completion of CPB, the heparin is neutralized with protamine, and the ACT is performed again to ensure that it has returned to baseline levels.\n\n【22】Because the basic principles of the APTT and the ACT are very similar, concern was raised regarding the potential impact of this patient's LA on the heparin monitoring protocol. A prior case report'demonstrated that the kaolin ACT was prolonged in a patient with antiphospholipid antibodies and that alternative heparin monitoring was performed instead. Therefore, preoperative testing was performed to determine if the ACT would be affected and whether the heparin monitoring protocol would need to be modified.\n\n【23】The following testing was performed several days preoperatively with use of fresh whole blood and/or samples of whole blood obtained from the patient to which 2, 3, or 4 U of heparin were added in vitro: celite ACT using a Hemochron 401 instrument (International Technidyne Corp, Edison, NJ); kaolin ACT using the Hepcon HMS instrument (Medtronic, HemoTec Inc, Parker, Colo); heparin dose response test using the Hepcon HMS instrument (in which native whole blood is added to a 6-channel kaolin ACT cartridge containing heparin \\[0, 1.5, or 2.5 U/mL\\]); heparin protamine titration test using the Hepcon HMS instrument (to measure heparin concentration using the ACT and a semiquantitative protamine titration method); and chromogenic substrate heparin assay (anti-Xa method) using an STA instrument (American Bioproducts/Diagnostica Stago, Parsippany, NJ) and reagents from the same manufacturer.\n\n【24】The preoperative test results  showed that, for this patient, the kaolin ACT was greatly prolonged with native whole blood and was outside the instrument's reportable range with heparinized whole blood. The celite ACT was also prolonged at baseline but showed some dose responsiveness to heparin added in vitro. The heparin dose response assay is normally used as a preoperative assess&x00AD; _ment_ of an individual patient's responsiveness to heparin.\n\n【25】Table 2 Preoperative Assessment of In Vitro Heparin Effects in the Case Patient\n\n【26】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【27】ACT = activated clotting time.\n\n| Test | Heparin concentration | Result |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ACT |  |  |\n| Kaolin | None | 290 s†Kaolin ACT reference range, 99–135 s. |\n|  | 3 U/mL | \\>999 s |\n| Celite | None | 251 s‡Celite ACT reference range, ! 20–196 s (cardiovascular patients). |\n|  | 2 U/mL | 646 s |\n|  | 3 U/mL | 826 s |\n|  | 4 U/mL | \\>1500 s |\n| Heparin dose response | 1.5 U/mL | \\>999 s |\n|  | 2.5 U/mL | \\>999 s |\n| Heparin assay |  |  |\n| Prolamine titration | 3 U/mL | 2.7 U/mL |\n| Anti-Xa | None | 0 U/mL |\n|  | 2 U/mL | 2.70 U/mL |\n|  | 3 U/mL | 4.80 U/mL |\n|  | 4 U/mL | 5.60 U/mL |\n\n【29】\\* ACT = activated clotting time.\n\n【30】† Kaolin ACT reference range, 99–135 s.\n\n【31】‡ Celite ACT reference range, ! 20–196 s (cardiovascular patients).\n\n【32】It is designed to be prolonged about 100 seconds from baseline for each unit per milliliter of heparin concentration in a typical patient. The results of the test at 0, 1.5, and 2.5 U/mL of heparin are used to create a response curve. The concentration of heparin that produces a kaolin ACT longer than 480 seconds is then estimated, and that concentration is used as the goal during CPB. In this patient, the results of the kaolin ACT at both 1.5 and 2.5 U/mL of heparin were longer than 999 seconds, rendering the test invalid for clinical use. The heparin protamine titration assay did not seem to be adversely affected by LA, thus confirming the findings previously reported.\n\n【33】The 2 heparin assays (heparin protamine titration and chromogenic anti-Xa) showed similar trends, but the results were not the same. These differences are most likely due to the methods; the anti-Xa assay is known to produce higher results compared with the protamine titration method.\n\n【34】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【35】College of American Pathologists Conference XXXI on laboratory monitoring of anticoagulant therapy: laboratory monitoring of unfractionaled heparin therapy.\n\n【36】Based on these results, the heparin protamine titration assay was selected for the intraoperative monitoring protocol; 3.4 U/mL (2.5 mg/kg) was chosen as the target heparin concentration during CPB. Concurrent kaolin and celite ACT assays and the chromogenic anti-Xa heparin assay were also performed intraoperatively to compare the results of in vivo heparinization with the results from the preoperative in vitro studies.\n\n【37】### Perioperative Management\n\n【38】In view of the substantial thrombocytopenia, intravenous immunoglobulin was administered 4 days before surgery. This resulted in a rise in the platelet count from 45 to 124 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L. Prior to the induction of anesthesia, standard monitoring for cardiac surgery requiring CPB was instituted, including radial arterial, central venous, and pulmo&x00AD; nary arterial catheterization. The patient weighed 48.3 kg with body surface area of 1.46 m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> . Samples for coagulation tests were collected from the radial arterial catheter after 10 mL of blood had been discarded. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with thiopental, midazolam, fentanyl, pancuronium, and isoflurane. Prior to the initial surgical incision, coagulation tests were done, as outlined in Table 3 , as well as prothrombin time (13.3 seconds) and APTT (63 seconds) determinations, thromboelastogram (TEG), and platelet count (94 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L).\n\n【39】Following sternotomy, 18,000 U of heparin was administered prior to cannulation of the aorta. The protamine titration assay indicated a level of greater than 4.1 U/mL  prior to initiation of CPB. Cardiopulmonary bypass was maintained with a membrane oxygenator primed with 2 U of packed red blood cells (RBCs), 10,000 U of heparin, mannitol, sodium bicarbonate, and physiologic plasma electrolyte solution (Plasmalyte) for a total volume of 2 L. During CPB, a heparin level of 2.7 U/mL was detected by protamine titration, requiring the administration of an additional 5000 U of heparin to achieve a heparin level higher than the targeted nadir of 2.5 to 3.0 U/mL. The aortic valve  was replaced with a Carpentier-Edwards bioprosthetic valve during 28 minutes of aortic cross-clamping; the total CPB duration was 36 minutes during which time the patient remained normothermic.\n\n【40】Table 3 Intraoperative Heparin Monitoring\n\n【41】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【42】ACT = activated clotting time; ND = not done.\n\n|  | Heparin assay | ACT (s) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Time | Protamine titration method (U/mL) | Anti-Xa method (U/mL) | Kaolin | Celite |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Before heparinizaiion | 0 | 0 | 249 | 192 |\n| After heparin bolus given | \\>4.1 | 7.05 | \\>999 | \\>1500 |\n| After initiation of bypass | 2.7 | 4.95 | \\>700 | \\>1500 |\n| Before protamine neutralization | 3.4 | 5.65 | ND | ND |\n| After protamine neutralization | 0 | 0 | 152 | 140 |\n\n【44】\\* ACT = activated clotting time; ND = not done.\n\n【45】Figure 1 Gross photograph of resected aortic valve, showing aortic aspect.

The patient became hypotensive to a systolic pressure of 60 mm Hg and developed rapid atrial fibrillation at 160 beats/min; however, she was rapidly stabilized with epinephrine and fluids. After hemodynamic stability was achieved (10 minutes after protamine administration), there was no evidence of circulating heparin according to protamine titration, but the surgical field demonstrated evidence of microvascular bleeding. Arterial blood gas testing demonstrated a hemoglobin level of 9.5 g/dL. Compared with preoperative assessment, the TEG demonstrated a reduction of the maximal amplitude to 45.5 mm (43–64 mm) and an R value of 15 mm (13–26 mm). The pattern of the TEG, in conjunction with the microvascular bleeding, prompted the transfusion of platelets. There was no evidence of abnormal fibrinolysis on the TEG. Microvascular bleeding improved after administration of 3 U (225 mL) of cell-salvaged blood and 6 U of platelets. The patient arrived in the intensive care unit (ICU) in stable condition. She was extubated without difficulty and required initial inotropic support, which was weaned uneventfully. Blood loss in the ICU was minimal, and 2 U of packed RBCs were given over the next 24 hours. An additional dose of intravenous immunoglobulin was infused on the first postoperative day. The postoperative platelet count stabilized at 65 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L, and aspirin, 325 mg/d, was prescribed for postoperative antithrombotic prophylaxis. She subsequently had an uneventful postoperative course.\n\n【48】### Follow-Up\n\n【49】At follow-up evaluation 17 months after surgery, clinical and echocardiographic examinations demonstrated satisfactory aortic valve function with improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction from 25% preoperatively to 62% postoperatively. There was no change in the antiphospholipid antibodies, and the platelet count was 90 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L.\n\n【50】Discussion\n----------\n\n【51】Antiphospholipid antibodies were initially discovered 50 years ago\n\n【52】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【53】because of their interference with phospholipid-dependent clotting time assays. They were identified in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and initially were believed to cause a hemorrhagic disorder, therefore receiving the misnomer “lupus anticoagulants.” In 1963, Bowie et al\n\n【54】noted the association between these inhibitors and thrombotic diatheses. They described 4 patients with SLE who had prolonged, inhibited clotting times and thrombotic manifestations. It was subsequently realized that many individuals existed with these findings in the absence of SLE. Further investigation revealed that there was a wide variety of anti phospholipid antibodies with a spectrum of in vitro activity. Many were found to have activity directed against a complex of phospholipid and proteins such as &x007E;2- glycoprotein I\n\n【55】or prothrombin (factor II).\n\n【56】The biologic diversity of antiphospholipid antibodies led to a variety of assays for detection and quantification. These include functional assays of LA activity and immunologically based assays (eg, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) to detect anticardiolipin antibodies. Assays of LA activity are based on the in vitro prolongation of clotting times by inhibition of the phospholipid required by these techniques.\n\n【57】Both types of assays (functional and immunological) are important for optimal diagnosis of antiphospholipid antibodies, and many laboratories rely on more than 1 functional assay technique to optimize sensitivity of detection of LAs.\n\n【58】Antiphospholipid antibodies are considered to be more than an epiphenomenon in many patients, with evidence to suggest a causal role for some of the manifestations of the disease. The pathogenesis of valve disease is unclear; however, valvular thrombosis has been seen on structurally normal valves.\n\n【59】The incidence of valvular disease in patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome has been shown to be 32% to 36% in 2 prospective transthoracic echocardiographic studies.\n\n【60】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【61】The aortic and mitral valves are most commonly affected with pathology ranging from leaflet thickening to valvular regurgitation. When transesophageal echocardiography is used, this incidence may be as high as 75%.\n\n【62】Brenner et al <sup>l5 </sup> performed a prospective echocardiographic evaluation on 34 consecutive patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Valvular abnormalities were observed in 32% of these individuals and were much more frequent in patients suffering arterial thrombosis (64%) compared with those with venous thrombosis (17 %) or recurrent fetal loss (7 %).\n\n【63】Thrombocytopenia is well recognized in patients with APS; the prevalence was 26% among 293 patients enrolled in the Italian Registry of Antiphospholipid Antibodies.\n\n【64】There were 32 patients (11 _%)_ with substantial thrombocytopenia (<50 × 10\n\n【65】/L), and 2 of these patients had severe bleeding complications. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the pathophysiology and optimal management of thrombocytopenia in these patients. Antibodies against glycoproteins IIb/IIIa, Ib/IX, and Ia/IIa were present in our patient and are found in approximately 40% of antiphospholipid antibody-positive patients,\n\n【66】similar to their prevalence in idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n【67】Interestingly, immunosuppressive therapy reduces the titers of platelet -associated IgG and increases the platelet count, but the antiphospholipid antibody titers often remain unaffected,\n\n【68】Prevalence and clinical significance of elevated antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n【69】suggesting that platelet-specific antibodies may be responsible for the thrombocytopenia. On the basis of these observations, it was elected to administer preoperative and postoperative intravenous immunoglobulin, as the evidence to date suggests that thrombocytopenia in this setting should be managed like idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura when treatment is necessary.\n\n【70】Intraoperative heparin monitoring during CPB may be challenging in patients with antiphospholipid antibodies. The activated clotting time can be markedly affected and thus not suitable as a guide to the adequacy of heparin anticoagulation. Although anecdotal success has been reported with empiric heparin management during CPB,\n\n【71】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【72】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【73】Operation for chronic pulmonary thromboembolism accompanied by thrombophilia in 8 patients.\n\n【74】we advocate a more controlled approach with preoperative in vitro testing to determine the most accurate assay for heparin monitoring. A blind approach could lead to insufficient heparin dosing resulting in potentially lifethreatening hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. In our patient, heparin assay by protamine titration was an acceptable alternative to either the kaolin or the celite ACT and has been used effectively by others.\n\n【75】The anti-Xa method for assaying heparin provides reliable results but lacks practicality for use in the operating room.\n\n【76】The choice of prosthetic valve remains an important consideration in APS patients. It was felt that a bioprosthetic valve would offer advantages over a mechanical valve in our patient, as postoperative monitoring of oral anticoagulation may be complex in the presence of prolonged in vitro clotting times due to the presence of an inhibitor and coexistent hypoprothrombinemia, and anticoagulation in thrombocytopenic individuals likely has hemorrhagic risk proportionate to severity of thrombocytopenia. As discussed, the perioperative management of APS patients is complex, often requiring a multidisciplinary approach combined with innovative laboratory techniques to optimize the chance of a successful outcome.", "index": 3913, "show": true, "start": 3913, "end": 5277, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:30:40", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:31:39", "cost": 58.68}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:36", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:31:38", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:30:39"}

As a result, neurohormonal pathways are up-regulated, including the sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and vasopressin (or antidiuretic hormone) axis. Temporarily, mean arterial pressure and cardiac output increase to levels adequate for tissue perfusion; however, chronic neurohormonal activation is eventually deleterious, leading to salt and water retention and subsequent worsening of cardiac output.\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】Ultimately, excessive activation manifests with the familiar signs and symptoms of volume overload—the leading cause of ADHF hospitalizations.\n\n【26】In this review, we focus on treatments to remove excess fluid and prevent its accumulation in patients with HF, emphasizing recent clinical trials.

We also reviewed relevant references cited in the obtained articles, especially articles addressing methods of treating or preventing volume overload in patients with HF.\n\n【27】Strategies for Fluid Removal\n----------------------------\n\n【28】### Diuretic Therapy\n\n【29】Diuretics are the mainstay of therapy in patients with congestive HF. Loop diuretics, which inhibit the Na-K-2Cl transport symporter, leading to decreased sodium absorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle, are most commonly used. If loop diuretics are not sufficient, additional synergistic diuretics that affect either the NaCl cotransporter (thiazides) or the renal mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone antagonists) are used.\n\n【30】#### Loop Diuretics\n\n【31】Loop diuretics, which include furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, and ethacrynic acid, are all generic. In the United States, furosemide was introduced much earlier than bumetanide and torsemide and is most commonly used. As a result, 87% of inpatients with ADHF are treated with furosemide, 3% with bumetanide, 0.4% with torsemide, and 10% with a combination of synergistic diuretics.\n\n【32】Dominance of furosemide for loop diuretic therapy in heart failure: time to revisit the alternatives?\n\n【33】Comparatively, loop diuretics are structurally similar, except for ethacrynic acid, which lacks a sulfa moiety. However, it is associated with a greater risk of ototoxicity, relegating its use to patients with allergies to sulfa-containing medications.\n\n【34】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【35】The other loop diuretics do have important differences in their pharmacokinetics .

In an open-label trial, 234 hospitalized patients with ADHF were randomized to receive either furosemide or torsemide and continued the same diuretic treatment for 1 year. Despite being a sicker group (ie, more previous admissions for ADHF), the torsemide group had lower ADHF readmission rates (17% vs 32%) and spent fewer days in the hospital (106 vs 296 total days). In addition, the torsemide group had less fatigue but had no change in dyspnea.\n\n【54】Open-label randomized trial of torsemide compared with furosemide therapy for patients with heart failure.\n\n【55】In the outpatient setting, torsemide was examined in the TORIC (Torasemide in Congestive Heart Failure) study, a nonrandomized, open-label, postmarketing, 1-year surveillance trial of 1377 patients that noted decreased overall mortality rates with torsemide use (2.2%) compared with other loop diuretic use (4.5%).\n\n【56】Forty-six percent of torsemide-treated patients also had improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class compared with 37.2% with other diuretic treatments. Finally, adverse electrolyte changes were less, with 3% of the torsemide group requiring potassium supplementation compared with 30% with other diuretics. Because this was a retrospective, nonrandomized study, a prospective, randomized, unblinded study was subsequently performed in 237 outpatients. Compared with furosemide, torsemide improved symptoms (40.2% vs 30.7% improved NYHA class); however, there were no differences in hospitalization or mortality rates.\n\n【57】In addition to the 4 “classic” loop diuretics, there is another, azosemide, with a longer duration of action. Theoretically, azosemide leads to decreased “rebound” activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system compared with shorter-acting diuretics. Clinically, 1 trial showed benefit in 320 patients with HF who were randomized to receive 2 years of treatment with 30 to 60 mg of azosemide vs 20 to 40 mg of daily furosemide, resulting in decreased HF hospitalization rates (hazard ratio, 0.53; _P_ \\=.04), with no change in overall mortality rates.\n\n【58】Superiority of long-acting to short-acting loop diuretics in the treatment of congestive heart failure.\n\n【59】This drug needs more study and is not currently available in the United States.\n\n【60】There remains a paucity of high-quality, double-blind, randomized controlled trial data despite the widespread use of loop diuretics. Comparative trials are urgently needed, especially for furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, and azosemide. In the meantime, we suggest that the available evidence favors torsemide use.\n\n【61】With any loop diuretic, clinicians treating inpatients with ADHF must also decide on a method for intravenous administration—either continuous infusion or intermittent boluses. Compared with intermittent boluses, continuous delivery theoretically leads to lower peak concentrations, less renal dysfunction and neurohormonal activation, and decreased “rebound” sodium and water retention. However, few studies compared the 2 methods until the DOSE (Diuretic Strategies in Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) trial was published in 2011. This trial was a prospective, double-blind trial randomizing 300 patients to receive either continuous vs bolus furosemide therapy and high- vs low-dose furosemide strategies.\n\n【62】Diuretic strategies in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【63】There were no differences in symptoms, creatinine levels, cystatin C levels, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels, likelihood of a switch to oral diuretics at 48 hours, or hospital length of stay in the continuous and bolus arms. At 72 hours, patients treated with the high-dose strategy had more fluid loss (4899 mL vs 3575 mL; _P_ \\=.001) and weight loss, improved dyspnea scores ( _P_ \\=.04), and a trend toward greater reduction in NT-pro-BNP levels (−1822 pg/mL vs −1194 pg/mL; _P_ \\=.06). However, there were no differences in hospital length of stay, mortality, or 60-day readmission rates, and a greater proportion had an increase in creatinine concentration by more than 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4) (23% vs 14%; _P_ \\=.04). Given the overall results of this well-conducted trial, there is no added benefit to routine continuous intravenous infusions over bolus administration of loop diuretics in the treatment of ADHF.\n\n【64】#### Thiazide Diuretics\n\n【65】Thiazide diuretics are typically used for hypertension treatment,\n\n【66】2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8).\n\n【67】but they also can modestly affect volume removal. When added to a loop diuretic, the combination potentiates diuresis due to sequential receptor blockade in the ascending loop of Henle and the distal nephron.\n\n【68】Thiazides are especially useful in patients with long-term loop diuretic use because they help overcome the decreased loop diuretic response caused by hypertrophy of the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule.\n\n【69】Despite these well-known observations, studies supporting combination therapy include few patients and do not compare different therapy combinations.\n\n【70】Oral metolazone plus furosemide for home therapy in patients with refractory heart failure.\n\n【71】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【72】Clinically, combination therapy can cause profound electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia, which requires close monitoring in the inpatient and outpatient settings.\n\n【73】Although there are no comparative data among the thiazide diuretics, metolazone and chlorothiazide tend to be favored, although hydrocholorothiazide and chlorthalidone can also be considered. We recommend metolazone, which should be administered infrequently (ie, 2.5-5 mg every 48 hours) owing to its long half-life. For patients who cannot take oral medications, we favor chlorothiazide (250-500 mg twice daily), which is available in a more expensive intravenous formulation.\n\n【74】#### Aldosterone Antagonists\n\n【75】Table 2 summarizes the data for spironolactone, a nonselective mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, and eplerenone, a newer medication with minimal effects on sex steroid receptors.\n\n【76】Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction.\n\n【77】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【78】The effect of spironolactone on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure: Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study Investigators.\n\n【79】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【80】Eplerenone in patients with systolic heart failure and mild symptoms.\n\n【81】In select patients, low-dose therapy decreases morbidity and mortality when added to standard HF medications owing to cardiac antifibrotic effects and beneficial cardiac remodeling.\n\n【82】Randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of aldosterone antagonism with eplerenone on ventricular remodeling in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.\n\n【83】Furthermore, higher-dose therapy leads to diuresis by blocking renal salt-retaining aldosterone receptors.\n\n【84】In contrast to low-dose therapy, high-dose therapy was evaluated in only 1 trial, which enrolled 100 patients with ADHF to receive either placebo or 50 to 100 mg of spironolactone. By the third day, treatment was associated with decreased edema, orthopnea, and NT-pro-BNP levels (2488 pg/mL vs 1555 pg/mL).\n\n【85】However, there were no differences in length of stay, and renal function worsened (20% in the spironolactone group had a ≥0.3 mg/dL rise in serum creatinine concentration compared with 4%), with no differences in serum potassium levels. Despite being the largest trial of its kind, this was a small study conducted at a single center in Portugal; the assessing physicians were not blinded to the treatment, and patient assignments were not randomized. Therefore, these results call for a definitive, larger, randomized controlled trial.\n\n【86】Table 2 Aldosterone Antagonist Comparison\n\n【87】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【88】AMI = acute myocardial infarction; CHF = congestive heart failure; EF = ejection fraction; HR = hazard ratio; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SCD = sudden cardiac death.\n\n【89】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【90】SI conversion factor: To convert creatinine values to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4.\n\n| Characteristic | Spironolactone | Eplerenone | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n【92】a AMI = acute myocardial infarction; CHF = congestive heart failure; EF = ejection fraction; HR = hazard ratio; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SCD = sudden cardiac death.\n\n【93】b SI conversion factor: To convert creatinine values to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4.\n\n【94】c Caution: estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> or potassium levels of 5.0 mmol/L or greater.\n\n【95】#### Vasopressin Antagonists\n\n【96】Solute-free water diuretics, or aquaretics, work via vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) antagonism and include lixivaptan, tolvaptan, and conivaptan. Although they are mostly used to correct hyponatremia, they have also been evaluated for ADHF treatment owing to their diuretic properties. For tolvaptan, it was first clinically evaluated in the ACTIV in CHF (Acute and Chronic Therapeutic Impact of a Vasopressin Antagonist in Congestive Heart Failure) study, in which 319 hospitalized patients with persistent congestive ADHF were randomized to receive tolvaptan (either 30, 60, or 90 mg/d) or placebo in addition to standard HF therapy. In the first 24 hours, there was a trend toward greater weight loss in the tolvaptan groups ( _P_ <.08 for all groups vs placebo) and increased serum sodium levels, with no adverse changes in potassium levels or renal function.\n\n【97】Improvement in hyponatremia during hospitalization for worsening heart failure is associated with improved outcomes: insights from the Acute and Chronic Therapeutic Impact of a Vasopressin Antagonist in Chronic Heart Failure (ACTIV in CHF) trial.\n\n【98】Subsequently, the much larger, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4133-patient EVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan) trial revealed a benefit with tolvaptan therapy, leading to significant weight reduction and improved dyspnea scores in the first 24 hours, as well as decreasing edema by day 7.\n\n【99】Clinical course of patients with hyponatremia and decompensated systolic heart failure and the effect of vasopressin receptor antagonism with tolvaptan.\n\n【100】Despite the short-term benefits, there were no long-term differences in all-cause mortality or hospitalizations at median follow-up of almost 10 months.\n\n【101】Similar to tolvaptan, lixivaptan has shown potential benefit in diuresis. In 1 study, 42 patients with mild-to-moderate HF were randomized to receive either placebo or 1 of 6 different doses of lixivaptan. There were significant and dose-related increases in urine volume at 24 hours, with the highest lixivaptan dose (400 mg) yielding an average of 3.9 L of urine output compared with 1.8 L with placebo ( _P_ <.01).\n\n【102】Because there are no large-scale trials, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved lixivaptan and is awaiting data from the BALANCE (Treatment of Hyponatremia Based on Lixivaptan in NYHA Class III/IV Cardiac Patient Evaluation) trial, which aims to enroll 650 patients with ADHF and a serum sodium level less than 135 mEq/L (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0).\n\n【103】Rationale and design of the treatment of hyponatremia based on lixivaptan in NYHA class III/IV cardiac patient evaluation (THE BALANCE) study.\n\n【104】Compared with other “vaptans,” conivaptan is unique because it is administered intravenously. Although there are no large studies, conivaptan can improve diuresis when added to loop diuretics. A pilot study in 170 hospitalized patients with worsening ADHF were randomized to receive conivaptan (loading dose plus 2 successive infusions of 40, 80, or 120 mg/d) or placebo in addition to standard loop diuretic therapy. At each dose range, initial urine output was significantly increased at 24 and 48 hours.\n\n【105】However, many patients had infusion-site phlebitis (17.5%-33%, depending on the dose), but there were no other adverse effects, such as changes in vital signs, electrolyte levels, or cardiac rhythms.\n\n【106】In summary, although vaptans may help in the short-term in patients with ADHF and hyponatremia, current studies suggest that they do not decrease mortality rates or have long-term benefits. If used, patients require close monitoring because antidiuretic hormone antagonists can lead to rapid increases in sodium levels.\n\n【107】### Dopamine\n\n【108】Intravenous dopamine induces natriuresis and diuresis by increasing renal vasodilatation and blood flow through activation of renal-specific dopamine (DA) DA <sub>1 </sub> and DA <sub>2 </sub> receptors\n\n【109】Dopamine-1 and dopamine-2 mechanisms in the control of renal function.\n\n【110】and inhibition of proximal tubular Na <sup>+ </sup> /H <sup>+ </sup> and Na <sup>+ </sup> K <sup>+ </sup> ATPase pumps.\n\n【111】Dopamine purportedly selectively activates receptors in a dose-dependent manner, with low doses (2-5 μg/kg per minute) predominantly affecting DA <sub>1 </sub> and DA <sub>2 </sub> receptors and higher doses activating β and then α vasoreceptors.\n\n【112】Dopamine-1 and dopamine-2 mechanisms in the control of renal function.\n\n【113】This physiologic finding inspired the concept of using low-dose (“renal-dose”) dopamine to enhance diuresis in ADHF; however, this strategy has been clinically disappointing. Multiple systematic reviews have noted no meaningful benefits with low-dose dopamine therapy.\n\n【114】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【115】A 2005 meta-analysis of 61 trials encompassing 3259 patients showed no differences in mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, or adverse events. In this study, urine output increased 24% in the first 24 hours.\n\n【116】Because only 1 small study included in these reviews specifically included patients with HF,\n\n【117】3 studies were conducted evaluating low-dose dopamine for ADHF treatment. A retrospective study assessed 116 patients receiving furosemide by continuous infusion coupled with low-dose dopamine or bolus intravenous furosemide alone.\n\n【118】Continuous infusion of furosemide combined with low-dose dopamine compared to intermittent boluses in acutely decompensated heart failure is less nephrotoxic and carries a lower readmission at thirty days.\n\n【119】The patients in the dopamine/continuous furosemide arm had improved renal function, greater diuresis, fewer inpatient hospital days, and reduced 30-day readmission rates. However, the 2 groups had significantly different baseline characteristics, including worse renal function and a higher rate of aldosterone antagonist treatment in the dopamine group. The subsequent DAD-HF (Dopamine in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) study was the first to prospectively randomize patients with ADHF to receive either high-dose intravenous furosemide (20 mg/h) or low-dose intravenous furosemide (5 mg/h) coupled with 8 hours of low-dose dopamine (5 μg/kg per minute).\n\n【120】Impact of dopamine infusion on renal function in hospitalized heart failure patients: results of the Dopamine in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (DAD-HF) Trial.\n\n【121】There were no differences in diuresis, dyspnea scores, inpatient hospital days, mortality rates, renal function, or rehospitalization rates in the 60 patients enrolled in the study. Three years later, the ROSE-AHF (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure) trial supplanted DAD-HF as the largest randomized trial of low-dose dopamine in the HF population.\n\n【122】Low-dose dopamine or low-dose nesiritide in acute heart failure with renal dysfunction: the ROSE acute heart failure randomized trial.\n\n【123】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【124】Targeting the kidney in acute heart failure: can old drugs provide new benefit? Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (ROSE AHF) trial.\n\n【125】In this trial, 360 patients with ADHF and renal dysfunction were randomized to receive diuretics with placebo, low-dose dopamine (2 μg/kg per minute), or low-dose nesiritide for 72 hours. Compared with DAD-HF, ROSE-AHF used dopamine for longer (although at a lower dose), had no variations in diuretic dosing between the groups, and had a much larger study size. In the end, dopamine therapy did not affect urine output or renal function and at 60 days led to no differences in mortality or unscheduled outpatient or inpatient HF-related appointments.\n\n【126】Based on the previously mentioned trials, dopamine’s effect of renal vasodilation has not led to clinical benefits, perhaps due to variability in pharmacologic levels and heterogeneous responses to dopamine. Even in healthy individuals, a stable infusion dose of 3 μg/kg per minute of dopamine leads to unreliable dopamine plasma concentrations, varying between 1800 and 18,300 ng/L.\n\n【127】In patients with renal failure, dopamine’s renal vasodilatory effects are blunted and instead paradoxically increase renal resistance indices.\n\n【128】Similarly, patients with ADHF have reduced effects with dopamine infusion, requiring much higher–than-expected doses (4-6 μg/kg per minute) to augment peak renal blood flow and reduce renal vascular resistance. Furthermore, the sickest patients (NYHA class IV) have no dopamine-associated changes in renal vascular resistance or the fraction of cardiac output dedicated to renal perfusion.\n\n【129】Renal, but not systemic, hemodynamic effects of dopamine are influenced by the severity of congestive heart failure.\n\n【130】Therefore, dopamine’s pharmacologic effects seem least effective in patients with severe ADHF or renal failure, likely at least partly explaining the observed lack of clinical benefit.\n\n【131】As summarized in Table 3 , the routine use of dopamine for augmented diuresis or renal protection is not supported by recent studies. In patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, it is reasonable to use dopamine only transiently to increase blood pressure and cardiac output.\n\n【132】### Nesiritide\n\n【133】The effects of BNP seem perfectly tailored to therapeutic exploitation: augmented natriuresis, sympatholysis, antiproliferative effects, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition. Based on 2 trials showing a reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and improvement in dyspnea after 3 hours of therapy,\n\n【134】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【135】Intravenous nesiritide, a natriuretic peptide, in the treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure.\n\n【136】synthetic BNP (nesiritide) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for clinical use.\n\n【137】A year later, the PRECEDENT (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Cardiac Ectopy With Dobutamine or Nesiritide Therapy) trial was published, which showed symptomatic improvements with nesiritide compared with dobutamine, with lower rates of ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n【138】Effect of nesiritide (b-type natriuretic peptide) and dobutamine on ventricular arrhythmias in the treatment of patients with acutely decompensated congestive heart failure: the PRECEDENT study.\n\n【139】By 2004, nesiritide was in widespread use in various off-label clinical settings despite the lack of documented clinical benefits. These settings included prolonged infusions in patients awaiting heart transplants, 1-time doses given as first-line therapy for ADHF in the emergency department, and intermittent, scheduled injections in outpatient infusion clinics in patients with chronic HF.\n\n【140】However, 2 meta-analyses published in 2005 noted increased renal failure, hypotension, and mortality rates in patients treated with nesiritide, prompting further studies.\n\n【141】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【142】The first subsequent randomized study, the FUSION II (Second Follow-up Serial Infusions of Nesiritide) trial, showed no clinical benefits with serial outpatient nesiritide infusions.\n\n【143】Safety and efficacy of outpatient nesiritide in patients with advanced heart failure: results of the Second Follow-Up Serial Infusions of Nesiritide (FUSION II) trial.\n\n【144】Then, 2 large-scale trials evaluated inpatient nesiritide therapy. The first, the ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure) trial, randomized 7141 patients to receive nesiritide (0.01 μg/kg per minute for at least 24 hours and up to 7 days) or placebo therapy.\n\n【145】effect of nesiritide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【146】There were no significant improvements in self-reported dyspnea rates at 6 and 24 hours and no differences in death or HF hospitalization rates.\n\n【147】Effects of nesiritide and predictors of urine output in acute decompensated heart failure: results from ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure).\n\n【148】However, nesiritide use led to more adverse events, especially hypotension (26.6% vs 15.3%; _P_ ≤.001). The second trial, the previously mentioned ROSE-AHF study,\n\n【149】Targeting the kidney in acute heart failure: can old drugs provide new benefit? Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (ROSE AHF) trial.\n\n【150】specifically targeted patients with ADHF and renal failure. Compared with placebo use, low-dose (0.005 μg/kg per minute) nesiritide therapy was not associated with improvements in urine output, renal function, symptoms, mortality rates, or rehospitalization rates. In addition, nesiritide therapy led to higher symptomatic hypotension rates.\n\n【151】Although there may remain a yet-undiscovered niche use, the ASCEND-HF and ROSE-AHF trials indicate no current role for nesiritide in augmenting urine output or renal function in patients with ADHF. Nesiritide should be used only after proven treatment strategies have not improved symptoms (and then only in select inpatients who are not hypotensive or in cardiogenic shock), and expectations for therapeutic success should be tempered by knowledge of these recent negative clinical studies. Table 3 summarizes the pharmacologic properties of nesiritide and the relevant clinical trials.\n\n【152】Table 3 Summary of Mechanisms of Action and Recent Evidence for Dopamine and Nesiritide in ADHF\n\n| Therapy | Mechanisms of action | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【154】ADHF = acute decompensated heart failure; PCWP = pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; RAAS = renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\n【155】### Ultrafiltration\n\n【156】Although first considered in 1908, venovenous ultrafiltration (UF) was not used in the HF population until low-impact devices were developed. Modern UF machines typically use 2 peripheral venous catheters, thus avoiding the complications of large-bore central venous access.\n\n【157】These catheters are attached to a machine with 2 pumps and a blood filter circuit. Within a minute, blood rapidly circulates through a special filter, sheds excess water and salt through aquapheresis, and then returns back to the patient. By design, UF machines are relatively easy to use, do not require intensive care unit or dialysis center monitoring, and have limited settings focused on adjusting the rate of isotonic fluid removal (which is usually restricted to a maximum of 0.5 L/h). Ultrafiltration is very effective at removing fluid, averaging 4.7 L for a single session, 7.1 L in 2 sessions, and 8.6 L during a hospitalization.\n\n【158】Ultrafiltration versus usual care for hospitalized patients with heart failure: the Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (RAPID-CHF) trial.\n\n【159】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【160】Outcomes of volume-overloaded cardiovascular patients treated with ultrafiltration.\n\n【161】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【162】Early on, several smaller studies suggested a promising future for UF.\n\n【163】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【164】Isolated ultrafiltration in moderate congestive heart failure.\n\n【165】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【166】Sustained improvement in functional capacity after removal of body fluid with isolated ultrafiltration in chronic cardiac insufficiency: failure of furosemide to provide the same result.\n\n【167】By 2005, larger trials emerged, which are summarized in Table 4 . The first study was the RAPID-CHF (Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure) trial, which randomized 40 patients with concomitant renal insufficiency to receive a single 8-hour UF session or usual care.\n\n【168】Ultrafiltration versus usual care for hospitalized patients with heart failure: the Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (RAPID-CHF) trial.\n\n【169】The UF group lost more volume (4.7 L vs 2.8 L; _P_ \\=.001) and had less dyspnea. Adding a second UF session was even more effective, with continued higher volume removal at 48 hours (8.4 L vs 5.4 L; _P_ \\=.012). Subsequently, the 200-patient UNLOAD (Ultrafiltration vs IV Diuretics for Patients Hospitalized for Acute Decompensated CHF) trial demonstrated similar results, with the UF group having greater mean ± SD weight loss (5.0±3.1 kg vs 3.1±3.5 kg; _P_ \\=.001) and water removal (4.6 L vs 3.3 L; _P_ \\=.001) at 48 hours but with no differences in dyspnea.\n\n【170】UNLOAD Trial Investigators  \nUltrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【171】By 90 days, the UF group had a mean ± SD lower risk of HF rehospitalization (0.22±0.54 vs 0.46±0.76; _P_ \\=.022) and fewer unscheduled clinic visits (21% vs 44%; _P_ \\=.009). There were no differences in renal function or mortality rates.\n\n【172】A randomized, controlled trial of the renal effects of ultrafiltration as compared to furosemide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【173】Table 4 Summary of Mechanisms of Action and Recent Evidence for UF in ADHF\n\n| Mechanisms of action | Evidence |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【175】ADHF = acute decompensated heart failure; UF = ultrafiltration.\n\n【176】Despite these promising results, the trials were criticized because the usual care groups were not aggressively treated with diuretics as most received only double their outpatient diuretic regimen. For the subset treated more aggressively, diuretic therapy was similar to UF in reducing fluid (−4.6 L vs −3.9 L) and weight (5.0 kg vs 3.6 kg).\n\n【177】UNLOAD Trial Investigators  \nUltrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【178】In response, the CARRESS-HF (Cardiorenal Rescue Study in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) trial was then performed, which randomized 188 patients with ADHF, worsened renal function (creatinine level ≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline), and persistent intravascular congestion to receive UF or diuretic therapy.\n\n【179】Ultrafiltration in decompensated heart failure with cardiorenal syndrome.\n\n【180】In contrast to previous trials, usual care patients were initially treated with high-dose loop diuretics and then received additional thiazide diuretics, inotropes, or vasodilators if urine output was inadequate. As a result, there were no differences in mean ± SD weight loss at 96 hours (5.5±5.1 kg vs 5.7±3.9 kg; _P_ \\=.58), but the UF group had more serious adverse events (72% vs 57%; _P_ \\=.03), mainly due to bleeding and catheter-related complications, and worsened mean ± SD serum creatinine levels (0.23±0.7 mg/dL vs −0.04±0.53 mg/dL; _P_ \\=.003). Aside from the use of more intensive medical therapy, the enrollment of only patients with evidence of worsened renal function (cardiorenal syndrome) in CARRESS-HF may explain the disparate results between it and the UNLOAD studies.\n\n【181】In conclusion, UF is effective in removing fluid in patients with ADHF but is associated with increased risks, mainly due to vascular access complications (vein access, bleeding, trauma, and infection). Based on the current evidence, UF is similarly efficacious to optimally dosed diuretic therapy, costs more, and requires close patient supervision. Therefore, UF should not be initially considered, although it may prove useful in diuretic-refractory patients with ADHF. Because equipoise exists regarding appropriate use of UF in ADHF, a larger, 800-patient, randomized controlled trial was undertaken, but it was terminated due to patient recruitment challenges.\n\n【182】Preventive Strategies\n---------------------\n\n【183】### Fluid and Salt Restriction\n\n【184】Neurohormonal imbalances created by HF lead to an inability to excrete sodium and water. Therefore, conventional wisdom has advised limiting the intake of both because one cannot accumulate what one does not ingest. Early studies suggested that patients with HF on high-salt diets have an inability to augment ventricular contractility, plasma natriuretic factors, and urine sodium excretion.\n\n【185】Abnormalities of sodium handling and of cardiovascular adaptations during high salt diet in patients with mild heart failure.\n\n【186】However, these responses seem to be different in patients treated with typical modern pharmacologic therapies (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists). In fact, 1 study showed that these patients have similar responses to controls when exposed to high salt loads, augmenting the cardiac index and stroke volume while decreasing peripheral vascular resistance and suppressing angiotensin II and norepinephrine levels. Moreover, continued high-salt diet exposure did not lead to ADHF.\n\n【187】Hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses to changes in sodium intake in compensated heart failure.\n\n【188】In contrast, sodium restriction led to no change in NYHA classifications but increases in aldosterone, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels.\n\n【189】Regarding clinically relevant outcomes, recent studies also contradict commonly held beliefs correlating increases in sodium intake (and, therefore, total body fluid retention and increased weight) with ADHF. In 1 study, patients presenting to the emergency department with HF did not consume more high-sodium food in the preceding 3 days.\n\n【190】In another study, most patients (∼54%) did not have a significant change in weight before developing ADHF.\n\n【191】In yet another study, which collected data from implantable hemodynamic monitoring systems in patients with HF, weight gain did not precede ADHF; instead, most had increased intracardiac filling pressures first.\n\n【192】Transition from chronic compensated to acute decompensated heart failure: pathophysiological insights obtained from continuous monitoring of intracardiac pressures.\n\n【193】Intriguingly, 2 randomized controlled trials evaluating different sodium intake diets also suggested no benefit to sodium restriction. In the first trial, recently admitted patients randomized to the less-restricted diet (2.8 g) had fewer readmissions at 180 days (8% vs 26%) and lower plasma renin, aldosterone, and BNP levels compared with patients randomized to the more sodium-restricted diet (1.8 g/d).\n\n【194】However, this trial required unusually high doses of furosemide (250-500 mg twice daily) and unrealistically limited fluid intake to 1000 mL/d. A subsequent trial by the same group randomized patients to receive 1.8 g vs 2.8 g of sodium per day and 1 L vs 2 L of fluid per day and used lower doses of furosemide (125-250 mg twice daily). Again, higher sodium intake was associated with decreased readmissions at 180 days (adjusted odds ratio of 2.46) and improved neurohormonal markers.\n\n【195】Medium term effects of different dosage of diuretic, sodium, and fluid administration on neurohormonal and clinical outcome in patients with recently compensated heart failure.\n\n【196】In contrast to the previously mentioned trials, a recent cohort study evaluated sodium intake over 6 days in 123 patients with systolic HF and found that patients in the highest tertile of sodium consumption had a higher risk of mortality and all-cause hospitalizations (combined adjusted hazard ratio of 2.55 vs the lowest tertile).\n\n【197】A high-sodium diet is associated with acute decompensated heart failure in ambulatory heart failure patients: a prospective follow-up study.\n\n【198】These patients also had higher total daily fluid intake (2.4 L vs 2 L).\n\n【199】In the inpatient setting, sodium restriction also may not be beneficial. One study randomized 75 patients with ADHF to a fluid- or sodium-restricted diet (800 mL/d or 800 mg/d, respectively) or an unrestricted diet for 3 days.\n\n【200】There were no differences in dosages of loop diuretics and no differences in length of stay, renal function, clinical congestion, body weight, or readmission rates. However, perceived thirst was significantly worse in the sodium- and fluid-restricted groups.\n\n【201】Finally, a research team evaluated combining high-dose furosemide with high-dose hypertonic saline (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% saline) in patients with diuretic-refractory ADHF, randomizing 107 patients to receive this unique therapy vs high-dose furosemide (500-1000 mg/d) therapy alone. The group receiving hypertonic saline had improved diuresis, natriuresis, and renal function, with lower readmission (47% vs 79%) and mortality (45% vs 87%) rates during the 48-month follow-up period.\n\n【202】Effects of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution infusion in comparison with a high dose of furosemide as bolus in refractory congestive heart failure: long-term effects.\n\n【203】Of note, the patients in both groups received far higher doses of intravenous furosemide (500-1000 mg/d) than is usual; thus, this trial needs to be replicated with standard diuretic treatments before endorsing hypertonic saline therapy.\n\n【204】Previously, the American Heart Association, the European Society of Cardiology, and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society had recommended sodium and water restriction in patients with HF. However, given the previously noted data and a recent Cochrane Review citing the potential for increased harm,\n\n【205】the most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines do not endorse any specific level of sodium or fluid intake in patients with stage C and D HF.\n\n【206】2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.\n\n【207】Because this is controversial,\n\n【208】well-conducted large-scale trials are needed to definitively determine the role of sodium and water in patients with HF.\n\n【209】### Monitoring Strategies\n\n【210】There is a strong interest in the early detection of ADHF because early treatment can prevent morbidity and hospitalizations.\n\n【211】Therefore, considerable research has focused on invasive and noninvasive early-warning monitoring methods.\n\n【212】#### Noninvasive Strategies\n\n【213】Telemonitoring allows for remote monitoring of weights and symptoms, ideally prompting rapid therapeutic changes in the outpatient setting. One of the earliest large randomized controlled trials to show benefit enrolled 280 outpatients with NYHA class III and IV symptoms. Clinicians were required to review proprietary home monitoring system data daily and adjust medications accordingly. Telemonitoring led to unexpectedly lower mortality rates (absolute risk reduction = 10.3%; _P_ \\=.003), although there were no differences in 6-month hospitalization rates, the primary end point.\n\n【214】Randomized trial of a daily electronic home monitoring system in patients with advanced heart failure: the Weight Monitoring in Heart Failure (WHARF) trial.\n\n【215】Subsequent well-conducted trials have not shown benefits in morbidity or mortality rates. The Tele-HF (Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes) trial used a different telemonitoring system that required patients to report daily symptoms and weights. These data were reviewed by clinicians who adjusted patients’ HF medications. Because this required considerable effort (reviewing >3 data reports per week), adherence was only 55% in the telemonitoring group, likely explaining the lack of differences in 6-month readmission or death rates.\n\n【216】Telemonitoring in patients with heart failure.\n\n【217】Another trial, the TIM-HF (Telemedical Interventional Monitoring in Heart Failure) trial, prospectively evaluated telemedical management in 710 patients with NYHA class II and III HF. Despite using a more sophisticated system, which automatically transmitted 3-lead electrocardiographic data, blood pressure, and daily weights, there were no differences in mortality or HF hospitalization rates.\n\n【218】Impact of remote telemedical management on mortality and hospitalizations in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure: the telemedical interventional monitoring in heart failure study.\n\n【219】Given the limited value of telemonitoring, manufacturers have developed alternative monitoring devices. One noninvasive device uses multiple sensors to detect changes in thoracic electrical impedance and then performs impedance cardiography (ICG) to estimate aortic blood flow and other hemodynamic parameters.\n\n【220】In the PREDICT (Prospective Evaluation of Cardiac Decompensation in Patients With Heart Failure by Impedance Cardiography Test) trial, 212 patients with HF underwent biweekly clinical assessments and ICG measurements for 26 weeks. Researchers synthesized the ICG data to develop a composite score highly predictive of clinical events in the ensuing 14 days.\n\n【221】Utility of impedance cardiography for the identification of short-term risk of clinical decompensation in stable patients with chronic heart failure.\n\n【222】Now, ICG is being further evaluated in the PREVENT-HF (Prevention of Heart Failure Events With Impedance Cardiography Testing) trial, which will determine whether ICG analysis can help prevent hospitalizations.\n\n【223】Another strategy uses the VeriCor left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) monitor (VeriCor Medical Systems), which noninvasively measures radial artery blood pressure and lung pressures during the Valsalva maneuver to estimate LVEDP.\n\n【224】Evaluation of a noninvasive system for determining left ventricular filling pressure.\n\n【225】In a recent trial, 25 hospitalized patients were randomized to treatment guided by VeriCor monitor–estimated LVEDP levels, and another 25 were treated based on clinical signs alone. The intervention group had lower LVEDPs at hospital discharge (19.7 mm Hg vs 25.6 mm Hg; _P_ \\=.01) as well as decreased rehospitalization rates (16% vs 48% at 1-year follow-up).\n\n【226】Noninvasive monitoring of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure reduces rehospitalization rates in patients hospitalized for heart failure: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【227】These results are encouraging; however, a larger randomized controlled trial is needed to fully evaluate the VeriCor system before recommending widespread use.\n\n【228】#### Invasive Monitoring\n\n【229】Compared with noninvasive devices, implantable hemodynamic monitors (IHMs) have the ability to continuously monitor real-time cardiac hemodynamics. In theory, IHM can help practitioners adjust HF medications and optimize intravascular fluid status in inpatient and outpatient settings. The first IHM device, Chronicle (Medtronic Inc), was similar to a single-lead pacemaker. Essentially, a pressure-monitoring transvenous lead was positioned in the right ventricular outflow tract that then transmitted data to a subcutaneously placed device. While promising, the COMPASS-HF (Chronicle Offers Management to Patients With Advanced Signs and Symptoms of Heart Failure) trial showed no advantage to IHM-guided therapy compared with optimal medical management.\n\n【230】Randomized controlled trial of an implantable continuous hemodynamic monitor in patients with advanced heart failure: the COMPASS-HF study.\n\n【231】A subsequent trial, REDUCEhf (Reducing Events in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure), which combined Chronicle technology with an implantable cardiac defibrillator, also showed no benefits.\n\n【232】Continuous hemodynamic monitoring in patients with mild to moderate heart failure: results of the Reducing Decompensation Events Utilizing Intracardiac Pressures in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure (REDUCEhf) trial.\n\n【233】With this combined device, there were also safety concerns because the increased complexity resulting from implanting 2 separate leads in the right ventricular led to an intolerably high risk of IHM lead failure (4% at 4 years).\n\n【234】Another means of invasive monitoring was studied in FAST (Fluid Accumulation Status Trial), a prospective, double-blind study evaluating intrathoracic impedance measurements in predicting HF events.\n\n【235】Intrathoracic impedance vs daily weight monitoring for predicting worsening heart failure events: results of the Fluid Accumulation Status Trial (FAST).\n\n【236】Patients with previously implanted cardioverter defibrillators received a software update (OptiVol; Medtronic Inc) that recorded intrathoracic impedance. The sensitivity of the software to predict HF events was superior compared with that of following changes in weight (76% vs 23%; _P_ <.001). The FAST trial prompted the DOT-HF (Diagnostic Outcome Trial in HF) trial, which randomized 335 patients with HF to receive ambulatory management based on intrathoracic impedance via OptiVol or usual care.\n\n【237】Intrathoracic impedance monitoring, audible patient alerts, and outcome in patients with heart failure.\n\n【238】No clinical benefits were observed with OptiVol-guided therapy; in fact, there were increased ambulatory visits and HF hospitalizations. Of note, this trial was terminated early owing to slow enrollment, with only 355 patients enrolled in a planned 2400-patient study.\n\n【239】In contrast to the previously mentioned IHM devices, the CardioMEMS device (St Jude Medical) is associated with clinical improvements. This device is implanted in the pulmonary artery and measures pressure waveforms in the distal pulmonary artery. In the CHAMPION-HF (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Class III Heart Failure Subjects) trial, the device was implanted in 550 patients with NYHA class III HF, who were then randomized to a treatment group, which allowed clinicians to use device data for management, or a control group.\n\n【240】Wireless pulmonary artery haemodynamic monitoring in chronic heart failure: a randomised controlled trial.\n\n【241】删除21:<u>CardioMEMS monitoring led to a 28% reduction in HF-related hospitalizations at 6 months and a 37% reduction during follow-up. The intervention group had shorter hospital stays (2.2 days vs 3.8 days) and an improved quality of life. Most importantly, the device was safe, without significant adverse events. Despite controversy about whether this trial adequately blinded CardioMEMS output in the control group, the FDA approved CardioMEMS in 2014.</u>\n\n【242】Although CardioMEMS is the only FDA-approved device, several other IHMs are currently under development. Two notable IHMs are HeartPod (St Jude Medical) and a system developed by Remon Medical Technologies. In brief, HeartPod monitors left atrial pressures and is currently being evaluated in a large randomized controlled trial.\n\n【243】In a pilot trial, 40 patients with NYHA class III or IV HF had an average reduction in left atrial pressures from 17.6 mm Hg in the first 3 months to 14.8 mm Hg; however, the study was underpowered to detect clinical differences.\n\n【244】Physician-directed patient self-management of left atrial pressure in advanced chronic heart failure.\n\n【245】The other device (Remon Medical Technologies) has shown promise in a pilot trial and is currently being evaluated in the PAPIRUS III (Monitoring Pulmonary Artery Pressure by Implantable Device Responding to Ultrasonic Signal) trial.\n\n【246】All in all, IHM devices have a promising future, and we believe that their role in managing HF will continue to evolve as more devices are studied and come to market. Table 5 summarizes the data available for the various preventive strategies.\n\n【247】Table 5 Summary of Preventive Strategies and Recent Evidence\n\n| Intervention | Evidence | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【249】ACC = American College of Cardiology; AHA = American Heart Association; FDA = Food and Drug Administration; HF = heart failure; ICD = implantable cardioverter defibrillator; ICG = impedence cardiography; IHM = implantable hemodynamic monitor; LVEDP = left ventricular end diastolic pressure; NYHA = New York Heart Association; RCT = randomized controlled trial; RV = right ventricular.\n\n【250】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【251】Volume overload remains a vexing clinical problem. Previously, clinicians relied on physiologic and pharmacologic principles to guide them in treating and preventing volume overload in these patients. However, as this review illustrates, high-quality clinical trials have provided evidence to guide clinicians in the day-to-day treatment of patients with ADHF. Intriguing small studies have hinted that perhaps not all loop diuretics are created equal and call for larger rigorous clinical trials. Large, well-conducted clinical trials evaluating nesiritide and dopamine suggest that neither drug has a major role in ADHF management. Ultrafiltration remains a promising modality for fluid removal for diuretic-refractory patients, but clinical studies do not suggest benefit for most patients compared with optimal diuretic therapy. The age-old principle of sodium restriction has been called into question by observational and clinical studies, and further prospective investigation is required. Finally, we are at the dawn of the era of invasive hemodynamic monitoring for HF management. However, as we evaluate this exciting new technology, we must remember that it is our duty to ensure that it meets the same standard we require of all other therapies: sound clinical evidence suggesting benefit in treating or preventing volume overload in patients with HF.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【4】Article Highlights", "content": "【0】Volume Overload in Heart Failure\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】Acute decompensated heart failure is the leading cause of hospital admission in the United States, with a high risk of readmission within 30 days.

As a result, neurohormonal pathways are up-regulated, including the sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and vasopressin (or antidiuretic hormone) axis. Temporarily, mean arterial pressure and cardiac output increase to levels adequate for tissue perfusion; however, chronic neurohormonal activation is eventually deleterious, leading to salt and water retention and subsequent worsening of cardiac output.\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】Ultimately, excessive activation manifests with the familiar signs and symptoms of volume overload—the leading cause of ADHF hospitalizations.\n\n【26】In this review, we focus on treatments to remove excess fluid and prevent its accumulation in patients with HF, emphasizing recent clinical trials. All the references cited in this review have been obtained through PubMed using the following key words: _heart failure and volume overload, congestion, loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, dopamine, cardiorenal syndrome, nesiritide, vasopressin antagonists, ultrafiltration, sodium restriction, fluid restriction, telemonitoring_ , and _invasive hemodynamic monitoring_ . We also reviewed relevant references cited in the obtained articles, especially articles addressing methods of treating or preventing volume overload in patients with HF.\n\n【27】Strategies for Fluid Removal\n----------------------------\n\n【28】### Diuretic Therapy\n\n【29】Diuretics are the mainstay of therapy in patients with congestive HF. Loop diuretics, which inhibit the Na-K-2Cl transport symporter, leading to decreased sodium absorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle, are most commonly used. If loop diuretics are not sufficient, additional synergistic diuretics that affect either the NaCl cotransporter (thiazides) or the renal mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone antagonists) are used.\n\n【30】#### Loop Diuretics\n\n【31】Loop diuretics, which include furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, and ethacrynic acid, are all generic. In the United States, furosemide was introduced much earlier than bumetanide and torsemide and is most commonly used. As a result, 87% of inpatients with ADHF are treated with furosemide, 3% with bumetanide, 0.4% with torsemide, and 10% with a combination of synergistic diuretics.\n\n【32】Dominance of furosemide for loop diuretic therapy in heart failure: time to revisit the alternatives?\n\n【33】Comparatively, loop diuretics are structurally similar, except for ethacrynic acid, which lacks a sulfa moiety. However, it is associated with a greater risk of ototoxicity, relegating its use to patients with allergies to sulfa-containing medications.\n\n【34】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【35】The other loop diuretics do have important differences in their pharmacokinetics . For furosemide, the bioavailability ranges from 10% to 90%, with absorption decreasing in patients with severe ADHF-associated gut edema.\n\n【36】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【37】In contrast, bumetanide and torsemide are less affected by intestinal wall edema, allowing for higher and more predictable bioavailability ranging from 80% to 100%.\n\n【38】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【39】Once in the blood, concentration kinetics also differ; furosemide and bumetanide have half-lives of 1 to 3 hours and a 6- to 8-hour duration of action, and torsemide has a longer half-life at 4 to 6 hours, with a 12- to 18-hour duration of action.\n\n【40】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【41】Table 1 Loop Diuretic Comparison\n\n【42】<sup>a</sup>\n\n| Characteristic | Furosemide | Bumetanide | Torsemide |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FDA approval year | 1966 | 1983 | 1993 |\n\n| Typical oral doses | 40-160 mg 1-2 times per dayMaximum: 600 mg/d | 0.5-4 mg 1-2 times per dayMaximum: 10 mg/d | 20-80 mg/dMaximum: 200 mg/d |\n\n【45】a FDA = Food and Drug Administration.\n\n【46】Compared with other loop diuretics, torsemide intrinsically blocks sympathetic nervous system and aldosterone activity, which may lead to favorable cardiac remodeling and decreased kaliuresis.\n\n【47】Effects of torasemide on cardiac sympathetic nerve activity and left ventricular remodelling in patients with congestive heart failure.\n\n【48】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【49】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【50】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【51】Torasemide versus furosemide in patients with congestive heart failure: a double-masked, randomized study.\n\n【52】In an open-label, randomized controlled trial, patients treated with torsemide were found to have decreased myocardial fibrosis on 8-month endomyocardial biopsy specimens.\n\n【53】Although intriguing, only a few clinical outcome studies have subsequently compared torsemide with other loop diuretics. In an open-label trial, 234 hospitalized patients with ADHF were randomized to receive either furosemide or torsemide and continued the same diuretic treatment for 1 year. Despite being a sicker group (ie, more previous admissions for ADHF), the torsemide group had lower ADHF readmission rates (17% vs 32%) and spent fewer days in the hospital (106 vs 296 total days). In addition, the torsemide group had less fatigue but had no change in dyspnea.\n\n【54】Open-label randomized trial of torsemide compared with furosemide therapy for patients with heart failure.\n\n【55】In the outpatient setting, torsemide was examined in the TORIC (Torasemide in Congestive Heart Failure) study, a nonrandomized, open-label, postmarketing, 1-year surveillance trial of 1377 patients that noted decreased overall mortality rates with torsemide use (2.2%) compared with other loop diuretic use (4.5%).\n\n【56】Forty-six percent of torsemide-treated patients also had improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class compared with 37.2% with other diuretic treatments. Finally, adverse electrolyte changes were less, with 3% of the torsemide group requiring potassium supplementation compared with 30% with other diuretics. Because this was a retrospective, nonrandomized study, a prospective, randomized, unblinded study was subsequently performed in 237 outpatients. Compared with furosemide, torsemide improved symptoms (40.2% vs 30.7% improved NYHA class); however, there were no differences in hospitalization or mortality rates.\n\n【57】In addition to the 4 “classic” loop diuretics, there is another, azosemide, with a longer duration of action. Theoretically, azosemide leads to decreased “rebound” activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system compared with shorter-acting diuretics. Clinically, 1 trial showed benefit in 320 patients with HF who were randomized to receive 2 years of treatment with 30 to 60 mg of azosemide vs 20 to 40 mg of daily furosemide, resulting in decreased HF hospitalization rates (hazard ratio, 0.53; _P_ \\=.04), with no change in overall mortality rates.\n\n【58】Superiority of long-acting to short-acting loop diuretics in the treatment of congestive heart failure.\n\n【59】This drug needs more study and is not currently available in the United States.\n\n【60】There remains a paucity of high-quality, double-blind, randomized controlled trial data despite the widespread use of loop diuretics. Comparative trials are urgently needed, especially for furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, and azosemide. In the meantime, we suggest that the available evidence favors torsemide use.\n\n【61】With any loop diuretic, clinicians treating inpatients with ADHF must also decide on a method for intravenous administration—either continuous infusion or intermittent boluses. Compared with intermittent boluses, continuous delivery theoretically leads to lower peak concentrations, less renal dysfunction and neurohormonal activation, and decreased “rebound” sodium and water retention. However, few studies compared the 2 methods until the DOSE (Diuretic Strategies in Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) trial was published in 2011. This trial was a prospective, double-blind trial randomizing 300 patients to receive either continuous vs bolus furosemide therapy and high- vs low-dose furosemide strategies.\n\n【62】Diuretic strategies in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【63】There were no differences in symptoms, creatinine levels, cystatin C levels, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels, likelihood of a switch to oral diuretics at 48 hours, or hospital length of stay in the continuous and bolus arms. At 72 hours, patients treated with the high-dose strategy had more fluid loss (4899 mL vs 3575 mL; _P_ \\=.001) and weight loss, improved dyspnea scores ( _P_ \\=.04), and a trend toward greater reduction in NT-pro-BNP levels (−1822 pg/mL vs −1194 pg/mL; _P_ \\=.06). However, there were no differences in hospital length of stay, mortality, or 60-day readmission rates, and a greater proportion had an increase in creatinine concentration by more than 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4) (23% vs 14%; _P_ \\=.04). Given the overall results of this well-conducted trial, there is no added benefit to routine continuous intravenous infusions over bolus administration of loop diuretics in the treatment of ADHF.\n\n【64】#### Thiazide Diuretics\n\n【65】Thiazide diuretics are typically used for hypertension treatment,\n\n【66】2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8).\n\n【67】but they also can modestly affect volume removal. When added to a loop diuretic, the combination potentiates diuresis due to sequential receptor blockade in the ascending loop of Henle and the distal nephron.\n\n【68】Thiazides are especially useful in patients with long-term loop diuretic use because they help overcome the decreased loop diuretic response caused by hypertrophy of the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule.\n\n【69】Despite these well-known observations, studies supporting combination therapy include few patients and do not compare different therapy combinations.\n\n【70】Oral metolazone plus furosemide for home therapy in patients with refractory heart failure.\n\n【71】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【72】Clinically, combination therapy can cause profound electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia, which requires close monitoring in the inpatient and outpatient settings.\n\n【73】Although there are no comparative data among the thiazide diuretics, metolazone and chlorothiazide tend to be favored, although hydrocholorothiazide and chlorthalidone can also be considered. We recommend metolazone, which should be administered infrequently (ie, 2.5-5 mg every 48 hours) owing to its long half-life. For patients who cannot take oral medications, we favor chlorothiazide (250-500 mg twice daily), which is available in a more expensive intravenous formulation.\n\n【74】#### Aldosterone Antagonists\n\n【75】Table 2 summarizes the data for spironolactone, a nonselective mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, and eplerenone, a newer medication with minimal effects on sex steroid receptors.\n\n【76】Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction.\n\n【77】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【78】The effect of spironolactone on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure: Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study Investigators.\n\n【79】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【80】Eplerenone in patients with systolic heart failure and mild symptoms.\n\n【81】In select patients, low-dose therapy decreases morbidity and mortality when added to standard HF medications owing to cardiac antifibrotic effects and beneficial cardiac remodeling.\n\n【82】Randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of aldosterone antagonism with eplerenone on ventricular remodeling in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.\n\n【83】Furthermore, higher-dose therapy leads to diuresis by blocking renal salt-retaining aldosterone receptors.\n\n【84】In contrast to low-dose therapy, high-dose therapy was evaluated in only 1 trial, which enrolled 100 patients with ADHF to receive either placebo or 50 to 100 mg of spironolactone. By the third day, treatment was associated with decreased edema, orthopnea, and NT-pro-BNP levels (2488 pg/mL vs 1555 pg/mL).\n\n【85】However, there were no differences in length of stay, and renal function worsened (20% in the spironolactone group had a ≥0.3 mg/dL rise in serum creatinine concentration compared with 4%), with no differences in serum potassium levels. Despite being the largest trial of its kind, this was a small study conducted at a single center in Portugal; the assessing physicians were not blinded to the treatment, and patient assignments were not randomized. Therefore, these results call for a definitive, larger, randomized controlled trial.\n\n【86】Table 2 Aldosterone Antagonist Comparison\n\n【87】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【88】AMI = acute myocardial infarction; CHF = congestive heart failure; EF = ejection fraction; HR = hazard ratio; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SCD = sudden cardiac death.\n\n【89】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【90】SI conversion factor: To convert creatinine values to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4.\n\n| Characteristic | Spironolactone | Eplerenone | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n【92】a AMI = acute myocardial infarction; CHF = congestive heart failure; EF = ejection fraction; HR = hazard ratio; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SCD = sudden cardiac death.\n\n【93】b SI conversion factor: To convert creatinine values to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4.\n\n【94】c Caution: estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> or potassium levels of 5.0 mmol/L or greater.\n\n【95】#### Vasopressin Antagonists\n\n【96】Solute-free water diuretics, or aquaretics, work via vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) antagonism and include lixivaptan, tolvaptan, and conivaptan. Although they are mostly used to correct hyponatremia, they have also been evaluated for ADHF treatment owing to their diuretic properties. For tolvaptan, it was first clinically evaluated in the ACTIV in CHF (Acute and Chronic Therapeutic Impact of a Vasopressin Antagonist in Congestive Heart Failure) study, in which 319 hospitalized patients with persistent congestive ADHF were randomized to receive tolvaptan (either 30, 60, or 90 mg/d) or placebo in addition to standard HF therapy. In the first 24 hours, there was a trend toward greater weight loss in the tolvaptan groups ( _P_ <.08 for all groups vs placebo) and increased serum sodium levels, with no adverse changes in potassium levels or renal function.\n\n【97】Improvement in hyponatremia during hospitalization for worsening heart failure is associated with improved outcomes: insights from the Acute and Chronic Therapeutic Impact of a Vasopressin Antagonist in Chronic Heart Failure (ACTIV in CHF) trial.\n\n【98】Subsequently, the much larger, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4133-patient EVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan) trial revealed a benefit with tolvaptan therapy, leading to significant weight reduction and improved dyspnea scores in the first 24 hours, as well as decreasing edema by day 7.\n\n【99】Clinical course of patients with hyponatremia and decompensated systolic heart failure and the effect of vasopressin receptor antagonism with tolvaptan.\n\n【100】Despite the short-term benefits, there were no long-term differences in all-cause mortality or hospitalizations at median follow-up of almost 10 months.\n\n【101】Similar to tolvaptan, lixivaptan has shown potential benefit in diuresis. In 1 study, 42 patients with mild-to-moderate HF were randomized to receive either placebo or 1 of 6 different doses of lixivaptan. There were significant and dose-related increases in urine volume at 24 hours, with the highest lixivaptan dose (400 mg) yielding an average of 3.9 L of urine output compared with 1.8 L with placebo ( _P_ <.01).\n\n【102】Because there are no large-scale trials, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved lixivaptan and is awaiting data from the BALANCE (Treatment of Hyponatremia Based on Lixivaptan in NYHA Class III/IV Cardiac Patient Evaluation) trial, which aims to enroll 650 patients with ADHF and a serum sodium level less than 135 mEq/L (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0).\n\n【103】Rationale and design of the treatment of hyponatremia based on lixivaptan in NYHA class III/IV cardiac patient evaluation (THE BALANCE) study.\n\n【104】Compared with other “vaptans,” conivaptan is unique because it is administered intravenously. Although there are no large studies, conivaptan can improve diuresis when added to loop diuretics. A pilot study in 170 hospitalized patients with worsening ADHF were randomized to receive conivaptan (loading dose plus 2 successive infusions of 40, 80, or 120 mg/d) or placebo in addition to standard loop diuretic therapy. At each dose range, initial urine output was significantly increased at 24 and 48 hours.\n\n【105】However, many patients had infusion-site phlebitis (17.5%-33%, depending on the dose), but there were no other adverse effects, such as changes in vital signs, electrolyte levels, or cardiac rhythms.\n\n【106】In summary, although vaptans may help in the short-term in patients with ADHF and hyponatremia, current studies suggest that they do not decrease mortality rates or have long-term benefits. If used, patients require close monitoring because antidiuretic hormone antagonists can lead to rapid increases in sodium levels.\n\n【107】### Dopamine\n\n【108】Intravenous dopamine induces natriuresis and diuresis by increasing renal vasodilatation and blood flow through activation of renal-specific dopamine (DA) DA <sub>1 </sub> and DA <sub>2 </sub> receptors\n\n【109】Dopamine-1 and dopamine-2 mechanisms in the control of renal function.\n\n【110】and inhibition of proximal tubular Na <sup>+ </sup> /H <sup>+ </sup> and Na <sup>+ </sup> K <sup>+ </sup> ATPase pumps.\n\n【111】Dopamine purportedly selectively activates receptors in a dose-dependent manner, with low doses (2-5 μg/kg per minute) predominantly affecting DA <sub>1 </sub> and DA <sub>2 </sub> receptors and higher doses activating β and then α vasoreceptors.\n\n【112】Dopamine-1 and dopamine-2 mechanisms in the control of renal function.\n\n【113】This physiologic finding inspired the concept of using low-dose (“renal-dose”) dopamine to enhance diuresis in ADHF; however, this strategy has been clinically disappointing. Multiple systematic reviews have noted no meaningful benefits with low-dose dopamine therapy.\n\n【114】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【115】A 2005 meta-analysis of 61 trials encompassing 3259 patients showed no differences in mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, or adverse events. In this study, urine output increased 24% in the first 24 hours.\n\n【116】Because only 1 small study included in these reviews specifically included patients with HF,\n\n【117】3 studies were conducted evaluating low-dose dopamine for ADHF treatment. A retrospective study assessed 116 patients receiving furosemide by continuous infusion coupled with low-dose dopamine or bolus intravenous furosemide alone.\n\n【118】Continuous infusion of furosemide combined with low-dose dopamine compared to intermittent boluses in acutely decompensated heart failure is less nephrotoxic and carries a lower readmission at thirty days.\n\n【119】The patients in the dopamine/continuous furosemide arm had improved renal function, greater diuresis, fewer inpatient hospital days, and reduced 30-day readmission rates. However, the 2 groups had significantly different baseline characteristics, including worse renal function and a higher rate of aldosterone antagonist treatment in the dopamine group. The subsequent DAD-HF (Dopamine in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) study was the first to prospectively randomize patients with ADHF to receive either high-dose intravenous furosemide (20 mg/h) or low-dose intravenous furosemide (5 mg/h) coupled with 8 hours of low-dose dopamine (5 μg/kg per minute).\n\n【120】Impact of dopamine infusion on renal function in hospitalized heart failure patients: results of the Dopamine in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (DAD-HF) Trial.\n\n【121】There were no differences in diuresis, dyspnea scores, inpatient hospital days, mortality rates, renal function, or rehospitalization rates in the 60 patients enrolled in the study. Three years later, the ROSE-AHF (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure) trial supplanted DAD-HF as the largest randomized trial of low-dose dopamine in the HF population.\n\n【122】Low-dose dopamine or low-dose nesiritide in acute heart failure with renal dysfunction: the ROSE acute heart failure randomized trial.\n\n【123】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【124】Targeting the kidney in acute heart failure: can old drugs provide new benefit? Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (ROSE AHF) trial.\n\n【125】In this trial, 360 patients with ADHF and renal dysfunction were randomized to receive diuretics with placebo, low-dose dopamine (2 μg/kg per minute), or low-dose nesiritide for 72 hours. Compared with DAD-HF, ROSE-AHF used dopamine for longer (although at a lower dose), had no variations in diuretic dosing between the groups, and had a much larger study size. In the end, dopamine therapy did not affect urine output or renal function and at 60 days led to no differences in mortality or unscheduled outpatient or inpatient HF-related appointments.\n\n【126】Based on the previously mentioned trials, dopamine’s effect of renal vasodilation has not led to clinical benefits, perhaps due to variability in pharmacologic levels and heterogeneous responses to dopamine. Even in healthy individuals, a stable infusion dose of 3 μg/kg per minute of dopamine leads to unreliable dopamine plasma concentrations, varying between 1800 and 18,300 ng/L.\n\n【127】In patients with renal failure, dopamine’s renal vasodilatory effects are blunted and instead paradoxically increase renal resistance indices.\n\n【128】Similarly, patients with ADHF have reduced effects with dopamine infusion, requiring much higher–than-expected doses (4-6 μg/kg per minute) to augment peak renal blood flow and reduce renal vascular resistance. Furthermore, the sickest patients (NYHA class IV) have no dopamine-associated changes in renal vascular resistance or the fraction of cardiac output dedicated to renal perfusion.\n\n【129】Renal, but not systemic, hemodynamic effects of dopamine are influenced by the severity of congestive heart failure.\n\n【130】Therefore, dopamine’s pharmacologic effects seem least effective in patients with severe ADHF or renal failure, likely at least partly explaining the observed lack of clinical benefit.\n\n【131】As summarized in Table 3 , the routine use of dopamine for augmented diuresis or renal protection is not supported by recent studies. In patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, it is reasonable to use dopamine only transiently to increase blood pressure and cardiac output.\n\n【132】### Nesiritide\n\n【133】The effects of BNP seem perfectly tailored to therapeutic exploitation: augmented natriuresis, sympatholysis, antiproliferative effects, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition. Based on 2 trials showing a reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and improvement in dyspnea after 3 hours of therapy,\n\n【134】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【135】Intravenous nesiritide, a natriuretic peptide, in the treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure.\n\n【136】synthetic BNP (nesiritide) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for clinical use.\n\n【137】A year later, the PRECEDENT (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Cardiac Ectopy With Dobutamine or Nesiritide Therapy) trial was published, which showed symptomatic improvements with nesiritide compared with dobutamine, with lower rates of ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n【138】Effect of nesiritide (b-type natriuretic peptide) and dobutamine on ventricular arrhythmias in the treatment of patients with acutely decompensated congestive heart failure: the PRECEDENT study.\n\n【139】By 2004, nesiritide was in widespread use in various off-label clinical settings despite the lack of documented clinical benefits. These settings included prolonged infusions in patients awaiting heart transplants, 1-time doses given as first-line therapy for ADHF in the emergency department, and intermittent, scheduled injections in outpatient infusion clinics in patients with chronic HF.\n\n【140】However, 2 meta-analyses published in 2005 noted increased renal failure, hypotension, and mortality rates in patients treated with nesiritide, prompting further studies.\n\n【141】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【142】The first subsequent randomized study, the FUSION II (Second Follow-up Serial Infusions of Nesiritide) trial, showed no clinical benefits with serial outpatient nesiritide infusions.\n\n【143】Safety and efficacy of outpatient nesiritide in patients with advanced heart failure: results of the Second Follow-Up Serial Infusions of Nesiritide (FUSION II) trial.\n\n【144】Then, 2 large-scale trials evaluated inpatient nesiritide therapy. The first, the ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure) trial, randomized 7141 patients to receive nesiritide (0.01 μg/kg per minute for at least 24 hours and up to 7 days) or placebo therapy.\n\n【145】effect of nesiritide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【146】There were no significant improvements in self-reported dyspnea rates at 6 and 24 hours and no differences in death or HF hospitalization rates.\n\n【147】Effects of nesiritide and predictors of urine output in acute decompensated heart failure: results from ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure).\n\n【148】However, nesiritide use led to more adverse events, especially hypotension (26.6% vs 15.3%; _P_ ≤.001). The second trial, the previously mentioned ROSE-AHF study,\n\n【149】Targeting the kidney in acute heart failure: can old drugs provide new benefit? Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (ROSE AHF) trial.\n\n【150】specifically targeted patients with ADHF and renal failure. Compared with placebo use, low-dose (0.005 μg/kg per minute) nesiritide therapy was not associated with improvements in urine output, renal function, symptoms, mortality rates, or rehospitalization rates. In addition, nesiritide therapy led to higher symptomatic hypotension rates.\n\n【151】Although there may remain a yet-undiscovered niche use, the ASCEND-HF and ROSE-AHF trials indicate no current role for nesiritide in augmenting urine output or renal function in patients with ADHF. Nesiritide should be used only after proven treatment strategies have not improved symptoms (and then only in select inpatients who are not hypotensive or in cardiogenic shock), and expectations for therapeutic success should be tempered by knowledge of these recent negative clinical studies. Table 3 summarizes the pharmacologic properties of nesiritide and the relevant clinical trials.\n\n【152】Table 3 Summary of Mechanisms of Action and Recent Evidence for Dopamine and Nesiritide in ADHF\n\n| Therapy | Mechanisms of action | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【154】ADHF = acute decompensated heart failure; PCWP = pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; RAAS = renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\n【155】### Ultrafiltration\n\n【156】Although first considered in 1908, venovenous ultrafiltration (UF) was not used in the HF population until low-impact devices were developed. Modern UF machines typically use 2 peripheral venous catheters, thus avoiding the complications of large-bore central venous access.\n\n【157】These catheters are attached to a machine with 2 pumps and a blood filter circuit. Within a minute, blood rapidly circulates through a special filter, sheds excess water and salt through aquapheresis, and then returns back to the patient. By design, UF machines are relatively easy to use, do not require intensive care unit or dialysis center monitoring, and have limited settings focused on adjusting the rate of isotonic fluid removal (which is usually restricted to a maximum of 0.5 L/h). Ultrafiltration is very effective at removing fluid, averaging 4.7 L for a single session, 7.1 L in 2 sessions, and 8.6 L during a hospitalization.\n\n【158】Ultrafiltration versus usual care for hospitalized patients with heart failure: the Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (RAPID-CHF) trial.\n\n【159】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【160】Outcomes of volume-overloaded cardiovascular patients treated with ultrafiltration.\n\n【161】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【162】Early on, several smaller studies suggested a promising future for UF.\n\n【163】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【164】Isolated ultrafiltration in moderate congestive heart failure.\n\n【165】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【166】Sustained improvement in functional capacity after removal of body fluid with isolated ultrafiltration in chronic cardiac insufficiency: failure of furosemide to provide the same result.\n\n【167】By 2005, larger trials emerged, which are summarized in Table 4 . The first study was the RAPID-CHF (Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure) trial, which randomized 40 patients with concomitant renal insufficiency to receive a single 8-hour UF session or usual care.\n\n【168】Ultrafiltration versus usual care for hospitalized patients with heart failure: the Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (RAPID-CHF) trial.\n\n【169】The UF group lost more volume (4.7 L vs 2.8 L; _P_ \\=.001) and had less dyspnea. Adding a second UF session was even more effective, with continued higher volume removal at 48 hours (8.4 L vs 5.4 L; _P_ \\=.012). Subsequently, the 200-patient UNLOAD (Ultrafiltration vs IV Diuretics for Patients Hospitalized for Acute Decompensated CHF) trial demonstrated similar results, with the UF group having greater mean ± SD weight loss (5.0±3.1 kg vs 3.1±3.5 kg; _P_ \\=.001) and water removal (4.6 L vs 3.3 L; _P_ \\=.001) at 48 hours but with no differences in dyspnea.\n\n【170】UNLOAD Trial Investigators  \nUltrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【171】By 90 days, the UF group had a mean ± SD lower risk of HF rehospitalization (0.22±0.54 vs 0.46±0.76; _P_ \\=.022) and fewer unscheduled clinic visits (21% vs 44%; _P_ \\=.009). There were no differences in renal function or mortality rates.\n\n【172】A randomized, controlled trial of the renal effects of ultrafiltration as compared to furosemide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【173】Table 4 Summary of Mechanisms of Action and Recent Evidence for UF in ADHF\n\n| Mechanisms of action | Evidence |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【175】ADHF = acute decompensated heart failure; UF = ultrafiltration.\n\n【176】Despite these promising results, the trials were criticized because the usual care groups were not aggressively treated with diuretics as most received only double their outpatient diuretic regimen. For the subset treated more aggressively, diuretic therapy was similar to UF in reducing fluid (−4.6 L vs −3.9 L) and weight (5.0 kg vs 3.6 kg).\n\n【177】UNLOAD Trial Investigators  \nUltrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【178】In response, the CARRESS-HF (Cardiorenal Rescue Study in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) trial was then performed, which randomized 188 patients with ADHF, worsened renal function (creatinine level ≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline), and persistent intravascular congestion to receive UF or diuretic therapy.\n\n【179】Ultrafiltration in decompensated heart failure with cardiorenal syndrome.\n\n【180】In contrast to previous trials, usual care patients were initially treated with high-dose loop diuretics and then received additional thiazide diuretics, inotropes, or vasodilators if urine output was inadequate. As a result, there were no differences in mean ± SD weight loss at 96 hours (5.5±5.1 kg vs 5.7±3.9 kg; _P_ \\=.58), but the UF group had more serious adverse events (72% vs 57%; _P_ \\=.03), mainly due to bleeding and catheter-related complications, and worsened mean ± SD serum creatinine levels (0.23±0.7 mg/dL vs −0.04±0.53 mg/dL; _P_ \\=.003). Aside from the use of more intensive medical therapy, the enrollment of only patients with evidence of worsened renal function (cardiorenal syndrome) in CARRESS-HF may explain the disparate results between it and the UNLOAD studies.\n\n【181】In conclusion, UF is effective in removing fluid in patients with ADHF but is associated with increased risks, mainly due to vascular access complications (vein access, bleeding, trauma, and infection). Based on the current evidence, UF is similarly efficacious to optimally dosed diuretic therapy, costs more, and requires close patient supervision. Therefore, UF should not be initially considered, although it may prove useful in diuretic-refractory patients with ADHF. Because equipoise exists regarding appropriate use of UF in ADHF, a larger, 800-patient, randomized controlled trial was undertaken, but it was terminated due to patient recruitment challenges.\n\n【182】Preventive Strategies\n---------------------\n\n【183】### Fluid and Salt Restriction\n\n【184】Neurohormonal imbalances created by HF lead to an inability to excrete sodium and water. Therefore, conventional wisdom has advised limiting the intake of both because one cannot accumulate what one does not ingest. Early studies suggested that patients with HF on high-salt diets have an inability to augment ventricular contractility, plasma natriuretic factors, and urine sodium excretion.\n\n【185】Abnormalities of sodium handling and of cardiovascular adaptations during high salt diet in patients with mild heart failure.\n\n【186】However, these responses seem to be different in patients treated with typical modern pharmacologic therapies (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists). In fact, 1 study showed that these patients have similar responses to controls when exposed to high salt loads, augmenting the cardiac index and stroke volume while decreasing peripheral vascular resistance and suppressing angiotensin II and norepinephrine levels. Moreover, continued high-salt diet exposure did not lead to ADHF.\n\n【187】Hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses to changes in sodium intake in compensated heart failure.\n\n【188】In contrast, sodium restriction led to no change in NYHA classifications but increases in aldosterone, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels.\n\n【189】Regarding clinically relevant outcomes, recent studies also contradict commonly held beliefs correlating increases in sodium intake (and, therefore, total body fluid retention and increased weight) with ADHF. In 1 study, patients presenting to the emergency department with HF did not consume more high-sodium food in the preceding 3 days.\n\n【190】In another study, most patients (∼54%) did not have a significant change in weight before developing ADHF.\n\n【191】In yet another study, which collected data from implantable hemodynamic monitoring systems in patients with HF, weight gain did not precede ADHF; instead, most had increased intracardiac filling pressures first.\n\n【192】Transition from chronic compensated to acute decompensated heart failure: pathophysiological insights obtained from continuous monitoring of intracardiac pressures.\n\n【193】Intriguingly, 2 randomized controlled trials evaluating different sodium intake diets also suggested no benefit to sodium restriction. In the first trial, recently admitted patients randomized to the less-restricted diet (2.8 g) had fewer readmissions at 180 days (8% vs 26%) and lower plasma renin, aldosterone, and BNP levels compared with patients randomized to the more sodium-restricted diet (1.8 g/d).\n\n【194】However, this trial required unusually high doses of furosemide (250-500 mg twice daily) and unrealistically limited fluid intake to 1000 mL/d. A subsequent trial by the same group randomized patients to receive 1.8 g vs 2.8 g of sodium per day and 1 L vs 2 L of fluid per day and used lower doses of furosemide (125-250 mg twice daily). Again, higher sodium intake was associated with decreased readmissions at 180 days (adjusted odds ratio of 2.46) and improved neurohormonal markers.\n\n【195】Medium term effects of different dosage of diuretic, sodium, and fluid administration on neurohormonal and clinical outcome in patients with recently compensated heart failure.\n\n【196】In contrast to the previously mentioned trials, a recent cohort study evaluated sodium intake over 6 days in 123 patients with systolic HF and found that patients in the highest tertile of sodium consumption had a higher risk of mortality and all-cause hospitalizations (combined adjusted hazard ratio of 2.55 vs the lowest tertile).\n\n【197】A high-sodium diet is associated with acute decompensated heart failure in ambulatory heart failure patients: a prospective follow-up study.\n\n【198】These patients also had higher total daily fluid intake (2.4 L vs 2 L).\n\n【199】In the inpatient setting, sodium restriction also may not be beneficial. One study randomized 75 patients with ADHF to a fluid- or sodium-restricted diet (800 mL/d or 800 mg/d, respectively) or an unrestricted diet for 3 days.\n\n【200】There were no differences in dosages of loop diuretics and no differences in length of stay, renal function, clinical congestion, body weight, or readmission rates. However, perceived thirst was significantly worse in the sodium- and fluid-restricted groups.\n\n【201】Finally, a research team evaluated combining high-dose furosemide with high-dose hypertonic saline (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% saline) in patients with diuretic-refractory ADHF, randomizing 107 patients to receive this unique therapy vs high-dose furosemide (500-1000 mg/d) therapy alone. The group receiving hypertonic saline had improved diuresis, natriuresis, and renal function, with lower readmission (47% vs 79%) and mortality (45% vs 87%) rates during the 48-month follow-up period.\n\n【202】Effects of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution infusion in comparison with a high dose of furosemide as bolus in refractory congestive heart failure: long-term effects.\n\n【203】Of note, the patients in both groups received far higher doses of intravenous furosemide (500-1000 mg/d) than is usual; thus, this trial needs to be replicated with standard diuretic treatments before endorsing hypertonic saline therapy.\n\n【204】Previously, the American Heart Association, the European Society of Cardiology, and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society had recommended sodium and water restriction in patients with HF. However, given the previously noted data and a recent Cochrane Review citing the potential for increased harm,\n\n【205】the most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines do not endorse any specific level of sodium or fluid intake in patients with stage C and D HF.\n\n【206】2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.\n\n【207】Because this is controversial,\n\n【208】well-conducted large-scale trials are needed to definitively determine the role of sodium and water in patients with HF.\n\n【209】### Monitoring Strategies\n\n【210】There is a strong interest in the early detection of ADHF because early treatment can prevent morbidity and hospitalizations.\n\n【211】Therefore, considerable research has focused on invasive and noninvasive early-warning monitoring methods.\n\n【212】#### Noninvasive Strategies\n\n【213】Telemonitoring allows for remote monitoring of weights and symptoms, ideally prompting rapid therapeutic changes in the outpatient setting. One of the earliest large randomized controlled trials to show benefit enrolled 280 outpatients with NYHA class III and IV symptoms. Clinicians were required to review proprietary home monitoring system data daily and adjust medications accordingly. Telemonitoring led to unexpectedly lower mortality rates (absolute risk reduction = 10.3%; _P_ \\=.003), although there were no differences in 6-month hospitalization rates, the primary end point.\n\n【214】Randomized trial of a daily electronic home monitoring system in patients with advanced heart failure: the Weight Monitoring in Heart Failure (WHARF) trial.\n\n【215】Subsequent well-conducted trials have not shown benefits in morbidity or mortality rates. The Tele-HF (Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes) trial used a different telemonitoring system that required patients to report daily symptoms and weights. These data were reviewed by clinicians who adjusted patients’ HF medications. Because this required considerable effort (reviewing >3 data reports per week), adherence was only 55% in the telemonitoring group, likely explaining the lack of differences in 6-month readmission or death rates.\n\n【216】Telemonitoring in patients with heart failure.\n\n【217】Another trial, the TIM-HF (Telemedical Interventional Monitoring in Heart Failure) trial, prospectively evaluated telemedical management in 710 patients with NYHA class II and III HF. Despite using a more sophisticated system, which automatically transmitted 3-lead electrocardiographic data, blood pressure, and daily weights, there were no differences in mortality or HF hospitalization rates.\n\n【218】Impact of remote telemedical management on mortality and hospitalizations in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure: the telemedical interventional monitoring in heart failure study.\n\n【219】Given the limited value of telemonitoring, manufacturers have developed alternative monitoring devices. One noninvasive device uses multiple sensors to detect changes in thoracic electrical impedance and then performs impedance cardiography (ICG) to estimate aortic blood flow and other hemodynamic parameters.\n\n【220】In the PREDICT (Prospective Evaluation of Cardiac Decompensation in Patients With Heart Failure by Impedance Cardiography Test) trial, 212 patients with HF underwent biweekly clinical assessments and ICG measurements for 26 weeks. Researchers synthesized the ICG data to develop a composite score highly predictive of clinical events in the ensuing 14 days.\n\n【221】Utility of impedance cardiography for the identification of short-term risk of clinical decompensation in stable patients with chronic heart failure.\n\n【222】Now, ICG is being further evaluated in the PREVENT-HF (Prevention of Heart Failure Events With Impedance Cardiography Testing) trial, which will determine whether ICG analysis can help prevent hospitalizations.\n\n【223】Another strategy uses the VeriCor left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) monitor (VeriCor Medical Systems), which noninvasively measures radial artery blood pressure and lung pressures during the Valsalva maneuver to estimate LVEDP.\n\n【224】Evaluation of a noninvasive system for determining left ventricular filling pressure.\n\n【225】In a recent trial, 25 hospitalized patients were randomized to treatment guided by VeriCor monitor–estimated LVEDP levels, and another 25 were treated based on clinical signs alone. The intervention group had lower LVEDPs at hospital discharge (19.7 mm Hg vs 25.6 mm Hg; _P_ \\=.01) as well as decreased rehospitalization rates (16% vs 48% at 1-year follow-up).\n\n【226】Noninvasive monitoring of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure reduces rehospitalization rates in patients hospitalized for heart failure: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【227】These results are encouraging; however, a larger randomized controlled trial is needed to fully evaluate the VeriCor system before recommending widespread use.\n\n【228】#### Invasive Monitoring\n\n【229】Compared with noninvasive devices, implantable hemodynamic monitors (IHMs) have the ability to continuously monitor real-time cardiac hemodynamics. In theory, IHM can help practitioners adjust HF medications and optimize intravascular fluid status in inpatient and outpatient settings. The first IHM device, Chronicle (Medtronic Inc), was similar to a single-lead pacemaker. Essentially, a pressure-monitoring transvenous lead was positioned in the right ventricular outflow tract that then transmitted data to a subcutaneously placed device. While promising, the COMPASS-HF (Chronicle Offers Management to Patients With Advanced Signs and Symptoms of Heart Failure) trial showed no advantage to IHM-guided therapy compared with optimal medical management.\n\n【230】Randomized controlled trial of an implantable continuous hemodynamic monitor in patients with advanced heart failure: the COMPASS-HF study.\n\n【231】A subsequent trial, REDUCEhf (Reducing Events in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure), which combined Chronicle technology with an implantable cardiac defibrillator, also showed no benefits.\n\n【232】Continuous hemodynamic monitoring in patients with mild to moderate heart failure: results of the Reducing Decompensation Events Utilizing Intracardiac Pressures in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure (REDUCEhf) trial.\n\n【233】With this combined device, there were also safety concerns because the increased complexity resulting from implanting 2 separate leads in the right ventricular led to an intolerably high risk of IHM lead failure (4% at 4 years).\n\n【234】Another means of invasive monitoring was studied in FAST (Fluid Accumulation Status Trial), a prospective, double-blind study evaluating intrathoracic impedance measurements in predicting HF events.\n\n【235】Intrathoracic impedance vs daily weight monitoring for predicting worsening heart failure events: results of the Fluid Accumulation Status Trial (FAST).\n\n【236】Patients with previously implanted cardioverter defibrillators received a software update (OptiVol; Medtronic Inc) that recorded intrathoracic impedance. The sensitivity of the software to predict HF events was superior compared with that of following changes in weight (76% vs 23%; _P_ <.001). The FAST trial prompted the DOT-HF (Diagnostic Outcome Trial in HF) trial, which randomized 335 patients with HF to receive ambulatory management based on intrathoracic impedance via OptiVol or usual care.\n\n【237】Intrathoracic impedance monitoring, audible patient alerts, and outcome in patients with heart failure.\n\n【238】No clinical benefits were observed with OptiVol-guided therapy; in fact, there were increased ambulatory visits and HF hospitalizations. Of note, this trial was terminated early owing to slow enrollment, with only 355 patients enrolled in a planned 2400-patient study.\n\n【239】In contrast to the previously mentioned IHM devices, the CardioMEMS device (St Jude Medical) is associated with clinical improvements. This device is implanted in the pulmonary artery and measures pressure waveforms in the distal pulmonary artery. In the CHAMPION-HF (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Class III Heart Failure Subjects) trial, the device was implanted in 550 patients with NYHA class III HF, who were then randomized to a treatment group, which allowed clinicians to use device data for management, or a control group.\n\n【240】Wireless pulmonary artery haemodynamic monitoring in chronic heart failure: a randomised controlled trial.\n\n【241】删除21:<u>CardioMEMS monitoring led to a 28% reduction in HF-related hospitalizations at 6 months and a 37% reduction during follow-up.

Despite controversy about whether this trial adequately blinded CardioMEMS output in the control group, the FDA approved CardioMEMS in 2014.</u>\n\n【242】Although CardioMEMS is the only FDA-approved device, several other IHMs are currently under development. Two notable IHMs are HeartPod (St Jude Medical) and a system developed by Remon Medical Technologies. In brief, HeartPod monitors left atrial pressures and is currently being evaluated in a large randomized controlled trial.\n\n【243】In a pilot trial, 40 patients with NYHA class III or IV HF had an average reduction in left atrial pressures from 17.6 mm Hg in the first 3 months to 14.8 mm Hg; however, the study was underpowered to detect clinical differences.\n\n【244】Physician-directed patient self-management of left atrial pressure in advanced chronic heart failure.\n\n【245】The other device (Remon Medical Technologies) has shown promise in a pilot trial and is currently being evaluated in the PAPIRUS III (Monitoring Pulmonary Artery Pressure by Implantable Device Responding to Ultrasonic Signal) trial.\n\n【246】All in all, IHM devices have a promising future, and we believe that their role in managing HF will continue to evolve as more devices are studied and come to market.

Previously, clinicians relied on physiologic and pharmacologic principles to guide them in treating and preventing volume overload in these patients. However, as this review illustrates, high-quality clinical trials have provided evidence to guide clinicians in the day-to-day treatment of patients with ADHF. Intriguing small studies have hinted that perhaps not all loop diuretics are created equal and call for larger rigorous clinical trials. Large, well-conducted clinical trials evaluating nesiritide and dopamine suggest that neither drug has a major role in ADHF management. Ultrafiltration remains a promising modality for fluid removal for diuretic-refractory patients, but clinical studies do not suggest benefit for most patients compared with optimal diuretic therapy. The age-old principle of sodium restriction has been called into question by observational and clinical studies, and further prospective investigation is required. Finally, we are at the dawn of the era of invasive hemodynamic monitoring for HF management. However, as we evaluate this exciting new technology, we must remember that it is our duty to ensure that it meets the same standard we require of all other therapies: sound clinical evidence suggesting benefit in treating or preventing volume overload in patients with HF.", "index": 1908, "show": true, "start": 1908, "end": 1929, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【19】删除21:In the United States, 5.1 million Americans have heart failure (HF), and that number is expected to increase 46% by 2030.", "content": "【0】Volume Overload in Heart Failure\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】Acute decompensated heart failure is the leading cause of hospital admission in the United States, with a high risk of readmission within 30 days.

As a result, neurohormonal pathways are up-regulated, including the sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and vasopressin (or antidiuretic hormone) axis. Temporarily, mean arterial pressure and cardiac output increase to levels adequate for tissue perfusion; however, chronic neurohormonal activation is eventually deleterious, leading to salt and water retention and subsequent worsening of cardiac output.\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】Ultimately, excessive activation manifests with the familiar signs and symptoms of volume overload—the leading cause of ADHF hospitalizations.\n\n【26】In this review, we focus on treatments to remove excess fluid and prevent its accumulation in patients with HF, emphasizing recent clinical trials. All the references cited in this review have been obtained through PubMed using the following key words: _heart failure and volume overload, congestion, loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, dopamine, cardiorenal syndrome, nesiritide, vasopressin antagonists, ultrafiltration, sodium restriction, fluid restriction, telemonitoring_ , and _invasive hemodynamic monitoring_ . We also reviewed relevant references cited in the obtained articles, especially articles addressing methods of treating or preventing volume overload in patients with HF.\n\n【27】Strategies for Fluid Removal\n----------------------------\n\n【28】### Diuretic Therapy\n\n【29】Diuretics are the mainstay of therapy in patients with congestive HF. Loop diuretics, which inhibit the Na-K-2Cl transport symporter, leading to decreased sodium absorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle, are most commonly used. If loop diuretics are not sufficient, additional synergistic diuretics that affect either the NaCl cotransporter (thiazides) or the renal mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone antagonists) are used.\n\n【30】#### Loop Diuretics\n\n【31】Loop diuretics, which include furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, and ethacrynic acid, are all generic. In the United States, furosemide was introduced much earlier than bumetanide and torsemide and is most commonly used. As a result, 87% of inpatients with ADHF are treated with furosemide, 3% with bumetanide, 0.4% with torsemide, and 10% with a combination of synergistic diuretics.\n\n【32】Dominance of furosemide for loop diuretic therapy in heart failure: time to revisit the alternatives?\n\n【33】Comparatively, loop diuretics are structurally similar, except for ethacrynic acid, which lacks a sulfa moiety. However, it is associated with a greater risk of ototoxicity, relegating its use to patients with allergies to sulfa-containing medications.\n\n【34】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【35】The other loop diuretics do have important differences in their pharmacokinetics . For furosemide, the bioavailability ranges from 10% to 90%, with absorption decreasing in patients with severe ADHF-associated gut edema.\n\n【36】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【37】In contrast, bumetanide and torsemide are less affected by intestinal wall edema, allowing for higher and more predictable bioavailability ranging from 80% to 100%.\n\n【38】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【39】Once in the blood, concentration kinetics also differ; furosemide and bumetanide have half-lives of 1 to 3 hours and a 6- to 8-hour duration of action, and torsemide has a longer half-life at 4 to 6 hours, with a 12- to 18-hour duration of action.\n\n【40】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【41】Table 1 Loop Diuretic Comparison\n\n【42】<sup>a</sup>\n\n| Characteristic | Furosemide | Bumetanide | Torsemide |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FDA approval year | 1966 | 1983 | 1993 |\n\n| Typical oral doses | 40-160 mg 1-2 times per dayMaximum: 600 mg/d | 0.5-4 mg 1-2 times per dayMaximum: 10 mg/d | 20-80 mg/dMaximum: 200 mg/d |\n\n【45】a FDA = Food and Drug Administration.\n\n【46】Compared with other loop diuretics, torsemide intrinsically blocks sympathetic nervous system and aldosterone activity, which may lead to favorable cardiac remodeling and decreased kaliuresis.\n\n【47】Effects of torasemide on cardiac sympathetic nerve activity and left ventricular remodelling in patients with congestive heart failure.\n\n【48】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【49】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【50】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【51】Torasemide versus furosemide in patients with congestive heart failure: a double-masked, randomized study.\n\n【52】In an open-label, randomized controlled trial, patients treated with torsemide were found to have decreased myocardial fibrosis on 8-month endomyocardial biopsy specimens.\n\n【53】Although intriguing, only a few clinical outcome studies have subsequently compared torsemide with other loop diuretics. In an open-label trial, 234 hospitalized patients with ADHF were randomized to receive either furosemide or torsemide and continued the same diuretic treatment for 1 year. Despite being a sicker group (ie, more previous admissions for ADHF), the torsemide group had lower ADHF readmission rates (17% vs 32%) and spent fewer days in the hospital (106 vs 296 total days). In addition, the torsemide group had less fatigue but had no change in dyspnea.\n\n【54】Open-label randomized trial of torsemide compared with furosemide therapy for patients with heart failure.\n\n【55】In the outpatient setting, torsemide was examined in the TORIC (Torasemide in Congestive Heart Failure) study, a nonrandomized, open-label, postmarketing, 1-year surveillance trial of 1377 patients that noted decreased overall mortality rates with torsemide use (2.2%) compared with other loop diuretic use (4.5%).\n\n【56】Forty-six percent of torsemide-treated patients also had improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class compared with 37.2% with other diuretic treatments. Finally, adverse electrolyte changes were less, with 3% of the torsemide group requiring potassium supplementation compared with 30% with other diuretics. Because this was a retrospective, nonrandomized study, a prospective, randomized, unblinded study was subsequently performed in 237 outpatients. Compared with furosemide, torsemide improved symptoms (40.2% vs 30.7% improved NYHA class); however, there were no differences in hospitalization or mortality rates.\n\n【57】In addition to the 4 “classic” loop diuretics, there is another, azosemide, with a longer duration of action. Theoretically, azosemide leads to decreased “rebound” activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system compared with shorter-acting diuretics. Clinically, 1 trial showed benefit in 320 patients with HF who were randomized to receive 2 years of treatment with 30 to 60 mg of azosemide vs 20 to 40 mg of daily furosemide, resulting in decreased HF hospitalization rates (hazard ratio, 0.53; _P_ \\=.04), with no change in overall mortality rates.\n\n【58】Superiority of long-acting to short-acting loop diuretics in the treatment of congestive heart failure.\n\n【59】This drug needs more study and is not currently available in the United States.\n\n【60】There remains a paucity of high-quality, double-blind, randomized controlled trial data despite the widespread use of loop diuretics. Comparative trials are urgently needed, especially for furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, and azosemide. In the meantime, we suggest that the available evidence favors torsemide use.\n\n【61】With any loop diuretic, clinicians treating inpatients with ADHF must also decide on a method for intravenous administration—either continuous infusion or intermittent boluses. Compared with intermittent boluses, continuous delivery theoretically leads to lower peak concentrations, less renal dysfunction and neurohormonal activation, and decreased “rebound” sodium and water retention. However, few studies compared the 2 methods until the DOSE (Diuretic Strategies in Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) trial was published in 2011. This trial was a prospective, double-blind trial randomizing 300 patients to receive either continuous vs bolus furosemide therapy and high- vs low-dose furosemide strategies.\n\n【62】Diuretic strategies in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【63】There were no differences in symptoms, creatinine levels, cystatin C levels, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels, likelihood of a switch to oral diuretics at 48 hours, or hospital length of stay in the continuous and bolus arms. At 72 hours, patients treated with the high-dose strategy had more fluid loss (4899 mL vs 3575 mL; _P_ \\=.001) and weight loss, improved dyspnea scores ( _P_ \\=.04), and a trend toward greater reduction in NT-pro-BNP levels (−1822 pg/mL vs −1194 pg/mL; _P_ \\=.06). However, there were no differences in hospital length of stay, mortality, or 60-day readmission rates, and a greater proportion had an increase in creatinine concentration by more than 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4) (23% vs 14%; _P_ \\=.04). Given the overall results of this well-conducted trial, there is no added benefit to routine continuous intravenous infusions over bolus administration of loop diuretics in the treatment of ADHF.\n\n【64】#### Thiazide Diuretics\n\n【65】Thiazide diuretics are typically used for hypertension treatment,\n\n【66】2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8).\n\n【67】but they also can modestly affect volume removal. When added to a loop diuretic, the combination potentiates diuresis due to sequential receptor blockade in the ascending loop of Henle and the distal nephron.\n\n【68】Thiazides are especially useful in patients with long-term loop diuretic use because they help overcome the decreased loop diuretic response caused by hypertrophy of the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule.\n\n【69】Despite these well-known observations, studies supporting combination therapy include few patients and do not compare different therapy combinations.\n\n【70】Oral metolazone plus furosemide for home therapy in patients with refractory heart failure.\n\n【71】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【72】Clinically, combination therapy can cause profound electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia, which requires close monitoring in the inpatient and outpatient settings.\n\n【73】Although there are no comparative data among the thiazide diuretics, metolazone and chlorothiazide tend to be favored, although hydrocholorothiazide and chlorthalidone can also be considered. We recommend metolazone, which should be administered infrequently (ie, 2.5-5 mg every 48 hours) owing to its long half-life. For patients who cannot take oral medications, we favor chlorothiazide (250-500 mg twice daily), which is available in a more expensive intravenous formulation.\n\n【74】#### Aldosterone Antagonists\n\n【75】Table 2 summarizes the data for spironolactone, a nonselective mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, and eplerenone, a newer medication with minimal effects on sex steroid receptors.\n\n【76】Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction.\n\n【77】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【78】The effect of spironolactone on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure: Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study Investigators.\n\n【79】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【80】Eplerenone in patients with systolic heart failure and mild symptoms.\n\n【81】In select patients, low-dose therapy decreases morbidity and mortality when added to standard HF medications owing to cardiac antifibrotic effects and beneficial cardiac remodeling.\n\n【82】Randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of aldosterone antagonism with eplerenone on ventricular remodeling in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.\n\n【83】Furthermore, higher-dose therapy leads to diuresis by blocking renal salt-retaining aldosterone receptors.\n\n【84】In contrast to low-dose therapy, high-dose therapy was evaluated in only 1 trial, which enrolled 100 patients with ADHF to receive either placebo or 50 to 100 mg of spironolactone. By the third day, treatment was associated with decreased edema, orthopnea, and NT-pro-BNP levels (2488 pg/mL vs 1555 pg/mL).\n\n【85】However, there were no differences in length of stay, and renal function worsened (20% in the spironolactone group had a ≥0.3 mg/dL rise in serum creatinine concentration compared with 4%), with no differences in serum potassium levels. Despite being the largest trial of its kind, this was a small study conducted at a single center in Portugal; the assessing physicians were not blinded to the treatment, and patient assignments were not randomized. Therefore, these results call for a definitive, larger, randomized controlled trial.\n\n【86】Table 2 Aldosterone Antagonist Comparison\n\n【87】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【88】AMI = acute myocardial infarction; CHF = congestive heart failure; EF = ejection fraction; HR = hazard ratio; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SCD = sudden cardiac death.\n\n【89】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【90】SI conversion factor: To convert creatinine values to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4.\n\n| Characteristic | Spironolactone | Eplerenone | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n【92】a AMI = acute myocardial infarction; CHF = congestive heart failure; EF = ejection fraction; HR = hazard ratio; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SCD = sudden cardiac death.\n\n【93】b SI conversion factor: To convert creatinine values to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4.\n\n【94】c Caution: estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> or potassium levels of 5.0 mmol/L or greater.\n\n【95】#### Vasopressin Antagonists\n\n【96】Solute-free water diuretics, or aquaretics, work via vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) antagonism and include lixivaptan, tolvaptan, and conivaptan. Although they are mostly used to correct hyponatremia, they have also been evaluated for ADHF treatment owing to their diuretic properties. For tolvaptan, it was first clinically evaluated in the ACTIV in CHF (Acute and Chronic Therapeutic Impact of a Vasopressin Antagonist in Congestive Heart Failure) study, in which 319 hospitalized patients with persistent congestive ADHF were randomized to receive tolvaptan (either 30, 60, or 90 mg/d) or placebo in addition to standard HF therapy. In the first 24 hours, there was a trend toward greater weight loss in the tolvaptan groups ( _P_ <.08 for all groups vs placebo) and increased serum sodium levels, with no adverse changes in potassium levels or renal function.\n\n【97】Improvement in hyponatremia during hospitalization for worsening heart failure is associated with improved outcomes: insights from the Acute and Chronic Therapeutic Impact of a Vasopressin Antagonist in Chronic Heart Failure (ACTIV in CHF) trial.\n\n【98】Subsequently, the much larger, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4133-patient EVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan) trial revealed a benefit with tolvaptan therapy, leading to significant weight reduction and improved dyspnea scores in the first 24 hours, as well as decreasing edema by day 7.\n\n【99】Clinical course of patients with hyponatremia and decompensated systolic heart failure and the effect of vasopressin receptor antagonism with tolvaptan.\n\n【100】Despite the short-term benefits, there were no long-term differences in all-cause mortality or hospitalizations at median follow-up of almost 10 months.\n\n【101】Similar to tolvaptan, lixivaptan has shown potential benefit in diuresis. In 1 study, 42 patients with mild-to-moderate HF were randomized to receive either placebo or 1 of 6 different doses of lixivaptan. There were significant and dose-related increases in urine volume at 24 hours, with the highest lixivaptan dose (400 mg) yielding an average of 3.9 L of urine output compared with 1.8 L with placebo ( _P_ <.01).\n\n【102】Because there are no large-scale trials, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved lixivaptan and is awaiting data from the BALANCE (Treatment of Hyponatremia Based on Lixivaptan in NYHA Class III/IV Cardiac Patient Evaluation) trial, which aims to enroll 650 patients with ADHF and a serum sodium level less than 135 mEq/L (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0).\n\n【103】Rationale and design of the treatment of hyponatremia based on lixivaptan in NYHA class III/IV cardiac patient evaluation (THE BALANCE) study.\n\n【104】Compared with other “vaptans,” conivaptan is unique because it is administered intravenously. Although there are no large studies, conivaptan can improve diuresis when added to loop diuretics. A pilot study in 170 hospitalized patients with worsening ADHF were randomized to receive conivaptan (loading dose plus 2 successive infusions of 40, 80, or 120 mg/d) or placebo in addition to standard loop diuretic therapy. At each dose range, initial urine output was significantly increased at 24 and 48 hours.\n\n【105】However, many patients had infusion-site phlebitis (17.5%-33%, depending on the dose), but there were no other adverse effects, such as changes in vital signs, electrolyte levels, or cardiac rhythms.\n\n【106】In summary, although vaptans may help in the short-term in patients with ADHF and hyponatremia, current studies suggest that they do not decrease mortality rates or have long-term benefits. If used, patients require close monitoring because antidiuretic hormone antagonists can lead to rapid increases in sodium levels.\n\n【107】### Dopamine\n\n【108】Intravenous dopamine induces natriuresis and diuresis by increasing renal vasodilatation and blood flow through activation of renal-specific dopamine (DA) DA <sub>1 </sub> and DA <sub>2 </sub> receptors\n\n【109】Dopamine-1 and dopamine-2 mechanisms in the control of renal function.\n\n【110】and inhibition of proximal tubular Na <sup>+ </sup> /H <sup>+ </sup> and Na <sup>+ </sup> K <sup>+ </sup> ATPase pumps.\n\n【111】Dopamine purportedly selectively activates receptors in a dose-dependent manner, with low doses (2-5 μg/kg per minute) predominantly affecting DA <sub>1 </sub> and DA <sub>2 </sub> receptors and higher doses activating β and then α vasoreceptors.\n\n【112】Dopamine-1 and dopamine-2 mechanisms in the control of renal function.\n\n【113】This physiologic finding inspired the concept of using low-dose (“renal-dose”) dopamine to enhance diuresis in ADHF; however, this strategy has been clinically disappointing. Multiple systematic reviews have noted no meaningful benefits with low-dose dopamine therapy.\n\n【114】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【115】A 2005 meta-analysis of 61 trials encompassing 3259 patients showed no differences in mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, or adverse events. In this study, urine output increased 24% in the first 24 hours.\n\n【116】Because only 1 small study included in these reviews specifically included patients with HF,\n\n【117】3 studies were conducted evaluating low-dose dopamine for ADHF treatment. A retrospective study assessed 116 patients receiving furosemide by continuous infusion coupled with low-dose dopamine or bolus intravenous furosemide alone.\n\n【118】Continuous infusion of furosemide combined with low-dose dopamine compared to intermittent boluses in acutely decompensated heart failure is less nephrotoxic and carries a lower readmission at thirty days.\n\n【119】The patients in the dopamine/continuous furosemide arm had improved renal function, greater diuresis, fewer inpatient hospital days, and reduced 30-day readmission rates. However, the 2 groups had significantly different baseline characteristics, including worse renal function and a higher rate of aldosterone antagonist treatment in the dopamine group. The subsequent DAD-HF (Dopamine in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) study was the first to prospectively randomize patients with ADHF to receive either high-dose intravenous furosemide (20 mg/h) or low-dose intravenous furosemide (5 mg/h) coupled with 8 hours of low-dose dopamine (5 μg/kg per minute).\n\n【120】Impact of dopamine infusion on renal function in hospitalized heart failure patients: results of the Dopamine in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (DAD-HF) Trial.\n\n【121】There were no differences in diuresis, dyspnea scores, inpatient hospital days, mortality rates, renal function, or rehospitalization rates in the 60 patients enrolled in the study. Three years later, the ROSE-AHF (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure) trial supplanted DAD-HF as the largest randomized trial of low-dose dopamine in the HF population.\n\n【122】Low-dose dopamine or low-dose nesiritide in acute heart failure with renal dysfunction: the ROSE acute heart failure randomized trial.\n\n【123】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【124】Targeting the kidney in acute heart failure: can old drugs provide new benefit?

Compared with DAD-HF, ROSE-AHF used dopamine for longer (although at a lower dose), had no variations in diuretic dosing between the groups, and had a much larger study size. In the end, dopamine therapy did not affect urine output or renal function and at 60 days led to no differences in mortality or unscheduled outpatient or inpatient HF-related appointments.\n\n【126】Based on the previously mentioned trials, dopamine’s effect of renal vasodilation has not led to clinical benefits, perhaps due to variability in pharmacologic levels and heterogeneous responses to dopamine. Even in healthy individuals, a stable infusion dose of 3 μg/kg per minute of dopamine leads to unreliable dopamine plasma concentrations, varying between 1800 and 18,300 ng/L.\n\n【127】In patients with renal failure, dopamine’s renal vasodilatory effects are blunted and instead paradoxically increase renal resistance indices.\n\n【128】Similarly, patients with ADHF have reduced effects with dopamine infusion, requiring much higher–than-expected doses (4-6 μg/kg per minute) to augment peak renal blood flow and reduce renal vascular resistance. Furthermore, the sickest patients (NYHA class IV) have no dopamine-associated changes in renal vascular resistance or the fraction of cardiac output dedicated to renal perfusion.\n\n【129】Renal, but not systemic, hemodynamic effects of dopamine are influenced by the severity of congestive heart failure.\n\n【130】Therefore, dopamine’s pharmacologic effects seem least effective in patients with severe ADHF or renal failure, likely at least partly explaining the observed lack of clinical benefit.\n\n【131】As summarized in Table 3 , the routine use of dopamine for augmented diuresis or renal protection is not supported by recent studies. In patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, it is reasonable to use dopamine only transiently to increase blood pressure and cardiac output.\n\n【132】### Nesiritide\n\n【133】The effects of BNP seem perfectly tailored to therapeutic exploitation: augmented natriuresis, sympatholysis, antiproliferative effects, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition. Based on 2 trials showing a reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and improvement in dyspnea after 3 hours of therapy,\n\n【134】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【135】Intravenous nesiritide, a natriuretic peptide, in the treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure.\n\n【136】synthetic BNP (nesiritide) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for clinical use.\n\n【137】A year later, the PRECEDENT (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Cardiac Ectopy With Dobutamine or Nesiritide Therapy) trial was published, which showed symptomatic improvements with nesiritide compared with dobutamine, with lower rates of ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n【138】Effect of nesiritide (b-type natriuretic peptide) and dobutamine on ventricular arrhythmias in the treatment of patients with acutely decompensated congestive heart failure: the PRECEDENT study.\n\n【139】By 2004, nesiritide was in widespread use in various off-label clinical settings despite the lack of documented clinical benefits. These settings included prolonged infusions in patients awaiting heart transplants, 1-time doses given as first-line therapy for ADHF in the emergency department, and intermittent, scheduled injections in outpatient infusion clinics in patients with chronic HF.\n\n【140】However, 2 meta-analyses published in 2005 noted increased renal failure, hypotension, and mortality rates in patients treated with nesiritide, prompting further studies.\n\n【141】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【142】The first subsequent randomized study, the FUSION II (Second Follow-up Serial Infusions of Nesiritide) trial, showed no clinical benefits with serial outpatient nesiritide infusions.\n\n【143】Safety and efficacy of outpatient nesiritide in patients with advanced heart failure: results of the Second Follow-Up Serial Infusions of Nesiritide (FUSION II) trial.\n\n【144】Then, 2 large-scale trials evaluated inpatient nesiritide therapy. The first, the ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure) trial, randomized 7141 patients to receive nesiritide (0.01 μg/kg per minute for at least 24 hours and up to 7 days) or placebo therapy.\n\n【145】effect of nesiritide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【146】There were no significant improvements in self-reported dyspnea rates at 6 and 24 hours and no differences in death or HF hospitalization rates.\n\n【147】Effects of nesiritide and predictors of urine output in acute decompensated heart failure: results from ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure).\n\n【148】However, nesiritide use led to more adverse events, especially hypotension (26.6% vs 15.3%; _P_ ≤.001). The second trial, the previously mentioned ROSE-AHF study,\n\n【149】Targeting the kidney in acute heart failure: can old drugs provide new benefit? Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (ROSE AHF) trial.\n\n【150】specifically targeted patients with ADHF and renal failure. Compared with placebo use, low-dose (0.005 μg/kg per minute) nesiritide therapy was not associated with improvements in urine output, renal function, symptoms, mortality rates, or rehospitalization rates. In addition, nesiritide therapy led to higher symptomatic hypotension rates.\n\n【151】Although there may remain a yet-undiscovered niche use, the ASCEND-HF and ROSE-AHF trials indicate no current role for nesiritide in augmenting urine output or renal function in patients with ADHF. Nesiritide should be used only after proven treatment strategies have not improved symptoms (and then only in select inpatients who are not hypotensive or in cardiogenic shock), and expectations for therapeutic success should be tempered by knowledge of these recent negative clinical studies. Table 3 summarizes the pharmacologic properties of nesiritide and the relevant clinical trials.\n\n【152】Table 3 Summary of Mechanisms of Action and Recent Evidence for Dopamine and Nesiritide in ADHF\n\n| Therapy | Mechanisms of action | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【154】ADHF = acute decompensated heart failure; PCWP = pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; RAAS = renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\n【155】### Ultrafiltration\n\n【156】Although first considered in 1908, venovenous ultrafiltration (UF) was not used in the HF population until low-impact devices were developed. Modern UF machines typically use 2 peripheral venous catheters, thus avoiding the complications of large-bore central venous access.\n\n【157】These catheters are attached to a machine with 2 pumps and a blood filter circuit. Within a minute, blood rapidly circulates through a special filter, sheds excess water and salt through aquapheresis, and then returns back to the patient. By design, UF machines are relatively easy to use, do not require intensive care unit or dialysis center monitoring, and have limited settings focused on adjusting the rate of isotonic fluid removal (which is usually restricted to a maximum of 0.5 L/h). Ultrafiltration is very effective at removing fluid, averaging 4.7 L for a single session, 7.1 L in 2 sessions, and 8.6 L during a hospitalization.\n\n【158】Ultrafiltration versus usual care for hospitalized patients with heart failure: the Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (RAPID-CHF) trial.\n\n【159】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【160】Outcomes of volume-overloaded cardiovascular patients treated with ultrafiltration.\n\n【161】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【162】Early on, several smaller studies suggested a promising future for UF.\n\n【163】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【164】Isolated ultrafiltration in moderate congestive heart failure.\n\n【165】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【166】Sustained improvement in functional capacity after removal of body fluid with isolated ultrafiltration in chronic cardiac insufficiency: failure of furosemide to provide the same result.\n\n【167】By 2005, larger trials emerged, which are summarized in Table 4 . The first study was the RAPID-CHF (Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure) trial, which randomized 40 patients with concomitant renal insufficiency to receive a single 8-hour UF session or usual care.\n\n【168】Ultrafiltration versus usual care for hospitalized patients with heart failure: the Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (RAPID-CHF) trial.\n\n【169】The UF group lost more volume (4.7 L vs 2.8 L; _P_ \\=.001) and had less dyspnea. Adding a second UF session was even more effective, with continued higher volume removal at 48 hours (8.4 L vs 5.4 L; _P_ \\=.012). Subsequently, the 200-patient UNLOAD (Ultrafiltration vs IV Diuretics for Patients Hospitalized for Acute Decompensated CHF) trial demonstrated similar results, with the UF group having greater mean ± SD weight loss (5.0±3.1 kg vs 3.1±3.5 kg; _P_ \\=.001) and water removal (4.6 L vs 3.3 L; _P_ \\=.001) at 48 hours but with no differences in dyspnea.\n\n【170】UNLOAD Trial Investigators  \nUltrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【171】By 90 days, the UF group had a mean ± SD lower risk of HF rehospitalization (0.22±0.54 vs 0.46±0.76; _P_ \\=.022) and fewer unscheduled clinic visits (21% vs 44%; _P_ \\=.009). There were no differences in renal function or mortality rates.\n\n【172】A randomized, controlled trial of the renal effects of ultrafiltration as compared to furosemide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【173】Table 4 Summary of Mechanisms of Action and Recent Evidence for UF in ADHF\n\n| Mechanisms of action | Evidence |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【175】ADHF = acute decompensated heart failure; UF = ultrafiltration.\n\n【176】Despite these promising results, the trials were criticized because the usual care groups were not aggressively treated with diuretics as most received only double their outpatient diuretic regimen. For the subset treated more aggressively, diuretic therapy was similar to UF in reducing fluid (−4.6 L vs −3.9 L) and weight (5.0 kg vs 3.6 kg).\n\n【177】UNLOAD Trial Investigators  \nUltrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【178】In response, the CARRESS-HF (Cardiorenal Rescue Study in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) trial was then performed, which randomized 188 patients with ADHF, worsened renal function (creatinine level ≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline), and persistent intravascular congestion to receive UF or diuretic therapy.\n\n【179】Ultrafiltration in decompensated heart failure with cardiorenal syndrome.\n\n【180】In contrast to previous trials, usual care patients were initially treated with high-dose loop diuretics and then received additional thiazide diuretics, inotropes, or vasodilators if urine output was inadequate. As a result, there were no differences in mean ± SD weight loss at 96 hours (5.5±5.1 kg vs 5.7±3.9 kg; _P_ \\=.58), but the UF group had more serious adverse events (72% vs 57%; _P_ \\=.03), mainly due to bleeding and catheter-related complications, and worsened mean ± SD serum creatinine levels (0.23±0.7 mg/dL vs −0.04±0.53 mg/dL; _P_ \\=.003). Aside from the use of more intensive medical therapy, the enrollment of only patients with evidence of worsened renal function (cardiorenal syndrome) in CARRESS-HF may explain the disparate results between it and the UNLOAD studies.\n\n【181】In conclusion, UF is effective in removing fluid in patients with ADHF but is associated with increased risks, mainly due to vascular access complications (vein access, bleeding, trauma, and infection). Based on the current evidence, UF is similarly efficacious to optimally dosed diuretic therapy, costs more, and requires close patient supervision. Therefore, UF should not be initially considered, although it may prove useful in diuretic-refractory patients with ADHF. Because equipoise exists regarding appropriate use of UF in ADHF, a larger, 800-patient, randomized controlled trial was undertaken, but it was terminated due to patient recruitment challenges.\n\n【182】Preventive Strategies\n---------------------\n\n【183】### Fluid and Salt Restriction\n\n【184】Neurohormonal imbalances created by HF lead to an inability to excrete sodium and water. Therefore, conventional wisdom has advised limiting the intake of both because one cannot accumulate what one does not ingest. Early studies suggested that patients with HF on high-salt diets have an inability to augment ventricular contractility, plasma natriuretic factors, and urine sodium excretion.\n\n【185】Abnormalities of sodium handling and of cardiovascular adaptations during high salt diet in patients with mild heart failure.\n\n【186】However, these responses seem to be different in patients treated with typical modern pharmacologic therapies (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists). In fact, 1 study showed that these patients have similar responses to controls when exposed to high salt loads, augmenting the cardiac index and stroke volume while decreasing peripheral vascular resistance and suppressing angiotensin II and norepinephrine levels. Moreover, continued high-salt diet exposure did not lead to ADHF.\n\n【187】Hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses to changes in sodium intake in compensated heart failure.\n\n【188】In contrast, sodium restriction led to no change in NYHA classifications but increases in aldosterone, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels.\n\n【189】Regarding clinically relevant outcomes, recent studies also contradict commonly held beliefs correlating increases in sodium intake (and, therefore, total body fluid retention and increased weight) with ADHF. In 1 study, patients presenting to the emergency department with HF did not consume more high-sodium food in the preceding 3 days.\n\n【190】In another study, most patients (∼54%) did not have a significant change in weight before developing ADHF.\n\n【191】In yet another study, which collected data from implantable hemodynamic monitoring systems in patients with HF, weight gain did not precede ADHF; instead, most had increased intracardiac filling pressures first.\n\n【192】Transition from chronic compensated to acute decompensated heart failure: pathophysiological insights obtained from continuous monitoring of intracardiac pressures.\n\n【193】Intriguingly, 2 randomized controlled trials evaluating different sodium intake diets also suggested no benefit to sodium restriction. In the first trial, recently admitted patients randomized to the less-restricted diet (2.8 g) had fewer readmissions at 180 days (8% vs 26%) and lower plasma renin, aldosterone, and BNP levels compared with patients randomized to the more sodium-restricted diet (1.8 g/d).\n\n【194】However, this trial required unusually high doses of furosemide (250-500 mg twice daily) and unrealistically limited fluid intake to 1000 mL/d. A subsequent trial by the same group randomized patients to receive 1.8 g vs 2.8 g of sodium per day and 1 L vs 2 L of fluid per day and used lower doses of furosemide (125-250 mg twice daily). Again, higher sodium intake was associated with decreased readmissions at 180 days (adjusted odds ratio of 2.46) and improved neurohormonal markers.\n\n【195】Medium term effects of different dosage of diuretic, sodium, and fluid administration on neurohormonal and clinical outcome in patients with recently compensated heart failure.\n\n【196】In contrast to the previously mentioned trials, a recent cohort study evaluated sodium intake over 6 days in 123 patients with systolic HF and found that patients in the highest tertile of sodium consumption had a higher risk of mortality and all-cause hospitalizations (combined adjusted hazard ratio of 2.55 vs the lowest tertile).\n\n【197】A high-sodium diet is associated with acute decompensated heart failure in ambulatory heart failure patients: a prospective follow-up study.\n\n【198】These patients also had higher total daily fluid intake (2.4 L vs 2 L).\n\n【199】In the inpatient setting, sodium restriction also may not be beneficial. One study randomized 75 patients with ADHF to a fluid- or sodium-restricted diet (800 mL/d or 800 mg/d, respectively) or an unrestricted diet for 3 days.\n\n【200】There were no differences in dosages of loop diuretics and no differences in length of stay, renal function, clinical congestion, body weight, or readmission rates. However, perceived thirst was significantly worse in the sodium- and fluid-restricted groups.\n\n【201】Finally, a research team evaluated combining high-dose furosemide with high-dose hypertonic saline (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% saline) in patients with diuretic-refractory ADHF, randomizing 107 patients to receive this unique therapy vs high-dose furosemide (500-1000 mg/d) therapy alone. The group receiving hypertonic saline had improved diuresis, natriuresis, and renal function, with lower readmission (47% vs 79%) and mortality (45% vs 87%) rates during the 48-month follow-up period.\n\n【202】Effects of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution infusion in comparison with a high dose of furosemide as bolus in refractory congestive heart failure: long-term effects.\n\n【203】Of note, the patients in both groups received far higher doses of intravenous furosemide (500-1000 mg/d) than is usual; thus, this trial needs to be replicated with standard diuretic treatments before endorsing hypertonic saline therapy.\n\n【204】Previously, the American Heart Association, the European Society of Cardiology, and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society had recommended sodium and water restriction in patients with HF. However, given the previously noted data and a recent Cochrane Review citing the potential for increased harm,\n\n【205】the most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines do not endorse any specific level of sodium or fluid intake in patients with stage C and D HF.\n\n【206】2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.\n\n【207】Because this is controversial,\n\n【208】well-conducted large-scale trials are needed to definitively determine the role of sodium and water in patients with HF.\n\n【209】### Monitoring Strategies\n\n【210】There is a strong interest in the early detection of ADHF because early treatment can prevent morbidity and hospitalizations.\n\n【211】Therefore, considerable research has focused on invasive and noninvasive early-warning monitoring methods.\n\n【212】#### Noninvasive Strategies\n\n【213】Telemonitoring allows for remote monitoring of weights and symptoms, ideally prompting rapid therapeutic changes in the outpatient setting. One of the earliest large randomized controlled trials to show benefit enrolled 280 outpatients with NYHA class III and IV symptoms. Clinicians were required to review proprietary home monitoring system data daily and adjust medications accordingly. Telemonitoring led to unexpectedly lower mortality rates (absolute risk reduction = 10.3%; _P_ \\=.003), although there were no differences in 6-month hospitalization rates, the primary end point.\n\n【214】Randomized trial of a daily electronic home monitoring system in patients with advanced heart failure: the Weight Monitoring in Heart Failure (WHARF) trial.\n\n【215】Subsequent well-conducted trials have not shown benefits in morbidity or mortality rates. The Tele-HF (Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes) trial used a different telemonitoring system that required patients to report daily symptoms and weights. These data were reviewed by clinicians who adjusted patients’ HF medications. Because this required considerable effort (reviewing >3 data reports per week), adherence was only 55% in the telemonitoring group, likely explaining the lack of differences in 6-month readmission or death rates.\n\n【216】Telemonitoring in patients with heart failure.\n\n【217】Another trial, the TIM-HF (Telemedical Interventional Monitoring in Heart Failure) trial, prospectively evaluated telemedical management in 710 patients with NYHA class II and III HF. Despite using a more sophisticated system, which automatically transmitted 3-lead electrocardiographic data, blood pressure, and daily weights, there were no differences in mortality or HF hospitalization rates.\n\n【218】Impact of remote telemedical management on mortality and hospitalizations in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure: the telemedical interventional monitoring in heart failure study.\n\n【219】Given the limited value of telemonitoring, manufacturers have developed alternative monitoring devices. One noninvasive device uses multiple sensors to detect changes in thoracic electrical impedance and then performs impedance cardiography (ICG) to estimate aortic blood flow and other hemodynamic parameters.\n\n【220】In the PREDICT (Prospective Evaluation of Cardiac Decompensation in Patients With Heart Failure by Impedance Cardiography Test) trial, 212 patients with HF underwent biweekly clinical assessments and ICG measurements for 26 weeks. Researchers synthesized the ICG data to develop a composite score highly predictive of clinical events in the ensuing 14 days.\n\n【221】Utility of impedance cardiography for the identification of short-term risk of clinical decompensation in stable patients with chronic heart failure.\n\n【222】Now, ICG is being further evaluated in the PREVENT-HF (Prevention of Heart Failure Events With Impedance Cardiography Testing) trial, which will determine whether ICG analysis can help prevent hospitalizations.\n\n【223】Another strategy uses the VeriCor left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) monitor (VeriCor Medical Systems), which noninvasively measures radial artery blood pressure and lung pressures during the Valsalva maneuver to estimate LVEDP.\n\n【224】Evaluation of a noninvasive system for determining left ventricular filling pressure.\n\n【225】In a recent trial, 25 hospitalized patients were randomized to treatment guided by VeriCor monitor–estimated LVEDP levels, and another 25 were treated based on clinical signs alone. The intervention group had lower LVEDPs at hospital discharge (19.7 mm Hg vs 25.6 mm Hg; _P_ \\=.01) as well as decreased rehospitalization rates (16% vs 48% at 1-year follow-up).\n\n【226】Noninvasive monitoring of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure reduces rehospitalization rates in patients hospitalized for heart failure: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【227】These results are encouraging; however, a larger randomized controlled trial is needed to fully evaluate the VeriCor system before recommending widespread use.\n\n【228】#### Invasive Monitoring\n\n【229】Compared with noninvasive devices, implantable hemodynamic monitors (IHMs) have the ability to continuously monitor real-time cardiac hemodynamics. In theory, IHM can help practitioners adjust HF medications and optimize intravascular fluid status in inpatient and outpatient settings. The first IHM device, Chronicle (Medtronic Inc), was similar to a single-lead pacemaker. Essentially, a pressure-monitoring transvenous lead was positioned in the right ventricular outflow tract that then transmitted data to a subcutaneously placed device. While promising, the COMPASS-HF (Chronicle Offers Management to Patients With Advanced Signs and Symptoms of Heart Failure) trial showed no advantage to IHM-guided therapy compared with optimal medical management.\n\n【230】Randomized controlled trial of an implantable continuous hemodynamic monitor in patients with advanced heart failure: the COMPASS-HF study.\n\n【231】A subsequent trial, REDUCEhf (Reducing Events in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure), which combined Chronicle technology with an implantable cardiac defibrillator, also showed no benefits.\n\n【232】Continuous hemodynamic monitoring in patients with mild to moderate heart failure: results of the Reducing Decompensation Events Utilizing Intracardiac Pressures in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure (REDUCEhf) trial.\n\n【233】With this combined device, there were also safety concerns because the increased complexity resulting from implanting 2 separate leads in the right ventricular led to an intolerably high risk of IHM lead failure (4% at 4 years).\n\n【234】Another means of invasive monitoring was studied in FAST (Fluid Accumulation Status Trial), a prospective, double-blind study evaluating intrathoracic impedance measurements in predicting HF events.\n\n【235】Intrathoracic impedance vs daily weight monitoring for predicting worsening heart failure events: results of the Fluid Accumulation Status Trial (FAST).\n\n【236】Patients with previously implanted cardioverter defibrillators received a software update (OptiVol; Medtronic Inc) that recorded intrathoracic impedance. The sensitivity of the software to predict HF events was superior compared with that of following changes in weight (76% vs 23%; _P_ <.001). The FAST trial prompted the DOT-HF (Diagnostic Outcome Trial in HF) trial, which randomized 335 patients with HF to receive ambulatory management based on intrathoracic impedance via OptiVol or usual care.\n\n【237】Intrathoracic impedance monitoring, audible patient alerts, and outcome in patients with heart failure.\n\n【238】No clinical benefits were observed with OptiVol-guided therapy; in fact, there were increased ambulatory visits and HF hospitalizations. Of note, this trial was terminated early owing to slow enrollment, with only 355 patients enrolled in a planned 2400-patient study.\n\n【239】In contrast to the previously mentioned IHM devices, the CardioMEMS device (St Jude Medical) is associated with clinical improvements. This device is implanted in the pulmonary artery and measures pressure waveforms in the distal pulmonary artery. In the CHAMPION-HF (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Class III Heart Failure Subjects) trial, the device was implanted in 550 patients with NYHA class III HF, who were then randomized to a treatment group, which allowed clinicians to use device data for management, or a control group.\n\n【240】Wireless pulmonary artery haemodynamic monitoring in chronic heart failure: a randomised controlled trial.\n\n【241】删除21:<u>CardioMEMS monitoring led to a 28% reduction in HF-related hospitalizations at 6 months and a 37% reduction during follow-up. The intervention group had shorter hospital stays (2.2 days vs 3.8 days) and an improved quality of life. Most importantly, the device was safe, without significant adverse events. Despite controversy about whether this trial adequately blinded CardioMEMS output in the control group, the FDA approved CardioMEMS in 2014.</u>\n\n【242】Although CardioMEMS is the only FDA-approved device, several other IHMs are currently under development. Two notable IHMs are HeartPod (St Jude Medical) and a system developed by Remon Medical Technologies. In brief, HeartPod monitors left atrial pressures and is currently being evaluated in a large randomized controlled trial.\n\n【243】In a pilot trial, 40 patients with NYHA class III or IV HF had an average reduction in left atrial pressures from 17.6 mm Hg in the first 3 months to 14.8 mm Hg; however, the study was underpowered to detect clinical differences.\n\n【244】Physician-directed patient self-management of left atrial pressure in advanced chronic heart failure.\n\n【245】The other device (Remon Medical Technologies) has shown promise in a pilot trial and is currently being evaluated in the PAPIRUS III (Monitoring Pulmonary Artery Pressure by Implantable Device Responding to Ultrasonic Signal) trial.\n\n【246】All in all, IHM devices have a promising future, and we believe that their role in managing HF will continue to evolve as more devices are studied and come to market. Table 5 summarizes the data available for the various preventive strategies.\n\n【247】Table 5 Summary of Preventive Strategies and Recent Evidence\n\n| Intervention | Evidence | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【249】ACC = American College of Cardiology; AHA = American Heart Association; FDA = Food and Drug Administration; HF = heart failure; ICD = implantable cardioverter defibrillator; ICG = impedence cardiography; IHM = implantable hemodynamic monitor; LVEDP = left ventricular end diastolic pressure; NYHA = New York Heart Association; RCT = randomized controlled trial; RV = right ventricular.\n\n【250】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【251】Volume overload remains a vexing clinical problem. Previously, clinicians relied on physiologic and pharmacologic principles to guide them in treating and preventing volume overload in these patients. However, as this review illustrates, high-quality clinical trials have provided evidence to guide clinicians in the day-to-day treatment of patients with ADHF. Intriguing small studies have hinted that perhaps not all loop diuretics are created equal and call for larger rigorous clinical trials. Large, well-conducted clinical trials evaluating nesiritide and dopamine suggest that neither drug has a major role in ADHF management. Ultrafiltration remains a promising modality for fluid removal for diuretic-refractory patients, but clinical studies do not suggest benefit for most patients compared with optimal diuretic therapy. The age-old principle of sodium restriction has been called into question by observational and clinical studies, and further prospective investigation is required. Finally, we are at the dawn of the era of invasive hemodynamic monitoring for HF management. However, as we evaluate this exciting new technology, we must remember that it is our duty to ensure that it meets the same standard we require of all other therapies: sound clinical evidence suggesting benefit in treating or preventing volume overload in patients with HF.", "index": 3155, "show": true, "start": 3142, "end": 3272, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【21】删除21:Although treatments have improved, acute decompensated HF (ADHF) remains the leading cause of hospitalization, has a 50% 5-year mortality rate, and is costly, accounting for $30.7 billion in health care expenditures in 2012.", "content": "【0】Volume Overload in Heart Failure\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】Acute decompensated heart failure is the leading cause of hospital admission in the United States, with a high risk of readmission within 30 days.

As a result, neurohormonal pathways are up-regulated, including the sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and vasopressin (or antidiuretic hormone) axis. Temporarily, mean arterial pressure and cardiac output increase to levels adequate for tissue perfusion; however, chronic neurohormonal activation is eventually deleterious, leading to salt and water retention and subsequent worsening of cardiac output.\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】Ultimately, excessive activation manifests with the familiar signs and symptoms of volume overload—the leading cause of ADHF hospitalizations.\n\n【26】In this review, we focus on treatments to remove excess fluid and prevent its accumulation in patients with HF, emphasizing recent clinical trials. All the references cited in this review have been obtained through PubMed using the following key words: _heart failure and volume overload, congestion, loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, dopamine, cardiorenal syndrome, nesiritide, vasopressin antagonists, ultrafiltration, sodium restriction, fluid restriction, telemonitoring_ , and _invasive hemodynamic monitoring_ . We also reviewed relevant references cited in the obtained articles, especially articles addressing methods of treating or preventing volume overload in patients with HF.\n\n【27】Strategies for Fluid Removal\n----------------------------\n\n【28】### Diuretic Therapy\n\n【29】Diuretics are the mainstay of therapy in patients with congestive HF. Loop diuretics, which inhibit the Na-K-2Cl transport symporter, leading to decreased sodium absorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle, are most commonly used. If loop diuretics are not sufficient, additional synergistic diuretics that affect either the NaCl cotransporter (thiazides) or the renal mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone antagonists) are used.\n\n【30】#### Loop Diuretics\n\n【31】Loop diuretics, which include furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, and ethacrynic acid, are all generic. In the United States, furosemide was introduced much earlier than bumetanide and torsemide and is most commonly used. As a result, 87% of inpatients with ADHF are treated with furosemide, 3% with bumetanide, 0.4% with torsemide, and 10% with a combination of synergistic diuretics.\n\n【32】Dominance of furosemide for loop diuretic therapy in heart failure: time to revisit the alternatives?\n\n【33】Comparatively, loop diuretics are structurally similar, except for ethacrynic acid, which lacks a sulfa moiety. However, it is associated with a greater risk of ototoxicity, relegating its use to patients with allergies to sulfa-containing medications.\n\n【34】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【35】The other loop diuretics do have important differences in their pharmacokinetics . For furosemide, the bioavailability ranges from 10% to 90%, with absorption decreasing in patients with severe ADHF-associated gut edema.\n\n【36】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【37】In contrast, bumetanide and torsemide are less affected by intestinal wall edema, allowing for higher and more predictable bioavailability ranging from 80% to 100%.\n\n【38】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【39】Once in the blood, concentration kinetics also differ; furosemide and bumetanide have half-lives of 1 to 3 hours and a 6- to 8-hour duration of action, and torsemide has a longer half-life at 4 to 6 hours, with a 12- to 18-hour duration of action.\n\n【40】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【41】Table 1 Loop Diuretic Comparison\n\n【42】<sup>a</sup>\n\n| Characteristic | Furosemide | Bumetanide | Torsemide |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| FDA approval year | 1966 | 1983 | 1993 |\n\n| Typical oral doses | 40-160 mg 1-2 times per dayMaximum: 600 mg/d | 0.5-4 mg 1-2 times per dayMaximum: 10 mg/d | 20-80 mg/dMaximum: 200 mg/d |\n\n【45】a FDA = Food and Drug Administration.\n\n【46】Compared with other loop diuretics, torsemide intrinsically blocks sympathetic nervous system and aldosterone activity, which may lead to favorable cardiac remodeling and decreased kaliuresis.\n\n【47】Effects of torasemide on cardiac sympathetic nerve activity and left ventricular remodelling in patients with congestive heart failure.\n\n【48】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【49】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【50】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【51】Torasemide versus furosemide in patients with congestive heart failure: a double-masked, randomized study.\n\n【52】In an open-label, randomized controlled trial, patients treated with torsemide were found to have decreased myocardial fibrosis on 8-month endomyocardial biopsy specimens.\n\n【53】Although intriguing, only a few clinical outcome studies have subsequently compared torsemide with other loop diuretics. In an open-label trial, 234 hospitalized patients with ADHF were randomized to receive either furosemide or torsemide and continued the same diuretic treatment for 1 year. Despite being a sicker group (ie, more previous admissions for ADHF), the torsemide group had lower ADHF readmission rates (17% vs 32%) and spent fewer days in the hospital (106 vs 296 total days). In addition, the torsemide group had less fatigue but had no change in dyspnea.\n\n【54】Open-label randomized trial of torsemide compared with furosemide therapy for patients with heart failure.\n\n【55】In the outpatient setting, torsemide was examined in the TORIC (Torasemide in Congestive Heart Failure) study, a nonrandomized, open-label, postmarketing, 1-year surveillance trial of 1377 patients that noted decreased overall mortality rates with torsemide use (2.2%) compared with other loop diuretic use (4.5%).\n\n【56】Forty-six percent of torsemide-treated patients also had improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class compared with 37.2% with other diuretic treatments. Finally, adverse electrolyte changes were less, with 3% of the torsemide group requiring potassium supplementation compared with 30% with other diuretics. Because this was a retrospective, nonrandomized study, a prospective, randomized, unblinded study was subsequently performed in 237 outpatients. Compared with furosemide, torsemide improved symptoms (40.2% vs 30.7% improved NYHA class); however, there were no differences in hospitalization or mortality rates.\n\n【57】In addition to the 4 “classic” loop diuretics, there is another, azosemide, with a longer duration of action. Theoretically, azosemide leads to decreased “rebound” activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system compared with shorter-acting diuretics. Clinically, 1 trial showed benefit in 320 patients with HF who were randomized to receive 2 years of treatment with 30 to 60 mg of azosemide vs 20 to 40 mg of daily furosemide, resulting in decreased HF hospitalization rates (hazard ratio, 0.53; _P_ \\=.04), with no change in overall mortality rates.\n\n【58】Superiority of long-acting to short-acting loop diuretics in the treatment of congestive heart failure.\n\n【59】This drug needs more study and is not currently available in the United States.\n\n【60】There remains a paucity of high-quality, double-blind, randomized controlled trial data despite the widespread use of loop diuretics. Comparative trials are urgently needed, especially for furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, and azosemide. In the meantime, we suggest that the available evidence favors torsemide use.\n\n【61】With any loop diuretic, clinicians treating inpatients with ADHF must also decide on a method for intravenous administration—either continuous infusion or intermittent boluses. Compared with intermittent boluses, continuous delivery theoretically leads to lower peak concentrations, less renal dysfunction and neurohormonal activation, and decreased “rebound” sodium and water retention. However, few studies compared the 2 methods until the DOSE (Diuretic Strategies in Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) trial was published in 2011. This trial was a prospective, double-blind trial randomizing 300 patients to receive either continuous vs bolus furosemide therapy and high- vs low-dose furosemide strategies.\n\n【62】Diuretic strategies in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【63】There were no differences in symptoms, creatinine levels, cystatin C levels, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels, likelihood of a switch to oral diuretics at 48 hours, or hospital length of stay in the continuous and bolus arms. At 72 hours, patients treated with the high-dose strategy had more fluid loss (4899 mL vs 3575 mL; _P_ \\=.001) and weight loss, improved dyspnea scores ( _P_ \\=.04), and a trend toward greater reduction in NT-pro-BNP levels (−1822 pg/mL vs −1194 pg/mL; _P_ \\=.06). However, there were no differences in hospital length of stay, mortality, or 60-day readmission rates, and a greater proportion had an increase in creatinine concentration by more than 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4) (23% vs 14%; _P_ \\=.04). Given the overall results of this well-conducted trial, there is no added benefit to routine continuous intravenous infusions over bolus administration of loop diuretics in the treatment of ADHF.\n\n【64】#### Thiazide Diuretics\n\n【65】Thiazide diuretics are typically used for hypertension treatment,\n\n【66】2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8).\n\n【67】but they also can modestly affect volume removal. When added to a loop diuretic, the combination potentiates diuresis due to sequential receptor blockade in the ascending loop of Henle and the distal nephron.\n\n【68】Thiazides are especially useful in patients with long-term loop diuretic use because they help overcome the decreased loop diuretic response caused by hypertrophy of the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule.\n\n【69】Despite these well-known observations, studies supporting combination therapy include few patients and do not compare different therapy combinations.\n\n【70】Oral metolazone plus furosemide for home therapy in patients with refractory heart failure.\n\n【71】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【72】Clinically, combination therapy can cause profound electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia, which requires close monitoring in the inpatient and outpatient settings.\n\n【73】Although there are no comparative data among the thiazide diuretics, metolazone and chlorothiazide tend to be favored, although hydrocholorothiazide and chlorthalidone can also be considered. We recommend metolazone, which should be administered infrequently (ie, 2.5-5 mg every 48 hours) owing to its long half-life. For patients who cannot take oral medications, we favor chlorothiazide (250-500 mg twice daily), which is available in a more expensive intravenous formulation.\n\n【74】#### Aldosterone Antagonists\n\n【75】Table 2 summarizes the data for spironolactone, a nonselective mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, and eplerenone, a newer medication with minimal effects on sex steroid receptors.\n\n【76】Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction.\n\n【77】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【78】The effect of spironolactone on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure: Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study Investigators.\n\n【79】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【80】Eplerenone in patients with systolic heart failure and mild symptoms.\n\n【81】In select patients, low-dose therapy decreases morbidity and mortality when added to standard HF medications owing to cardiac antifibrotic effects and beneficial cardiac remodeling.\n\n【82】Randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of aldosterone antagonism with eplerenone on ventricular remodeling in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.\n\n【83】Furthermore, higher-dose therapy leads to diuresis by blocking renal salt-retaining aldosterone receptors.\n\n【84】In contrast to low-dose therapy, high-dose therapy was evaluated in only 1 trial, which enrolled 100 patients with ADHF to receive either placebo or 50 to 100 mg of spironolactone. By the third day, treatment was associated with decreased edema, orthopnea, and NT-pro-BNP levels (2488 pg/mL vs 1555 pg/mL).\n\n【85】However, there were no differences in length of stay, and renal function worsened (20% in the spironolactone group had a ≥0.3 mg/dL rise in serum creatinine concentration compared with 4%), with no differences in serum potassium levels. Despite being the largest trial of its kind, this was a small study conducted at a single center in Portugal; the assessing physicians were not blinded to the treatment, and patient assignments were not randomized. Therefore, these results call for a definitive, larger, randomized controlled trial.\n\n【86】Table 2 Aldosterone Antagonist Comparison\n\n【87】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【88】AMI = acute myocardial infarction; CHF = congestive heart failure; EF = ejection fraction; HR = hazard ratio; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SCD = sudden cardiac death.\n\n【89】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【90】SI conversion factor: To convert creatinine values to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4.\n\n| Characteristic | Spironolactone | Eplerenone | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n【92】a AMI = acute myocardial infarction; CHF = congestive heart failure; EF = ejection fraction; HR = hazard ratio; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SCD = sudden cardiac death.\n\n【93】b SI conversion factor: To convert creatinine values to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4.\n\n【94】c Caution: estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> or potassium levels of 5.0 mmol/L or greater.\n\n【95】#### Vasopressin Antagonists\n\n【96】Solute-free water diuretics, or aquaretics, work via vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) antagonism and include lixivaptan, tolvaptan, and conivaptan. Although they are mostly used to correct hyponatremia, they have also been evaluated for ADHF treatment owing to their diuretic properties. For tolvaptan, it was first clinically evaluated in the ACTIV in CHF (Acute and Chronic Therapeutic Impact of a Vasopressin Antagonist in Congestive Heart Failure) study, in which 319 hospitalized patients with persistent congestive ADHF were randomized to receive tolvaptan (either 30, 60, or 90 mg/d) or placebo in addition to standard HF therapy. In the first 24 hours, there was a trend toward greater weight loss in the tolvaptan groups ( _P_ <.08 for all groups vs placebo) and increased serum sodium levels, with no adverse changes in potassium levels or renal function.\n\n【97】Improvement in hyponatremia during hospitalization for worsening heart failure is associated with improved outcomes: insights from the Acute and Chronic Therapeutic Impact of a Vasopressin Antagonist in Chronic Heart Failure (ACTIV in CHF) trial.\n\n【98】Subsequently, the much larger, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4133-patient EVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan) trial revealed a benefit with tolvaptan therapy, leading to significant weight reduction and improved dyspnea scores in the first 24 hours, as well as decreasing edema by day 7.\n\n【99】Clinical course of patients with hyponatremia and decompensated systolic heart failure and the effect of vasopressin receptor antagonism with tolvaptan.\n\n【100】Despite the short-term benefits, there were no long-term differences in all-cause mortality or hospitalizations at median follow-up of almost 10 months.\n\n【101】Similar to tolvaptan, lixivaptan has shown potential benefit in diuresis. In 1 study, 42 patients with mild-to-moderate HF were randomized to receive either placebo or 1 of 6 different doses of lixivaptan. There were significant and dose-related increases in urine volume at 24 hours, with the highest lixivaptan dose (400 mg) yielding an average of 3.9 L of urine output compared with 1.8 L with placebo ( _P_ <.01).\n\n【102】Because there are no large-scale trials, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved lixivaptan and is awaiting data from the BALANCE (Treatment of Hyponatremia Based on Lixivaptan in NYHA Class III/IV Cardiac Patient Evaluation) trial, which aims to enroll 650 patients with ADHF and a serum sodium level less than 135 mEq/L (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0).\n\n【103】Rationale and design of the treatment of hyponatremia based on lixivaptan in NYHA class III/IV cardiac patient evaluation (THE BALANCE) study.\n\n【104】Compared with other “vaptans,” conivaptan is unique because it is administered intravenously. Although there are no large studies, conivaptan can improve diuresis when added to loop diuretics. A pilot study in 170 hospitalized patients with worsening ADHF were randomized to receive conivaptan (loading dose plus 2 successive infusions of 40, 80, or 120 mg/d) or placebo in addition to standard loop diuretic therapy. At each dose range, initial urine output was significantly increased at 24 and 48 hours.\n\n【105】However, many patients had infusion-site phlebitis (17.5%-33%, depending on the dose), but there were no other adverse effects, such as changes in vital signs, electrolyte levels, or cardiac rhythms.\n\n【106】In summary, although vaptans may help in the short-term in patients with ADHF and hyponatremia, current studies suggest that they do not decrease mortality rates or have long-term benefits. If used, patients require close monitoring because antidiuretic hormone antagonists can lead to rapid increases in sodium levels.\n\n【107】### Dopamine\n\n【108】Intravenous dopamine induces natriuresis and diuresis by increasing renal vasodilatation and blood flow through activation of renal-specific dopamine (DA) DA <sub>1 </sub> and DA <sub>2 </sub> receptors\n\n【109】Dopamine-1 and dopamine-2 mechanisms in the control of renal function.\n\n【110】and inhibition of proximal tubular Na <sup>+ </sup> /H <sup>+ </sup> and Na <sup>+ </sup> K <sup>+ </sup> ATPase pumps.\n\n【111】Dopamine purportedly selectively activates receptors in a dose-dependent manner, with low doses (2-5 μg/kg per minute) predominantly affecting DA <sub>1 </sub> and DA <sub>2 </sub> receptors and higher doses activating β and then α vasoreceptors.\n\n【112】Dopamine-1 and dopamine-2 mechanisms in the control of renal function.\n\n【113】This physiologic finding inspired the concept of using low-dose (“renal-dose”) dopamine to enhance diuresis in ADHF; however, this strategy has been clinically disappointing. Multiple systematic reviews have noted no meaningful benefits with low-dose dopamine therapy.\n\n【114】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【115】A 2005 meta-analysis of 61 trials encompassing 3259 patients showed no differences in mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, or adverse events. In this study, urine output increased 24% in the first 24 hours.\n\n【116】Because only 1 small study included in these reviews specifically included patients with HF,\n\n【117】3 studies were conducted evaluating low-dose dopamine for ADHF treatment. A retrospective study assessed 116 patients receiving furosemide by continuous infusion coupled with low-dose dopamine or bolus intravenous furosemide alone.\n\n【118】Continuous infusion of furosemide combined with low-dose dopamine compared to intermittent boluses in acutely decompensated heart failure is less nephrotoxic and carries a lower readmission at thirty days.\n\n【119】The patients in the dopamine/continuous furosemide arm had improved renal function, greater diuresis, fewer inpatient hospital days, and reduced 30-day readmission rates. However, the 2 groups had significantly different baseline characteristics, including worse renal function and a higher rate of aldosterone antagonist treatment in the dopamine group. The subsequent DAD-HF (Dopamine in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) study was the first to prospectively randomize patients with ADHF to receive either high-dose intravenous furosemide (20 mg/h) or low-dose intravenous furosemide (5 mg/h) coupled with 8 hours of low-dose dopamine (5 μg/kg per minute).\n\n【120】Impact of dopamine infusion on renal function in hospitalized heart failure patients: results of the Dopamine in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (DAD-HF) Trial.\n\n【121】There were no differences in diuresis, dyspnea scores, inpatient hospital days, mortality rates, renal function, or rehospitalization rates in the 60 patients enrolled in the study. Three years later, the ROSE-AHF (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure) trial supplanted DAD-HF as the largest randomized trial of low-dose dopamine in the HF population.\n\n【122】Low-dose dopamine or low-dose nesiritide in acute heart failure with renal dysfunction: the ROSE acute heart failure randomized trial.\n\n【123】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【124】Targeting the kidney in acute heart failure: can old drugs provide new benefit? Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (ROSE AHF) trial.\n\n【125】In this trial, 360 patients with ADHF and renal dysfunction were randomized to receive diuretics with placebo, low-dose dopamine (2 μg/kg per minute), or low-dose nesiritide for 72 hours. Compared with DAD-HF, ROSE-AHF used dopamine for longer (although at a lower dose), had no variations in diuretic dosing between the groups, and had a much larger study size. In the end, dopamine therapy did not affect urine output or renal function and at 60 days led to no differences in mortality or unscheduled outpatient or inpatient HF-related appointments.\n\n【126】Based on the previously mentioned trials, dopamine’s effect of renal vasodilation has not led to clinical benefits, perhaps due to variability in pharmacologic levels and heterogeneous responses to dopamine. Even in healthy individuals, a stable infusion dose of 3 μg/kg per minute of dopamine leads to unreliable dopamine plasma concentrations, varying between 1800 and 18,300 ng/L.\n\n【127】In patients with renal failure, dopamine’s renal vasodilatory effects are blunted and instead paradoxically increase renal resistance indices.\n\n【128】Similarly, patients with ADHF have reduced effects with dopamine infusion, requiring much higher–than-expected doses (4-6 μg/kg per minute) to augment peak renal blood flow and reduce renal vascular resistance. Furthermore, the sickest patients (NYHA class IV) have no dopamine-associated changes in renal vascular resistance or the fraction of cardiac output dedicated to renal perfusion.\n\n【129】Renal, but not systemic, hemodynamic effects of dopamine are influenced by the severity of congestive heart failure.\n\n【130】Therefore, dopamine’s pharmacologic effects seem least effective in patients with severe ADHF or renal failure, likely at least partly explaining the observed lack of clinical benefit.\n\n【131】As summarized in Table 3 , the routine use of dopamine for augmented diuresis or renal protection is not supported by recent studies. In patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, it is reasonable to use dopamine only transiently to increase blood pressure and cardiac output.\n\n【132】### Nesiritide\n\n【133】The effects of BNP seem perfectly tailored to therapeutic exploitation: augmented natriuresis, sympatholysis, antiproliferative effects, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition. Based on 2 trials showing a reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and improvement in dyspnea after 3 hours of therapy,\n\n【134】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【135】Intravenous nesiritide, a natriuretic peptide, in the treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure.\n\n【136】synthetic BNP (nesiritide) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for clinical use.\n\n【137】A year later, the PRECEDENT (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Cardiac Ectopy With Dobutamine or Nesiritide Therapy) trial was published, which showed symptomatic improvements with nesiritide compared with dobutamine, with lower rates of ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n【138】Effect of nesiritide (b-type natriuretic peptide) and dobutamine on ventricular arrhythmias in the treatment of patients with acutely decompensated congestive heart failure: the PRECEDENT study.\n\n【139】By 2004, nesiritide was in widespread use in various off-label clinical settings despite the lack of documented clinical benefits. These settings included prolonged infusions in patients awaiting heart transplants, 1-time doses given as first-line therapy for ADHF in the emergency department, and intermittent, scheduled injections in outpatient infusion clinics in patients with chronic HF.\n\n【140】However, 2 meta-analyses published in 2005 noted increased renal failure, hypotension, and mortality rates in patients treated with nesiritide, prompting further studies.\n\n【141】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【142】The first subsequent randomized study, the FUSION II (Second Follow-up Serial Infusions of Nesiritide) trial, showed no clinical benefits with serial outpatient nesiritide infusions.\n\n【143】Safety and efficacy of outpatient nesiritide in patients with advanced heart failure: results of the Second Follow-Up Serial Infusions of Nesiritide (FUSION II) trial.\n\n【144】Then, 2 large-scale trials evaluated inpatient nesiritide therapy. The first, the ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure) trial, randomized 7141 patients to receive nesiritide (0.01 μg/kg per minute for at least 24 hours and up to 7 days) or placebo therapy.\n\n【145】effect of nesiritide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【146】There were no significant improvements in self-reported dyspnea rates at 6 and 24 hours and no differences in death or HF hospitalization rates.\n\n【147】Effects of nesiritide and predictors of urine output in acute decompensated heart failure: results from ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure).\n\n【148】However, nesiritide use led to more adverse events, especially hypotension (26.6% vs 15.3%; _P_ ≤.001). The second trial, the previously mentioned ROSE-AHF study,\n\n【149】Targeting the kidney in acute heart failure: can old drugs provide new benefit? Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (ROSE AHF) trial.\n\n【150】specifically targeted patients with ADHF and renal failure. Compared with placebo use, low-dose (0.005 μg/kg per minute) nesiritide therapy was not associated with improvements in urine output, renal function, symptoms, mortality rates, or rehospitalization rates. In addition, nesiritide therapy led to higher symptomatic hypotension rates.\n\n【151】Although there may remain a yet-undiscovered niche use, the ASCEND-HF and ROSE-AHF trials indicate no current role for nesiritide in augmenting urine output or renal function in patients with ADHF. Nesiritide should be used only after proven treatment strategies have not improved symptoms (and then only in select inpatients who are not hypotensive or in cardiogenic shock), and expectations for therapeutic success should be tempered by knowledge of these recent negative clinical studies. Table 3 summarizes the pharmacologic properties of nesiritide and the relevant clinical trials.\n\n【152】Table 3 Summary of Mechanisms of Action and Recent Evidence for Dopamine and Nesiritide in ADHF\n\n| Therapy | Mechanisms of action | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【154】ADHF = acute decompensated heart failure; PCWP = pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; RAAS = renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\n【155】### Ultrafiltration\n\n【156】Although first considered in 1908, venovenous ultrafiltration (UF) was not used in the HF population until low-impact devices were developed. Modern UF machines typically use 2 peripheral venous catheters, thus avoiding the complications of large-bore central venous access.\n\n【157】These catheters are attached to a machine with 2 pumps and a blood filter circuit. Within a minute, blood rapidly circulates through a special filter, sheds excess water and salt through aquapheresis, and then returns back to the patient. By design, UF machines are relatively easy to use, do not require intensive care unit or dialysis center monitoring, and have limited settings focused on adjusting the rate of isotonic fluid removal (which is usually restricted to a maximum of 0.5 L/h). Ultrafiltration is very effective at removing fluid, averaging 4.7 L for a single session, 7.1 L in 2 sessions, and 8.6 L during a hospitalization.\n\n【158】Ultrafiltration versus usual care for hospitalized patients with heart failure: the Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (RAPID-CHF) trial.\n\n【159】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【160】Outcomes of volume-overloaded cardiovascular patients treated with ultrafiltration.\n\n【161】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【162】Early on, several smaller studies suggested a promising future for UF.\n\n【163】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【164】Isolated ultrafiltration in moderate congestive heart failure.\n\n【165】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【166】Sustained improvement in functional capacity after removal of body fluid with isolated ultrafiltration in chronic cardiac insufficiency: failure of furosemide to provide the same result.\n\n【167】By 2005, larger trials emerged, which are summarized in Table 4 . The first study was the RAPID-CHF (Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure) trial, which randomized 40 patients with concomitant renal insufficiency to receive a single 8-hour UF session or usual care.\n\n【168】Ultrafiltration versus usual care for hospitalized patients with heart failure: the Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (RAPID-CHF) trial.\n\n【169】The UF group lost more volume (4.7 L vs 2.8 L; _P_ \\=.001) and had less dyspnea. Adding a second UF session was even more effective, with continued higher volume removal at 48 hours (8.4 L vs 5.4 L; _P_ \\=.012). Subsequently, the 200-patient UNLOAD (Ultrafiltration vs IV Diuretics for Patients Hospitalized for Acute Decompensated CHF) trial demonstrated similar results, with the UF group having greater mean ± SD weight loss (5.0±3.1 kg vs 3.1±3.5 kg; _P_ \\=.001) and water removal (4.6 L vs 3.3 L; _P_ \\=.001) at 48 hours but with no differences in dyspnea.\n\n【170】UNLOAD Trial Investigators  \nUltrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【171】By 90 days, the UF group had a mean ± SD lower risk of HF rehospitalization (0.22±0.54 vs 0.46±0.76; _P_ \\=.022) and fewer unscheduled clinic visits (21% vs 44%; _P_ \\=.009). There were no differences in renal function or mortality rates.\n\n【172】A randomized, controlled trial of the renal effects of ultrafiltration as compared to furosemide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【173】Table 4 Summary of Mechanisms of Action and Recent Evidence for UF in ADHF\n\n| Mechanisms of action | Evidence |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【175】ADHF = acute decompensated heart failure; UF = ultrafiltration.\n\n【176】Despite these promising results, the trials were criticized because the usual care groups were not aggressively treated with diuretics as most received only double their outpatient diuretic regimen. For the subset treated more aggressively, diuretic therapy was similar to UF in reducing fluid (−4.6 L vs −3.9 L) and weight (5.0 kg vs 3.6 kg).\n\n【177】UNLOAD Trial Investigators  \nUltrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【178】In response, the CARRESS-HF (Cardiorenal Rescue Study in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) trial was then performed, which randomized 188 patients with ADHF, worsened renal function (creatinine level ≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline), and persistent intravascular congestion to receive UF or diuretic therapy.\n\n【179】Ultrafiltration in decompensated heart failure with cardiorenal syndrome.\n\n【180】In contrast to previous trials, usual care patients were initially treated with high-dose loop diuretics and then received additional thiazide diuretics, inotropes, or vasodilators if urine output was inadequate. As a result, there were no differences in mean ± SD weight loss at 96 hours (5.5±5.1 kg vs 5.7±3.9 kg; _P_ \\=.58), but the UF group had more serious adverse events (72% vs 57%; _P_ \\=.03), mainly due to bleeding and catheter-related complications, and worsened mean ± SD serum creatinine levels (0.23±0.7 mg/dL vs −0.04±0.53 mg/dL; _P_ \\=.003). Aside from the use of more intensive medical therapy, the enrollment of only patients with evidence of worsened renal function (cardiorenal syndrome) in CARRESS-HF may explain the disparate results between it and the UNLOAD studies.\n\n【181】In conclusion, UF is effective in removing fluid in patients with ADHF but is associated with increased risks, mainly due to vascular access complications (vein access, bleeding, trauma, and infection). Based on the current evidence, UF is similarly efficacious to optimally dosed diuretic therapy, costs more, and requires close patient supervision. Therefore, UF should not be initially considered, although it may prove useful in diuretic-refractory patients with ADHF. Because equipoise exists regarding appropriate use of UF in ADHF, a larger, 800-patient, randomized controlled trial was undertaken, but it was terminated due to patient recruitment challenges.\n\n【182】Preventive Strategies\n---------------------\n\n【183】### Fluid and Salt Restriction\n\n【184】Neurohormonal imbalances created by HF lead to an inability to excrete sodium and water. Therefore, conventional wisdom has advised limiting the intake of both because one cannot accumulate what one does not ingest. Early studies suggested that patients with HF on high-salt diets have an inability to augment ventricular contractility, plasma natriuretic factors, and urine sodium excretion.\n\n【185】Abnormalities of sodium handling and of cardiovascular adaptations during high salt diet in patients with mild heart failure.\n\n【186】However, these responses seem to be different in patients treated with typical modern pharmacologic therapies (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists). In fact, 1 study showed that these patients have similar responses to controls when exposed to high salt loads, augmenting the cardiac index and stroke volume while decreasing peripheral vascular resistance and suppressing angiotensin II and norepinephrine levels. Moreover, continued high-salt diet exposure did not lead to ADHF.\n\n【187】Hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses to changes in sodium intake in compensated heart failure.\n\n【188】In contrast, sodium restriction led to no change in NYHA classifications but increases in aldosterone, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels.\n\n【189】Regarding clinically relevant outcomes, recent studies also contradict commonly held beliefs correlating increases in sodium intake (and, therefore, total body fluid retention and increased weight) with ADHF. In 1 study, patients presenting to the emergency department with HF did not consume more high-sodium food in the preceding 3 days.\n\n【190】In another study, most patients (∼54%) did not have a significant change in weight before developing ADHF.\n\n【191】In yet another study, which collected data from implantable hemodynamic monitoring systems in patients with HF, weight gain did not precede ADHF; instead, most had increased intracardiac filling pressures first.\n\n【192】Transition from chronic compensated to acute decompensated heart failure: pathophysiological insights obtained from continuous monitoring of intracardiac pressures.\n\n【193】Intriguingly, 2 randomized controlled trials evaluating different sodium intake diets also suggested no benefit to sodium restriction. In the first trial, recently admitted patients randomized to the less-restricted diet (2.8 g) had fewer readmissions at 180 days (8% vs 26%) and lower plasma renin, aldosterone, and BNP levels compared with patients randomized to the more sodium-restricted diet (1.8 g/d).\n\n【194】However, this trial required unusually high doses of furosemide (250-500 mg twice daily) and unrealistically limited fluid intake to 1000 mL/d. A subsequent trial by the same group randomized patients to receive 1.8 g vs 2.8 g of sodium per day and 1 L vs 2 L of fluid per day and used lower doses of furosemide (125-250 mg twice daily). Again, higher sodium intake was associated with decreased readmissions at 180 days (adjusted odds ratio of 2.46) and improved neurohormonal markers.\n\n【195】Medium term effects of different dosage of diuretic, sodium, and fluid administration on neurohormonal and clinical outcome in patients with recently compensated heart failure.\n\n【196】In contrast to the previously mentioned trials, a recent cohort study evaluated sodium intake over 6 days in 123 patients with systolic HF and found that patients in the highest tertile of sodium consumption had a higher risk of mortality and all-cause hospitalizations (combined adjusted hazard ratio of 2.55 vs the lowest tertile).\n\n【197】A high-sodium diet is associated with acute decompensated heart failure in ambulatory heart failure patients: a prospective follow-up study.\n\n【198】These patients also had higher total daily fluid intake (2.4 L vs 2 L).\n\n【199】In the inpatient setting, sodium restriction also may not be beneficial. One study randomized 75 patients with ADHF to a fluid- or sodium-restricted diet (800 mL/d or 800 mg/d, respectively) or an unrestricted diet for 3 days.\n\n【200】There were no differences in dosages of loop diuretics and no differences in length of stay, renal function, clinical congestion, body weight, or readmission rates. However, perceived thirst was significantly worse in the sodium- and fluid-restricted groups.\n\n【201】Finally, a research team evaluated combining high-dose furosemide with high-dose hypertonic saline (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% saline) in patients with diuretic-refractory ADHF, randomizing 107 patients to receive this unique therapy vs high-dose furosemide (500-1000 mg/d) therapy alone. The group receiving hypertonic saline had improved diuresis, natriuresis, and renal function, with lower readmission (47% vs 79%) and mortality (45% vs 87%) rates during the 48-month follow-up period.\n\n【202】Effects of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution infusion in comparison with a high dose of furosemide as bolus in refractory congestive heart failure: long-term effects.\n\n【203】Of note, the patients in both groups received far higher doses of intravenous furosemide (500-1000 mg/d) than is usual; thus, this trial needs to be replicated with standard diuretic treatments before endorsing hypertonic saline therapy.\n\n【204】Previously, the American Heart Association, the European Society of Cardiology, and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society had recommended sodium and water restriction in patients with HF. However, given the previously noted data and a recent Cochrane Review citing the potential for increased harm,\n\n【205】the most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines do not endorse any specific level of sodium or fluid intake in patients with stage C and D HF.\n\n【206】2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.\n\n【207】Because this is controversial,\n\n【208】well-conducted large-scale trials are needed to definitively determine the role of sodium and water in patients with HF.\n\n【209】### Monitoring Strategies\n\n【210】There is a strong interest in the early detection of ADHF because early treatment can prevent morbidity and hospitalizations.\n\n【211】Therefore, considerable research has focused on invasive and noninvasive early-warning monitoring methods.\n\n【212】#### Noninvasive Strategies\n\n【213】Telemonitoring allows for remote monitoring of weights and symptoms, ideally prompting rapid therapeutic changes in the outpatient setting. One of the earliest large randomized controlled trials to show benefit enrolled 280 outpatients with NYHA class III and IV symptoms. Clinicians were required to review proprietary home monitoring system data daily and adjust medications accordingly. Telemonitoring led to unexpectedly lower mortality rates (absolute risk reduction = 10.3%; _P_ \\=.003), although there were no differences in 6-month hospitalization rates, the primary end point.\n\n【214】Randomized trial of a daily electronic home monitoring system in patients with advanced heart failure: the Weight Monitoring in Heart Failure (WHARF) trial.\n\n【215】Subsequent well-conducted trials have not shown benefits in morbidity or mortality rates. The Tele-HF (Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes) trial used a different telemonitoring system that required patients to report daily symptoms and weights. These data were reviewed by clinicians who adjusted patients’ HF medications. Because this required considerable effort (reviewing >3 data reports per week), adherence was only 55% in the telemonitoring group, likely explaining the lack of differences in 6-month readmission or death rates.\n\n【216】Telemonitoring in patients with heart failure.\n\n【217】Another trial, the TIM-HF (Telemedical Interventional Monitoring in Heart Failure) trial, prospectively evaluated telemedical management in 710 patients with NYHA class II and III HF. Despite using a more sophisticated system, which automatically transmitted 3-lead electrocardiographic data, blood pressure, and daily weights, there were no differences in mortality or HF hospitalization rates.\n\n【218】Impact of remote telemedical management on mortality and hospitalizations in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure: the telemedical interventional monitoring in heart failure study.\n\n【219】Given the limited value of telemonitoring, manufacturers have developed alternative monitoring devices. One noninvasive device uses multiple sensors to detect changes in thoracic electrical impedance and then performs impedance cardiography (ICG) to estimate aortic blood flow and other hemodynamic parameters.\n\n【220】In the PREDICT (Prospective Evaluation of Cardiac Decompensation in Patients With Heart Failure by Impedance Cardiography Test) trial, 212 patients with HF underwent biweekly clinical assessments and ICG measurements for 26 weeks. Researchers synthesized the ICG data to develop a composite score highly predictive of clinical events in the ensuing 14 days.\n\n【221】Utility of impedance cardiography for the identification of short-term risk of clinical decompensation in stable patients with chronic heart failure.\n\n【222】Now, ICG is being further evaluated in the PREVENT-HF (Prevention of Heart Failure Events With Impedance Cardiography Testing) trial, which will determine whether ICG analysis can help prevent hospitalizations.\n\n【223】Another strategy uses the VeriCor left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) monitor (VeriCor Medical Systems), which noninvasively measures radial artery blood pressure and lung pressures during the Valsalva maneuver to estimate LVEDP.\n\n【224】Evaluation of a noninvasive system for determining left ventricular filling pressure.\n\n【225】In a recent trial, 25 hospitalized patients were randomized to treatment guided by VeriCor monitor–estimated LVEDP levels, and another 25 were treated based on clinical signs alone. The intervention group had lower LVEDPs at hospital discharge (19.7 mm Hg vs 25.6 mm Hg; _P_ \\=.01) as well as decreased rehospitalization rates (16% vs 48% at 1-year follow-up).\n\n【226】Noninvasive monitoring of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure reduces rehospitalization rates in patients hospitalized for heart failure: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【227】These results are encouraging; however, a larger randomized controlled trial is needed to fully evaluate the VeriCor system before recommending widespread use.\n\n【228】#### Invasive Monitoring\n\n【229】Compared with noninvasive devices, implantable hemodynamic monitors (IHMs) have the ability to continuously monitor real-time cardiac hemodynamics. In theory, IHM can help practitioners adjust HF medications and optimize intravascular fluid status in inpatient and outpatient settings. The first IHM device, Chronicle (Medtronic Inc), was similar to a single-lead pacemaker. Essentially, a pressure-monitoring transvenous lead was positioned in the right ventricular outflow tract that then transmitted data to a subcutaneously placed device. While promising, the COMPASS-HF (Chronicle Offers Management to Patients With Advanced Signs and Symptoms of Heart Failure) trial showed no advantage to IHM-guided therapy compared with optimal medical management.\n\n【230】Randomized controlled trial of an implantable continuous hemodynamic monitor in patients with advanced heart failure: the COMPASS-HF study.\n\n【231】A subsequent trial, REDUCEhf (Reducing Events in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure), which combined Chronicle technology with an implantable cardiac defibrillator, also showed no benefits.\n\n【232】Continuous hemodynamic monitoring in patients with mild to moderate heart failure: results of the Reducing Decompensation Events Utilizing Intracardiac Pressures in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure (REDUCEhf) trial.\n\n【233】With this combined device, there were also safety concerns because the increased complexity resulting from implanting 2 separate leads in the right ventricular led to an intolerably high risk of IHM lead failure (4% at 4 years).\n\n【234】Another means of invasive monitoring was studied in FAST (Fluid Accumulation Status Trial), a prospective, double-blind study evaluating intrathoracic impedance measurements in predicting HF events.\n\n【235】Intrathoracic impedance vs daily weight monitoring for predicting worsening heart failure events: results of the Fluid Accumulation Status Trial (FAST).\n\n【236】Patients with previously implanted cardioverter defibrillators received a software update (OptiVol; Medtronic Inc) that recorded intrathoracic impedance. The sensitivity of the software to predict HF events was superior compared with that of following changes in weight (76% vs 23%; _P_ <.001). The FAST trial prompted the DOT-HF (Diagnostic Outcome Trial in HF) trial, which randomized 335 patients with HF to receive ambulatory management based on intrathoracic impedance via OptiVol or usual care.\n\n【237】Intrathoracic impedance monitoring, audible patient alerts, and outcome in patients with heart failure.\n\n【238】No clinical benefits were observed with OptiVol-guided therapy; in fact, there were increased ambulatory visits and HF hospitalizations. Of note, this trial was terminated early owing to slow enrollment, with only 355 patients enrolled in a planned 2400-patient study.\n\n【239】In contrast to the previously mentioned IHM devices, the CardioMEMS device (St Jude Medical) is associated with clinical improvements. This device is implanted in the pulmonary artery and measures pressure waveforms in the distal pulmonary artery. In the CHAMPION-HF (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Class III Heart Failure Subjects) trial, the device was implanted in 550 patients with NYHA class III HF, who were then randomized to a treatment group, which allowed clinicians to use device data for management, or a control group.\n\n【240】Wireless pulmonary artery haemodynamic monitoring in chronic heart failure: a randomised controlled trial.\n\n【241】删除21:<u>CardioMEMS monitoring led to a 28% reduction in HF-related hospitalizations at 6 months and a 37% reduction during follow-up. The intervention group had shorter hospital stays (2.2 days vs 3.8 days) and an improved quality of life. Most importantly, the device was safe, without significant adverse events. Despite controversy about whether this trial adequately blinded CardioMEMS output in the control group, the FDA approved CardioMEMS in 2014.</u>\n\n【242】Although CardioMEMS is the only FDA-approved device, several other IHMs are currently under development. Two notable IHMs are HeartPod (St Jude Medical) and a system developed by Remon Medical Technologies. In brief, HeartPod monitors left atrial pressures and is currently being evaluated in a large randomized controlled trial.\n\n【243】In a pilot trial, 40 patients with NYHA class III or IV HF had an average reduction in left atrial pressures from 17.6 mm Hg in the first 3 months to 14.8 mm Hg; however, the study was underpowered to detect clinical differences.\n\n【244】Physician-directed patient self-management of left atrial pressure in advanced chronic heart failure.\n\n【245】The other device (Remon Medical Technologies) has shown promise in a pilot trial and is currently being evaluated in the PAPIRUS III (Monitoring Pulmonary Artery Pressure by Implantable Device Responding to Ultrasonic Signal) trial.\n\n【246】All in all, IHM devices have a promising future, and we believe that their role in managing HF will continue to evolve as more devices are studied and come to market.

Previously, clinicians relied on physiologic and pharmacologic principles to guide them in treating and preventing volume overload in these patients. However, as this review illustrates, high-quality clinical trials have provided evidence to guide clinicians in the day-to-day treatment of patients with ADHF. Intriguing small studies have hinted that perhaps not all loop diuretics are created equal and call for larger rigorous clinical trials. Large, well-conducted clinical trials evaluating nesiritide and dopamine suggest that neither drug has a major role in ADHF management. Ultrafiltration remains a promising modality for fluid removal for diuretic-refractory patients, but clinical studies do not suggest benefit for most patients compared with optimal diuretic therapy. The age-old principle of sodium restriction has been called into question by observational and clinical studies, and further prospective investigation is required. Finally, we are at the dawn of the era of invasive hemodynamic monitoring for HF management. However, as we evaluate this exciting new technology, we must remember that it is our duty to ensure that it meets the same standard we require of all other therapies: sound clinical evidence suggesting benefit in treating or preventing volume overload in patients with HF.", "index": 3430, "show": true, "start": 3404, "end": 3637, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【241】删除21:CardioMEMS monitoring led to a 28% reduction in HF-related hospitalizations at 6 months and a 37% reduction during follow-up.

As a result, neurohormonal pathways are up-regulated, including the sympathetic nervous system, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and vasopressin (or antidiuretic hormone) axis. Temporarily, mean arterial pressure and cardiac output increase to levels adequate for tissue perfusion; however, chronic neurohormonal activation is eventually deleterious, leading to salt and water retention and subsequent worsening of cardiac output.\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】Ultimately, excessive activation manifests with the familiar signs and symptoms of volume overload—the leading cause of ADHF hospitalizations.\n\n【26】In this review, we focus on treatments to remove excess fluid and prevent its accumulation in patients with HF, emphasizing recent clinical trials. All the references cited in this review have been obtained through PubMed using the following key words: _heart failure and volume overload, congestion, loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics, aldosterone antagonists, dopamine, cardiorenal syndrome, nesiritide, vasopressin antagonists, ultrafiltration, sodium restriction, fluid restriction, telemonitoring_ , and _invasive hemodynamic monitoring_ . We also reviewed relevant references cited in the obtained articles, especially articles addressing methods of treating or preventing volume overload in patients with HF.\n\n【27】Strategies for Fluid Removal\n----------------------------\n\n【28】### Diuretic Therapy\n\n【29】Diuretics are the mainstay of therapy in patients with congestive HF. Loop diuretics, which inhibit the Na-K-2Cl transport symporter, leading to decreased sodium absorption in the thick ascending loop of Henle, are most commonly used. If loop diuretics are not sufficient, additional synergistic diuretics that affect either the NaCl cotransporter (thiazides) or the renal mineralocorticoid receptor (aldosterone antagonists) are used.\n\n【30】#### Loop Diuretics\n\n【31】Loop diuretics, which include furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, and ethacrynic acid, are all generic. In the United States, furosemide was introduced much earlier than bumetanide and torsemide and is most commonly used. As a result, 87% of inpatients with ADHF are treated with furosemide, 3% with bumetanide, 0.4% with torsemide, and 10% with a combination of synergistic diuretics.\n\n【32】Dominance of furosemide for loop diuretic therapy in heart failure: time to revisit the alternatives?\n\n【33】Comparatively, loop diuretics are structurally similar, except for ethacrynic acid, which lacks a sulfa moiety. However, it is associated with a greater risk of ototoxicity, relegating its use to patients with allergies to sulfa-containing medications.\n\n【34】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【35】The other loop diuretics do have important differences in their pharmacokinetics .

In an open-label trial, 234 hospitalized patients with ADHF were randomized to receive either furosemide or torsemide and continued the same diuretic treatment for 1 year. Despite being a sicker group (ie, more previous admissions for ADHF), the torsemide group had lower ADHF readmission rates (17% vs 32%) and spent fewer days in the hospital (106 vs 296 total days). In addition, the torsemide group had less fatigue but had no change in dyspnea.\n\n【54】Open-label randomized trial of torsemide compared with furosemide therapy for patients with heart failure.\n\n【55】In the outpatient setting, torsemide was examined in the TORIC (Torasemide in Congestive Heart Failure) study, a nonrandomized, open-label, postmarketing, 1-year surveillance trial of 1377 patients that noted decreased overall mortality rates with torsemide use (2.2%) compared with other loop diuretic use (4.5%).\n\n【56】Forty-six percent of torsemide-treated patients also had improvements in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class compared with 37.2% with other diuretic treatments. Finally, adverse electrolyte changes were less, with 3% of the torsemide group requiring potassium supplementation compared with 30% with other diuretics. Because this was a retrospective, nonrandomized study, a prospective, randomized, unblinded study was subsequently performed in 237 outpatients. Compared with furosemide, torsemide improved symptoms (40.2% vs 30.7% improved NYHA class); however, there were no differences in hospitalization or mortality rates.\n\n【57】In addition to the 4 “classic” loop diuretics, there is another, azosemide, with a longer duration of action. Theoretically, azosemide leads to decreased “rebound” activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system compared with shorter-acting diuretics. Clinically, 1 trial showed benefit in 320 patients with HF who were randomized to receive 2 years of treatment with 30 to 60 mg of azosemide vs 20 to 40 mg of daily furosemide, resulting in decreased HF hospitalization rates (hazard ratio, 0.53; _P_ \\=.04), with no change in overall mortality rates.\n\n【58】Superiority of long-acting to short-acting loop diuretics in the treatment of congestive heart failure.\n\n【59】This drug needs more study and is not currently available in the United States.\n\n【60】There remains a paucity of high-quality, double-blind, randomized controlled trial data despite the widespread use of loop diuretics. Comparative trials are urgently needed, especially for furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide, and azosemide. In the meantime, we suggest that the available evidence favors torsemide use.\n\n【61】With any loop diuretic, clinicians treating inpatients with ADHF must also decide on a method for intravenous administration—either continuous infusion or intermittent boluses. Compared with intermittent boluses, continuous delivery theoretically leads to lower peak concentrations, less renal dysfunction and neurohormonal activation, and decreased “rebound” sodium and water retention. However, few studies compared the 2 methods until the DOSE (Diuretic Strategies in Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) trial was published in 2011. This trial was a prospective, double-blind trial randomizing 300 patients to receive either continuous vs bolus furosemide therapy and high- vs low-dose furosemide strategies.\n\n【62】Diuretic strategies in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【63】There were no differences in symptoms, creatinine levels, cystatin C levels, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) levels, likelihood of a switch to oral diuretics at 48 hours, or hospital length of stay in the continuous and bolus arms. At 72 hours, patients treated with the high-dose strategy had more fluid loss (4899 mL vs 3575 mL; _P_ \\=.001) and weight loss, improved dyspnea scores ( _P_ \\=.04), and a trend toward greater reduction in NT-pro-BNP levels (−1822 pg/mL vs −1194 pg/mL; _P_ \\=.06). However, there were no differences in hospital length of stay, mortality, or 60-day readmission rates, and a greater proportion had an increase in creatinine concentration by more than 0.3 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4) (23% vs 14%; _P_ \\=.04). Given the overall results of this well-conducted trial, there is no added benefit to routine continuous intravenous infusions over bolus administration of loop diuretics in the treatment of ADHF.\n\n【64】#### Thiazide Diuretics\n\n【65】Thiazide diuretics are typically used for hypertension treatment,\n\n【66】2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8).\n\n【67】but they also can modestly affect volume removal. When added to a loop diuretic, the combination potentiates diuresis due to sequential receptor blockade in the ascending loop of Henle and the distal nephron.\n\n【68】Thiazides are especially useful in patients with long-term loop diuretic use because they help overcome the decreased loop diuretic response caused by hypertrophy of the loop of Henle and distal convoluted tubule.\n\n【69】Despite these well-known observations, studies supporting combination therapy include few patients and do not compare different therapy combinations.\n\n【70】Oral metolazone plus furosemide for home therapy in patients with refractory heart failure.\n\n【71】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【72】Clinically, combination therapy can cause profound electrolyte abnormalities, especially hypokalemia, which requires close monitoring in the inpatient and outpatient settings.\n\n【73】Although there are no comparative data among the thiazide diuretics, metolazone and chlorothiazide tend to be favored, although hydrocholorothiazide and chlorthalidone can also be considered. We recommend metolazone, which should be administered infrequently (ie, 2.5-5 mg every 48 hours) owing to its long half-life. For patients who cannot take oral medications, we favor chlorothiazide (250-500 mg twice daily), which is available in a more expensive intravenous formulation.\n\n【74】#### Aldosterone Antagonists\n\n【75】Table 2 summarizes the data for spironolactone, a nonselective mineralocorticoid receptor blocker, and eplerenone, a newer medication with minimal effects on sex steroid receptors.\n\n【76】Eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after myocardial infarction.\n\n【77】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【78】The effect of spironolactone on morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure: Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study Investigators.\n\n【79】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【80】Eplerenone in patients with systolic heart failure and mild symptoms.\n\n【81】In select patients, low-dose therapy decreases morbidity and mortality when added to standard HF medications owing to cardiac antifibrotic effects and beneficial cardiac remodeling.\n\n【82】Randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of aldosterone antagonism with eplerenone on ventricular remodeling in patients with mild-to-moderate heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction.\n\n【83】Furthermore, higher-dose therapy leads to diuresis by blocking renal salt-retaining aldosterone receptors.\n\n【84】In contrast to low-dose therapy, high-dose therapy was evaluated in only 1 trial, which enrolled 100 patients with ADHF to receive either placebo or 50 to 100 mg of spironolactone. By the third day, treatment was associated with decreased edema, orthopnea, and NT-pro-BNP levels (2488 pg/mL vs 1555 pg/mL).\n\n【85】However, there were no differences in length of stay, and renal function worsened (20% in the spironolactone group had a ≥0.3 mg/dL rise in serum creatinine concentration compared with 4%), with no differences in serum potassium levels. Despite being the largest trial of its kind, this was a small study conducted at a single center in Portugal; the assessing physicians were not blinded to the treatment, and patient assignments were not randomized. Therefore, these results call for a definitive, larger, randomized controlled trial.\n\n【86】Table 2 Aldosterone Antagonist Comparison\n\n【87】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【88】AMI = acute myocardial infarction; CHF = congestive heart failure; EF = ejection fraction; HR = hazard ratio; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SCD = sudden cardiac death.\n\n【89】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【90】SI conversion factor: To convert creatinine values to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4.\n\n| Characteristic | Spironolactone | Eplerenone | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n【92】a AMI = acute myocardial infarction; CHF = congestive heart failure; EF = ejection fraction; HR = hazard ratio; NYHA = New York Heart Association; SCD = sudden cardiac death.\n\n【93】b SI conversion factor: To convert creatinine values to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4.\n\n【94】c Caution: estimated glomerular filtration rates less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> or potassium levels of 5.0 mmol/L or greater.\n\n【95】#### Vasopressin Antagonists\n\n【96】Solute-free water diuretics, or aquaretics, work via vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) antagonism and include lixivaptan, tolvaptan, and conivaptan. Although they are mostly used to correct hyponatremia, they have also been evaluated for ADHF treatment owing to their diuretic properties. For tolvaptan, it was first clinically evaluated in the ACTIV in CHF (Acute and Chronic Therapeutic Impact of a Vasopressin Antagonist in Congestive Heart Failure) study, in which 319 hospitalized patients with persistent congestive ADHF were randomized to receive tolvaptan (either 30, 60, or 90 mg/d) or placebo in addition to standard HF therapy. In the first 24 hours, there was a trend toward greater weight loss in the tolvaptan groups ( _P_ <.08 for all groups vs placebo) and increased serum sodium levels, with no adverse changes in potassium levels or renal function.\n\n【97】Improvement in hyponatremia during hospitalization for worsening heart failure is associated with improved outcomes: insights from the Acute and Chronic Therapeutic Impact of a Vasopressin Antagonist in Chronic Heart Failure (ACTIV in CHF) trial.\n\n【98】Subsequently, the much larger, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4133-patient EVEREST (Efficacy of Vasopressin Antagonism in Heart Failure Outcome Study With Tolvaptan) trial revealed a benefit with tolvaptan therapy, leading to significant weight reduction and improved dyspnea scores in the first 24 hours, as well as decreasing edema by day 7.\n\n【99】Clinical course of patients with hyponatremia and decompensated systolic heart failure and the effect of vasopressin receptor antagonism with tolvaptan.\n\n【100】Despite the short-term benefits, there were no long-term differences in all-cause mortality or hospitalizations at median follow-up of almost 10 months.\n\n【101】Similar to tolvaptan, lixivaptan has shown potential benefit in diuresis. In 1 study, 42 patients with mild-to-moderate HF were randomized to receive either placebo or 1 of 6 different doses of lixivaptan. There were significant and dose-related increases in urine volume at 24 hours, with the highest lixivaptan dose (400 mg) yielding an average of 3.9 L of urine output compared with 1.8 L with placebo ( _P_ <.01).\n\n【102】Because there are no large-scale trials, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not yet approved lixivaptan and is awaiting data from the BALANCE (Treatment of Hyponatremia Based on Lixivaptan in NYHA Class III/IV Cardiac Patient Evaluation) trial, which aims to enroll 650 patients with ADHF and a serum sodium level less than 135 mEq/L (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 1.0).\n\n【103】Rationale and design of the treatment of hyponatremia based on lixivaptan in NYHA class III/IV cardiac patient evaluation (THE BALANCE) study.\n\n【104】Compared with other “vaptans,” conivaptan is unique because it is administered intravenously. Although there are no large studies, conivaptan can improve diuresis when added to loop diuretics. A pilot study in 170 hospitalized patients with worsening ADHF were randomized to receive conivaptan (loading dose plus 2 successive infusions of 40, 80, or 120 mg/d) or placebo in addition to standard loop diuretic therapy. At each dose range, initial urine output was significantly increased at 24 and 48 hours.\n\n【105】However, many patients had infusion-site phlebitis (17.5%-33%, depending on the dose), but there were no other adverse effects, such as changes in vital signs, electrolyte levels, or cardiac rhythms.\n\n【106】In summary, although vaptans may help in the short-term in patients with ADHF and hyponatremia, current studies suggest that they do not decrease mortality rates or have long-term benefits. If used, patients require close monitoring because antidiuretic hormone antagonists can lead to rapid increases in sodium levels.\n\n【107】### Dopamine\n\n【108】Intravenous dopamine induces natriuresis and diuresis by increasing renal vasodilatation and blood flow through activation of renal-specific dopamine (DA) DA <sub>1 </sub> and DA <sub>2 </sub> receptors\n\n【109】Dopamine-1 and dopamine-2 mechanisms in the control of renal function.\n\n【110】and inhibition of proximal tubular Na <sup>+ </sup> /H <sup>+ </sup> and Na <sup>+ </sup> K <sup>+ </sup> ATPase pumps.\n\n【111】Dopamine purportedly selectively activates receptors in a dose-dependent manner, with low doses (2-5 μg/kg per minute) predominantly affecting DA <sub>1 </sub> and DA <sub>2 </sub> receptors and higher doses activating β and then α vasoreceptors.\n\n【112】Dopamine-1 and dopamine-2 mechanisms in the control of renal function.\n\n【113】This physiologic finding inspired the concept of using low-dose (“renal-dose”) dopamine to enhance diuresis in ADHF; however, this strategy has been clinically disappointing. Multiple systematic reviews have noted no meaningful benefits with low-dose dopamine therapy.\n\n【114】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【115】A 2005 meta-analysis of 61 trials encompassing 3259 patients showed no differences in mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, or adverse events. In this study, urine output increased 24% in the first 24 hours.\n\n【116】Because only 1 small study included in these reviews specifically included patients with HF,\n\n【117】3 studies were conducted evaluating low-dose dopamine for ADHF treatment. A retrospective study assessed 116 patients receiving furosemide by continuous infusion coupled with low-dose dopamine or bolus intravenous furosemide alone.\n\n【118】Continuous infusion of furosemide combined with low-dose dopamine compared to intermittent boluses in acutely decompensated heart failure is less nephrotoxic and carries a lower readmission at thirty days.\n\n【119】The patients in the dopamine/continuous furosemide arm had improved renal function, greater diuresis, fewer inpatient hospital days, and reduced 30-day readmission rates. However, the 2 groups had significantly different baseline characteristics, including worse renal function and a higher rate of aldosterone antagonist treatment in the dopamine group. The subsequent DAD-HF (Dopamine in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) study was the first to prospectively randomize patients with ADHF to receive either high-dose intravenous furosemide (20 mg/h) or low-dose intravenous furosemide (5 mg/h) coupled with 8 hours of low-dose dopamine (5 μg/kg per minute).\n\n【120】Impact of dopamine infusion on renal function in hospitalized heart failure patients: results of the Dopamine in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure (DAD-HF) Trial.\n\n【121】There were no differences in diuresis, dyspnea scores, inpatient hospital days, mortality rates, renal function, or rehospitalization rates in the 60 patients enrolled in the study. Three years later, the ROSE-AHF (Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure) trial supplanted DAD-HF as the largest randomized trial of low-dose dopamine in the HF population.\n\n【122】Low-dose dopamine or low-dose nesiritide in acute heart failure with renal dysfunction: the ROSE acute heart failure randomized trial.\n\n【123】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【124】Targeting the kidney in acute heart failure: can old drugs provide new benefit? Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (ROSE AHF) trial.\n\n【125】In this trial, 360 patients with ADHF and renal dysfunction were randomized to receive diuretics with placebo, low-dose dopamine (2 μg/kg per minute), or low-dose nesiritide for 72 hours. Compared with DAD-HF, ROSE-AHF used dopamine for longer (although at a lower dose), had no variations in diuretic dosing between the groups, and had a much larger study size. In the end, dopamine therapy did not affect urine output or renal function and at 60 days led to no differences in mortality or unscheduled outpatient or inpatient HF-related appointments.\n\n【126】Based on the previously mentioned trials, dopamine’s effect of renal vasodilation has not led to clinical benefits, perhaps due to variability in pharmacologic levels and heterogeneous responses to dopamine. Even in healthy individuals, a stable infusion dose of 3 μg/kg per minute of dopamine leads to unreliable dopamine plasma concentrations, varying between 1800 and 18,300 ng/L.\n\n【127】In patients with renal failure, dopamine’s renal vasodilatory effects are blunted and instead paradoxically increase renal resistance indices.\n\n【128】Similarly, patients with ADHF have reduced effects with dopamine infusion, requiring much higher–than-expected doses (4-6 μg/kg per minute) to augment peak renal blood flow and reduce renal vascular resistance. Furthermore, the sickest patients (NYHA class IV) have no dopamine-associated changes in renal vascular resistance or the fraction of cardiac output dedicated to renal perfusion.\n\n【129】Renal, but not systemic, hemodynamic effects of dopamine are influenced by the severity of congestive heart failure.\n\n【130】Therefore, dopamine’s pharmacologic effects seem least effective in patients with severe ADHF or renal failure, likely at least partly explaining the observed lack of clinical benefit.\n\n【131】As summarized in Table 3 , the routine use of dopamine for augmented diuresis or renal protection is not supported by recent studies. In patients with HF and reduced ejection fraction, it is reasonable to use dopamine only transiently to increase blood pressure and cardiac output.\n\n【132】### Nesiritide\n\n【133】The effects of BNP seem perfectly tailored to therapeutic exploitation: augmented natriuresis, sympatholysis, antiproliferative effects, and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition. Based on 2 trials showing a reduction in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and improvement in dyspnea after 3 hours of therapy,\n\n【134】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【135】Intravenous nesiritide, a natriuretic peptide, in the treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure.\n\n【136】synthetic BNP (nesiritide) was approved by the FDA in 2001 for clinical use.\n\n【137】A year later, the PRECEDENT (Prospective Randomized Evaluation of Cardiac Ectopy With Dobutamine or Nesiritide Therapy) trial was published, which showed symptomatic improvements with nesiritide compared with dobutamine, with lower rates of ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n【138】Effect of nesiritide (b-type natriuretic peptide) and dobutamine on ventricular arrhythmias in the treatment of patients with acutely decompensated congestive heart failure: the PRECEDENT study.\n\n【139】By 2004, nesiritide was in widespread use in various off-label clinical settings despite the lack of documented clinical benefits. These settings included prolonged infusions in patients awaiting heart transplants, 1-time doses given as first-line therapy for ADHF in the emergency department, and intermittent, scheduled injections in outpatient infusion clinics in patients with chronic HF.\n\n【140】However, 2 meta-analyses published in 2005 noted increased renal failure, hypotension, and mortality rates in patients treated with nesiritide, prompting further studies.\n\n【141】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【142】The first subsequent randomized study, the FUSION II (Second Follow-up Serial Infusions of Nesiritide) trial, showed no clinical benefits with serial outpatient nesiritide infusions.\n\n【143】Safety and efficacy of outpatient nesiritide in patients with advanced heart failure: results of the Second Follow-Up Serial Infusions of Nesiritide (FUSION II) trial.\n\n【144】Then, 2 large-scale trials evaluated inpatient nesiritide therapy. The first, the ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure) trial, randomized 7141 patients to receive nesiritide (0.01 μg/kg per minute for at least 24 hours and up to 7 days) or placebo therapy.\n\n【145】effect of nesiritide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【146】There were no significant improvements in self-reported dyspnea rates at 6 and 24 hours and no differences in death or HF hospitalization rates.\n\n【147】Effects of nesiritide and predictors of urine output in acute decompensated heart failure: results from ASCEND-HF (Acute Study of Clinical Effectiveness of Nesiritide and Decompensated Heart Failure).\n\n【148】However, nesiritide use led to more adverse events, especially hypotension (26.6% vs 15.3%; _P_ ≤.001). The second trial, the previously mentioned ROSE-AHF study,\n\n【149】Targeting the kidney in acute heart failure: can old drugs provide new benefit? Renal Optimization Strategies Evaluation in Acute Heart Failure (ROSE AHF) trial.\n\n【150】specifically targeted patients with ADHF and renal failure. Compared with placebo use, low-dose (0.005 μg/kg per minute) nesiritide therapy was not associated with improvements in urine output, renal function, symptoms, mortality rates, or rehospitalization rates. In addition, nesiritide therapy led to higher symptomatic hypotension rates.\n\n【151】Although there may remain a yet-undiscovered niche use, the ASCEND-HF and ROSE-AHF trials indicate no current role for nesiritide in augmenting urine output or renal function in patients with ADHF. Nesiritide should be used only after proven treatment strategies have not improved symptoms (and then only in select inpatients who are not hypotensive or in cardiogenic shock), and expectations for therapeutic success should be tempered by knowledge of these recent negative clinical studies. Table 3 summarizes the pharmacologic properties of nesiritide and the relevant clinical trials.\n\n【152】Table 3 Summary of Mechanisms of Action and Recent Evidence for Dopamine and Nesiritide in ADHF\n\n| Therapy | Mechanisms of action | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【154】ADHF = acute decompensated heart failure; PCWP = pulmonary capillary wedge pressure; RAAS = renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.\n\n【155】### Ultrafiltration\n\n【156】Although first considered in 1908, venovenous ultrafiltration (UF) was not used in the HF population until low-impact devices were developed. Modern UF machines typically use 2 peripheral venous catheters, thus avoiding the complications of large-bore central venous access.\n\n【157】These catheters are attached to a machine with 2 pumps and a blood filter circuit. Within a minute, blood rapidly circulates through a special filter, sheds excess water and salt through aquapheresis, and then returns back to the patient. By design, UF machines are relatively easy to use, do not require intensive care unit or dialysis center monitoring, and have limited settings focused on adjusting the rate of isotonic fluid removal (which is usually restricted to a maximum of 0.5 L/h). Ultrafiltration is very effective at removing fluid, averaging 4.7 L for a single session, 7.1 L in 2 sessions, and 8.6 L during a hospitalization.\n\n【158】Ultrafiltration versus usual care for hospitalized patients with heart failure: the Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (RAPID-CHF) trial.\n\n【159】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【160】Outcomes of volume-overloaded cardiovascular patients treated with ultrafiltration.\n\n【161】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【162】Early on, several smaller studies suggested a promising future for UF.\n\n【163】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【164】Isolated ultrafiltration in moderate congestive heart failure.\n\n【165】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【166】Sustained improvement in functional capacity after removal of body fluid with isolated ultrafiltration in chronic cardiac insufficiency: failure of furosemide to provide the same result.\n\n【167】By 2005, larger trials emerged, which are summarized in Table 4 . The first study was the RAPID-CHF (Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure) trial, which randomized 40 patients with concomitant renal insufficiency to receive a single 8-hour UF session or usual care.\n\n【168】Ultrafiltration versus usual care for hospitalized patients with heart failure: the Relief for Acutely Fluid-Overloaded Patients With Decompensated Congestive Heart Failure (RAPID-CHF) trial.\n\n【169】The UF group lost more volume (4.7 L vs 2.8 L; _P_ \\=.001) and had less dyspnea. Adding a second UF session was even more effective, with continued higher volume removal at 48 hours (8.4 L vs 5.4 L; _P_ \\=.012). Subsequently, the 200-patient UNLOAD (Ultrafiltration vs IV Diuretics for Patients Hospitalized for Acute Decompensated CHF) trial demonstrated similar results, with the UF group having greater mean ± SD weight loss (5.0±3.1 kg vs 3.1±3.5 kg; _P_ \\=.001) and water removal (4.6 L vs 3.3 L; _P_ \\=.001) at 48 hours but with no differences in dyspnea.\n\n【170】UNLOAD Trial Investigators  \nUltrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【171】By 90 days, the UF group had a mean ± SD lower risk of HF rehospitalization (0.22±0.54 vs 0.46±0.76; _P_ \\=.022) and fewer unscheduled clinic visits (21% vs 44%; _P_ \\=.009). There were no differences in renal function or mortality rates.\n\n【172】A randomized, controlled trial of the renal effects of ultrafiltration as compared to furosemide in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【173】Table 4 Summary of Mechanisms of Action and Recent Evidence for UF in ADHF\n\n| Mechanisms of action | Evidence |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【175】ADHF = acute decompensated heart failure; UF = ultrafiltration.\n\n【176】Despite these promising results, the trials were criticized because the usual care groups were not aggressively treated with diuretics as most received only double their outpatient diuretic regimen. For the subset treated more aggressively, diuretic therapy was similar to UF in reducing fluid (−4.6 L vs −3.9 L) and weight (5.0 kg vs 3.6 kg).\n\n【177】UNLOAD Trial Investigators  \nUltrafiltration versus intravenous diuretics for patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure.\n\n【178】In response, the CARRESS-HF (Cardiorenal Rescue Study in Acute Decompensated Heart Failure) trial was then performed, which randomized 188 patients with ADHF, worsened renal function (creatinine level ≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline), and persistent intravascular congestion to receive UF or diuretic therapy.\n\n【179】Ultrafiltration in decompensated heart failure with cardiorenal syndrome.\n\n【180】In contrast to previous trials, usual care patients were initially treated with high-dose loop diuretics and then received additional thiazide diuretics, inotropes, or vasodilators if urine output was inadequate. As a result, there were no differences in mean ± SD weight loss at 96 hours (5.5±5.1 kg vs 5.7±3.9 kg; _P_ \\=.58), but the UF group had more serious adverse events (72% vs 57%; _P_ \\=.03), mainly due to bleeding and catheter-related complications, and worsened mean ± SD serum creatinine levels (0.23±0.7 mg/dL vs −0.04±0.53 mg/dL; _P_ \\=.003). Aside from the use of more intensive medical therapy, the enrollment of only patients with evidence of worsened renal function (cardiorenal syndrome) in CARRESS-HF may explain the disparate results between it and the UNLOAD studies.\n\n【181】In conclusion, UF is effective in removing fluid in patients with ADHF but is associated with increased risks, mainly due to vascular access complications (vein access, bleeding, trauma, and infection). Based on the current evidence, UF is similarly efficacious to optimally dosed diuretic therapy, costs more, and requires close patient supervision. Therefore, UF should not be initially considered, although it may prove useful in diuretic-refractory patients with ADHF. Because equipoise exists regarding appropriate use of UF in ADHF, a larger, 800-patient, randomized controlled trial was undertaken, but it was terminated due to patient recruitment challenges.\n\n【182】Preventive Strategies\n---------------------\n\n【183】### Fluid and Salt Restriction\n\n【184】Neurohormonal imbalances created by HF lead to an inability to excrete sodium and water. Therefore, conventional wisdom has advised limiting the intake of both because one cannot accumulate what one does not ingest. Early studies suggested that patients with HF on high-salt diets have an inability to augment ventricular contractility, plasma natriuretic factors, and urine sodium excretion.\n\n【185】Abnormalities of sodium handling and of cardiovascular adaptations during high salt diet in patients with mild heart failure.\n\n【186】However, these responses seem to be different in patients treated with typical modern pharmacologic therapies (ie, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, beta-blockers, and aldosterone antagonists). In fact, 1 study showed that these patients have similar responses to controls when exposed to high salt loads, augmenting the cardiac index and stroke volume while decreasing peripheral vascular resistance and suppressing angiotensin II and norepinephrine levels. Moreover, continued high-salt diet exposure did not lead to ADHF.\n\n【187】Hemodynamic and neuroendocrine responses to changes in sodium intake in compensated heart failure.\n\n【188】In contrast, sodium restriction led to no change in NYHA classifications but increases in aldosterone, norepinephrine, and dopamine levels.\n\n【189】Regarding clinically relevant outcomes, recent studies also contradict commonly held beliefs correlating increases in sodium intake (and, therefore, total body fluid retention and increased weight) with ADHF. In 1 study, patients presenting to the emergency department with HF did not consume more high-sodium food in the preceding 3 days.\n\n【190】In another study, most patients (∼54%) did not have a significant change in weight before developing ADHF.\n\n【191】In yet another study, which collected data from implantable hemodynamic monitoring systems in patients with HF, weight gain did not precede ADHF; instead, most had increased intracardiac filling pressures first.\n\n【192】Transition from chronic compensated to acute decompensated heart failure: pathophysiological insights obtained from continuous monitoring of intracardiac pressures.\n\n【193】Intriguingly, 2 randomized controlled trials evaluating different sodium intake diets also suggested no benefit to sodium restriction. In the first trial, recently admitted patients randomized to the less-restricted diet (2.8 g) had fewer readmissions at 180 days (8% vs 26%) and lower plasma renin, aldosterone, and BNP levels compared with patients randomized to the more sodium-restricted diet (1.8 g/d).\n\n【194】However, this trial required unusually high doses of furosemide (250-500 mg twice daily) and unrealistically limited fluid intake to 1000 mL/d. A subsequent trial by the same group randomized patients to receive 1.8 g vs 2.8 g of sodium per day and 1 L vs 2 L of fluid per day and used lower doses of furosemide (125-250 mg twice daily). Again, higher sodium intake was associated with decreased readmissions at 180 days (adjusted odds ratio of 2.46) and improved neurohormonal markers.\n\n【195】Medium term effects of different dosage of diuretic, sodium, and fluid administration on neurohormonal and clinical outcome in patients with recently compensated heart failure.\n\n【196】In contrast to the previously mentioned trials, a recent cohort study evaluated sodium intake over 6 days in 123 patients with systolic HF and found that patients in the highest tertile of sodium consumption had a higher risk of mortality and all-cause hospitalizations (combined adjusted hazard ratio of 2.55 vs the lowest tertile).\n\n【197】A high-sodium diet is associated with acute decompensated heart failure in ambulatory heart failure patients: a prospective follow-up study.\n\n【198】These patients also had higher total daily fluid intake (2.4 L vs 2 L).\n\n【199】In the inpatient setting, sodium restriction also may not be beneficial. One study randomized 75 patients with ADHF to a fluid- or sodium-restricted diet (800 mL/d or 800 mg/d, respectively) or an unrestricted diet for 3 days.\n\n【200】There were no differences in dosages of loop diuretics and no differences in length of stay, renal function, clinical congestion, body weight, or readmission rates. However, perceived thirst was significantly worse in the sodium- and fluid-restricted groups.\n\n【201】Finally, a research team evaluated combining high-dose furosemide with high-dose hypertonic saline (150 mL of 1.4%-4.6% saline) in patients with diuretic-refractory ADHF, randomizing 107 patients to receive this unique therapy vs high-dose furosemide (500-1000 mg/d) therapy alone. The group receiving hypertonic saline had improved diuresis, natriuresis, and renal function, with lower readmission (47% vs 79%) and mortality (45% vs 87%) rates during the 48-month follow-up period.\n\n【202】Effects of high-dose furosemide and small-volume hypertonic saline solution infusion in comparison with a high dose of furosemide as bolus in refractory congestive heart failure: long-term effects.\n\n【203】Of note, the patients in both groups received far higher doses of intravenous furosemide (500-1000 mg/d) than is usual; thus, this trial needs to be replicated with standard diuretic treatments before endorsing hypertonic saline therapy.\n\n【204】Previously, the American Heart Association, the European Society of Cardiology, and the Canadian Cardiovascular Society had recommended sodium and water restriction in patients with HF. However, given the previously noted data and a recent Cochrane Review citing the potential for increased harm,\n\n【205】the most recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines do not endorse any specific level of sodium or fluid intake in patients with stage C and D HF.\n\n【206】2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure: a report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines.\n\n【207】Because this is controversial,\n\n【208】well-conducted large-scale trials are needed to definitively determine the role of sodium and water in patients with HF.\n\n【209】### Monitoring Strategies\n\n【210】There is a strong interest in the early detection of ADHF because early treatment can prevent morbidity and hospitalizations.\n\n【211】Therefore, considerable research has focused on invasive and noninvasive early-warning monitoring methods.\n\n【212】#### Noninvasive Strategies\n\n【213】Telemonitoring allows for remote monitoring of weights and symptoms, ideally prompting rapid therapeutic changes in the outpatient setting. One of the earliest large randomized controlled trials to show benefit enrolled 280 outpatients with NYHA class III and IV symptoms. Clinicians were required to review proprietary home monitoring system data daily and adjust medications accordingly. Telemonitoring led to unexpectedly lower mortality rates (absolute risk reduction = 10.3%; _P_ \\=.003), although there were no differences in 6-month hospitalization rates, the primary end point.\n\n【214】Randomized trial of a daily electronic home monitoring system in patients with advanced heart failure: the Weight Monitoring in Heart Failure (WHARF) trial.\n\n【215】Subsequent well-conducted trials have not shown benefits in morbidity or mortality rates. The Tele-HF (Telemonitoring to Improve Heart Failure Outcomes) trial used a different telemonitoring system that required patients to report daily symptoms and weights. These data were reviewed by clinicians who adjusted patients’ HF medications. Because this required considerable effort (reviewing >3 data reports per week), adherence was only 55% in the telemonitoring group, likely explaining the lack of differences in 6-month readmission or death rates.\n\n【216】Telemonitoring in patients with heart failure.\n\n【217】Another trial, the TIM-HF (Telemedical Interventional Monitoring in Heart Failure) trial, prospectively evaluated telemedical management in 710 patients with NYHA class II and III HF. Despite using a more sophisticated system, which automatically transmitted 3-lead electrocardiographic data, blood pressure, and daily weights, there were no differences in mortality or HF hospitalization rates.\n\n【218】Impact of remote telemedical management on mortality and hospitalizations in ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure: the telemedical interventional monitoring in heart failure study.\n\n【219】Given the limited value of telemonitoring, manufacturers have developed alternative monitoring devices. One noninvasive device uses multiple sensors to detect changes in thoracic electrical impedance and then performs impedance cardiography (ICG) to estimate aortic blood flow and other hemodynamic parameters.\n\n【220】In the PREDICT (Prospective Evaluation of Cardiac Decompensation in Patients With Heart Failure by Impedance Cardiography Test) trial, 212 patients with HF underwent biweekly clinical assessments and ICG measurements for 26 weeks. Researchers synthesized the ICG data to develop a composite score highly predictive of clinical events in the ensuing 14 days.\n\n【221】Utility of impedance cardiography for the identification of short-term risk of clinical decompensation in stable patients with chronic heart failure.\n\n【222】Now, ICG is being further evaluated in the PREVENT-HF (Prevention of Heart Failure Events With Impedance Cardiography Testing) trial, which will determine whether ICG analysis can help prevent hospitalizations.\n\n【223】Another strategy uses the VeriCor left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) monitor (VeriCor Medical Systems), which noninvasively measures radial artery blood pressure and lung pressures during the Valsalva maneuver to estimate LVEDP.\n\n【224】Evaluation of a noninvasive system for determining left ventricular filling pressure.\n\n【225】In a recent trial, 25 hospitalized patients were randomized to treatment guided by VeriCor monitor–estimated LVEDP levels, and another 25 were treated based on clinical signs alone. The intervention group had lower LVEDPs at hospital discharge (19.7 mm Hg vs 25.6 mm Hg; _P_ \\=.01) as well as decreased rehospitalization rates (16% vs 48% at 1-year follow-up).\n\n【226】Noninvasive monitoring of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure reduces rehospitalization rates in patients hospitalized for heart failure: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【227】These results are encouraging; however, a larger randomized controlled trial is needed to fully evaluate the VeriCor system before recommending widespread use.\n\n【228】#### Invasive Monitoring\n\n【229】Compared with noninvasive devices, implantable hemodynamic monitors (IHMs) have the ability to continuously monitor real-time cardiac hemodynamics. In theory, IHM can help practitioners adjust HF medications and optimize intravascular fluid status in inpatient and outpatient settings. The first IHM device, Chronicle (Medtronic Inc), was similar to a single-lead pacemaker. Essentially, a pressure-monitoring transvenous lead was positioned in the right ventricular outflow tract that then transmitted data to a subcutaneously placed device. While promising, the COMPASS-HF (Chronicle Offers Management to Patients With Advanced Signs and Symptoms of Heart Failure) trial showed no advantage to IHM-guided therapy compared with optimal medical management.\n\n【230】Randomized controlled trial of an implantable continuous hemodynamic monitor in patients with advanced heart failure: the COMPASS-HF study.\n\n【231】A subsequent trial, REDUCEhf (Reducing Events in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure), which combined Chronicle technology with an implantable cardiac defibrillator, also showed no benefits.\n\n【232】Continuous hemodynamic monitoring in patients with mild to moderate heart failure: results of the Reducing Decompensation Events Utilizing Intracardiac Pressures in Patients With Chronic Heart Failure (REDUCEhf) trial.\n\n【233】With this combined device, there were also safety concerns because the increased complexity resulting from implanting 2 separate leads in the right ventricular led to an intolerably high risk of IHM lead failure (4% at 4 years).\n\n【234】Another means of invasive monitoring was studied in FAST (Fluid Accumulation Status Trial), a prospective, double-blind study evaluating intrathoracic impedance measurements in predicting HF events.\n\n【235】Intrathoracic impedance vs daily weight monitoring for predicting worsening heart failure events: results of the Fluid Accumulation Status Trial (FAST).\n\n【236】Patients with previously implanted cardioverter defibrillators received a software update (OptiVol; Medtronic Inc) that recorded intrathoracic impedance. The sensitivity of the software to predict HF events was superior compared with that of following changes in weight (76% vs 23%; _P_ <.001). The FAST trial prompted the DOT-HF (Diagnostic Outcome Trial in HF) trial, which randomized 335 patients with HF to receive ambulatory management based on intrathoracic impedance via OptiVol or usual care.\n\n【237】Intrathoracic impedance monitoring, audible patient alerts, and outcome in patients with heart failure.\n\n【238】No clinical benefits were observed with OptiVol-guided therapy; in fact, there were increased ambulatory visits and HF hospitalizations. Of note, this trial was terminated early owing to slow enrollment, with only 355 patients enrolled in a planned 2400-patient study.\n\n【239】In contrast to the previously mentioned IHM devices, the CardioMEMS device (St Jude Medical) is associated with clinical improvements. This device is implanted in the pulmonary artery and measures pressure waveforms in the distal pulmonary artery. In the CHAMPION-HF (CardioMEMS Heart Sensor Allows Monitoring of Pressure to Improve Outcomes in NYHA Class III Heart Failure Subjects) trial, the device was implanted in 550 patients with NYHA class III HF, who were then randomized to a treatment group, which allowed clinicians to use device data for management, or a control group.\n\n【240】Wireless pulmonary artery haemodynamic monitoring in chronic heart failure: a randomised controlled trial.\n\n【241】删除21:<u>CardioMEMS monitoring led to a 28% reduction in HF-related hospitalizations at 6 months and a 37% reduction during follow-up. The intervention group had shorter hospital stays (2.2 days vs 3.8 days) and an improved quality of life. Most importantly, the device was safe, without significant adverse events. Despite controversy about whether this trial adequately blinded CardioMEMS output in the control group, the FDA approved CardioMEMS in 2014.</u>\n\n【242】Although CardioMEMS is the only FDA-approved device, several other IHMs are currently under development. Two notable IHMs are HeartPod (St Jude Medical) and a system developed by Remon Medical Technologies. In brief, HeartPod monitors left atrial pressures and is currently being evaluated in a large randomized controlled trial.\n\n【243】In a pilot trial, 40 patients with NYHA class III or IV HF had an average reduction in left atrial pressures from 17.6 mm Hg in the first 3 months to 14.8 mm Hg; however, the study was underpowered to detect clinical differences.\n\n【244】Physician-directed patient self-management of left atrial pressure in advanced chronic heart failure.\n\n【245】The other device (Remon Medical Technologies) has shown promise in a pilot trial and is currently being evaluated in the PAPIRUS III (Monitoring Pulmonary Artery Pressure by Implantable Device Responding to Ultrasonic Signal) trial.\n\n【246】All in all, IHM devices have a promising future, and we believe that their role in managing HF will continue to evolve as more devices are studied and come to market. Table 5 summarizes the data available for the various preventive strategies.\n\n【247】Table 5 Summary of Preventive Strategies and Recent Evidence\n\n| Intervention | Evidence | Recommendations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【249】ACC = American College of Cardiology; AHA = American Heart Association; FDA = Food and Drug Administration; HF = heart failure; ICD = implantable cardioverter defibrillator; ICG = impedence cardiography; IHM = implantable hemodynamic monitor; LVEDP = left ventricular end diastolic pressure; NYHA = New York Heart Association; RCT = randomized controlled trial; RV = right ventricular.\n\n【250】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【251】Volume overload remains a vexing clinical problem. Previously, clinicians relied on physiologic and pharmacologic principles to guide them in treating and preventing volume overload in these patients. However, as this review illustrates, high-quality clinical trials have provided evidence to guide clinicians in the day-to-day treatment of patients with ADHF. Intriguing small studies have hinted that perhaps not all loop diuretics are created equal and call for larger rigorous clinical trials. Large, well-conducted clinical trials evaluating nesiritide and dopamine suggest that neither drug has a major role in ADHF management. Ultrafiltration remains a promising modality for fluid removal for diuretic-refractory patients, but clinical studies do not suggest benefit for most patients compared with optimal diuretic therapy. The age-old principle of sodium restriction has been called into question by observational and clinical studies, and further prospective investigation is required. Finally, we are at the dawn of the era of invasive hemodynamic monitoring for HF management. However, as we evaluate this exciting new technology, we must remember that it is our duty to ensure that it meets the same standard we require of all other therapies: sound clinical evidence suggesting benefit in treating or preventing volume overload in patients with HF.", "index": 51279, "show": true, "start": 51240, "end": 51697, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:40:01", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:42:50", "cost": 169.319}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:36", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:42:50", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:40:00"}

All patients and at least 1 family member were directly interviewed by the same observer after completion of a semistructured questionnaire. Initially, we classified patients into 2 groups: presence or absence of family history of epilepsy. Patients with a family history of epilepsy were subdivided into 2 groups: patients with a family history of epilepsy in first-degree relatives or multiple relatives (n=5) and patients with a family history of epilepsy in relatives who were not first-degree (n=4). Statistical analysis was performed with use of the nonparametric tests Kruskal-Wallis and Kaplan-Meier (survival analysis). _P_ \\=.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】The ages of the patients ranged from 3 to 41 years (mean, 15.6 years).

These data suggest that some patients, surrogates, physicians, and other care providers believe that this principle extends to the withdrawal of total artificial heart support.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AD ( advance directive ), AICD ( automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ), CVA ( cerebrovascular accident ), ECMO ( extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ), FDA ( US Food and Drug Administration ), IABP ( intra-aortic balloon pump ), ICD ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ), ICU ( intensive care unit ), LST ( life-sustaining therapy ), LVEF ( left ventricular ejection fraction ), MOF ( multiple organ failure ), NPPV ( noninvasive positive pressure ventilation ), PM ( pacemaker ), RRT ( renal replacement therapy ), TAH ( total artificial heart ), VA ( venoarterial ), VAD ( ventricular assist device ), VV ( venovenous )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:32:19", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:32:32", "cost": 12.631}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:36", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:32:31", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:32:18"}

He was born on December 31, 1514, into a wealthy and well-connected Flemish family in Brussels, which was then under the control of the Austrian House of Habsburg. His grandfather had been the Royal Physician to Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I (1459-1519), while his father was an apothecary and served as valet to Maximilian’s imperial successor, Charles V (1500-1558). Vesalius’ birth name was Andries van Wesel, which was later Latinized, as was customary for scientists and other scholars at that time.\n\n【1】After preliminary education in his family’s library and private tutoring, Vesalius entered the Castle College of the University of Leuven in Brabant when he was 13 years old. In 1532, at age 17, he went on to the University of Paris for medical education.\n\n【2】In the 16 <sup>th </sup> century, anatomy in European universities was still taught from the classical Roman texts of Galen. Typically, a medical school professor would read Galen’s text while a barber-surgeon assistant would point to the area that the professor was describing on a cadaver (or, more commonly, an animal). Frequently the anatomy lectures were overly crowded with students who found it difficult to see the described structures. In rare cases in which a cadaver was available to students, the poorly supervised students often mangled the cadaver and obtained little insight into anatomical structures.\n\n【3】Vesalius grew dissatisfied with this method of teaching and resolved to do better. In Paris, Vesalius had the opportunity to perform human dissections himself, as he had access to bodies of a few executed criminals and also to skeletons from a cemetery (the Parisian Cemetery of the Innocents, closed in 1780). He quickly became known as a masterful anatomist.\n\n【4】In 1536, because of hostilities between the Holy Roman Empire and France, Vesalius was forced to leave Paris and return to Leuven, where he graduated after completing a dissertation on the Persian physician and alchemist Rhazes. In early 1537, he went to the University of Padua, which was then part of the Republic of Venice, and was granted a doctoral degree with honors at the end of the year. On the day following his graduation, he was appointed as a professor of surgery and anatomy at the University of the City of Venice, but stayed only briefly before returning to Padua as an instructor and lecturer on anatomy. Recalling his earlier experiences, Vesalius urged his students to perform dissections themselves and developed a systematic approach to demonstrate anatomy to students.\n\n【5】In 1538, with the assistance of Johan van Calcar, an illustrator who had studied with the artist Titian, Vesalius prepared 6 elaborate anatomical plates for teaching anatomy. These plates, known as _Tabulae Anatomicae Sex_ (“Six anatomical tables”), were far superior in detail to any previous anatomic illustrations and increased his reputation.\n\n【6】In 1543, Vesalius published his masterpiece, _De humani corporis fabrica libri septem_ (Latin for “Seven books on the structure of the human body”), with more than 200 woodcut illustrations. A highly regarded Swiss printer and humanist in Basel, Johannes Oporinius (1507-1568), published the book and oversaw its distribution throughout Northern Europe. The 7 books included descriptions of: 1) bones and cartilage; 2) ligaments and muscles 3) veins and arteries; 4) nerves; 5) gastrointestinal and reproductive organs; 6) organs of the thorax; and 7) the brain.\n\n【7】_De Fabrica,_ as it became widely known, quickly became the most influential book on human anatomy. The book was updated in 1555. About 700 copies survive, mostly in medical libraries and museums. A 1543 copy that came up for private auction in 2017 sold for 367,000 Euros (approximately $415,000 USD at the time of the sale).\n\n【8】Vesalius’ experience with dissection led him to challenge Galen’s anatomical findings, which included numerous errors. For example, Galen thought the human sternum included 7 bones and the mandible 2 bones. Galen also believed that the cardiac ventricular septum was porous. Vesalius corrected these and other misconceptions. Vesalius had the advantage of actual human dissection, while he discovered in 1541 that Galen’s anatomy had been largely based on animal dissections. Galen’s texts also lacked illustrations, but _De Fabrica_ included delicate engraved woodcut prints with high-quality illustrations, especially of muscle groups. Finally, Galen did not use a systematic anatomical nomenclature; in contrast, Vesalius identified and enumerated each illustration.\n\n【9】Vesalius presented a unique color copy of _De Fabrica_ to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who was so impressed that he appointed Vesalius the imperial physician in 1544, which largely put an end to Vesalius’ scholarly work.\n\n【10】In 1564, Vesalius visited Jerusalem on a pilgrimage. While in Jerusalem, the senate of Venice requested that he succeed his friend and former student Gabriel Fallopius (1503-1562) as professor of anatomy in Padua, as Fallopius had died. On his way to Padua, however, the vessel Vesalius was traveling on was shipwrecked on the island of Zakynthos (Zante) in the Ionian Sea. This is where Vesalius died and was buried.\n\n【11】Andreas Vesalius is commonly credited as the founder of modern anatomy. He revolutionized the teaching of anatomy and methods of dissection, transforming anatomy into a modern observational science. His work paved the way for developments in physiology, pathology, and comparative anatomy.\n\n【12】Vesalius has been honored philatelically at least 12 times, including 4 times by Belgium. Belgium issued a stamp (Scott number #606) on March 2, 1964, to commemorate the 400 <sup>th </sup> anniversary of his death. The image was adopted from the frontispiece of his masterpiece _De Fabrica_ .

Participants were categorized into risk categories, which determined allocation to an individualized bicycle protocol. The groups at minimal risk (category 1), small risk (category 2), and medium risk (category 3) were tested at 50%, 35% of the predicted maximal workload, and constant level, respectively. We investigated associations of CRF with mortality across different levels of pretest risk and determined whether CRF improves risk prediction.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】During a median follow-up of 5.8 years, 936 deaths occurred. Cardiorespiratory fitness was linearly associated with mortality risk. Comparing extreme fifths of CRF, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for mortality were 0.63 (0.52-0.77), 0.54 (0.36-0.82), 0.81 (0.46-1.43), and 0.58 (0.48-0.69) in categories 1, 2, and 3 and overall population, respectively. The addition of CRF to a 5-year mortality risk score containing established risk factors was associated with a C-index change (0.0012; _P_ \\=.49), integrated discrimination improvement (0.0005; _P_ <.001), net reclassification improvement (+0.0361; _P_ \\=.005), and improved goodness of fit (likelihood ratio test, _P_ <.001). Differences in 5-year survival were more pronounced across levels of age, smoking status, and sex.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Cardiorespiratory fitness, assessed by submaximal exercise testing, improves mortality risk prediction beyond conventional risk factors and its prognostic relevance varies across cardiovascular risk levels.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CPX ( cardiopulmonary exercise testing ), CRF ( cardiorespiratory fitness ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), ECG ( electrocardiography ), HR ( hazard ratio ), IDI ( integrated discrimination improvement ), IQR ( interquartile range ), MET ( metabolic equivalent ), NHS ( National Health Service ), SBP ( systolic blood pressure )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:13:45", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:14:03", "cost": 17.799}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:36", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:14:03", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:13:45"}

Medical informed consent should be an exchange of ideas that buttresses the patient-physician relationship. The consent process should be the foundation of the fiduciary relationship between a patient and a physician. Physicians must recognize that informed medical choice is an educational process and has the potential to affect the patient-physician alliance to their mutual benefit. Physicians must give patients equality in the covenant by educating them to make informed choices. When physicians and patients take medical informed consent seriously, the patient-physician relationship becomes a true partnership with shared decision-making authority and responsibility for outcomes. Physicians need to understand informed medical consent from an ethical foundation, as codified by statutory law in many states, and from a generalized common-law perspective requiring medical practice consistent with the standard of care. It is fundamental to the patient-physician relationship that each partner understands and accepts the degree of autonomy the patient desires in the decision-making process.\n\n【1】删除21:<u>_Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body; and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient's consent commits an assault, for which he is liable in damages._ Justice Benjamin Cardozo, 1914</u>\n\n【2】**M** edical informed consent is ethically, morally, and legally mandated by the fiduciary responsibilities flowing from the patient-physician relationship. Negligence per se occurs when an actor's violation of a statute or regulation causes the kind of harm the statute was intending to prevent.\n\n【3】Ethically, physicians engaged in patient-physician relationships involving medical informed consent have a moral responsibility to identify the best treatments for each patient on the basis of available medical evidence and to discuss with patients the hoped-for benefits and the potential risks. Physicians must allow for patients' questions about the proposed treatments, benefits, and risks and must answer those questions from the available medical literature and their professional experience. This exchange of information and ideas is the foundation of the patient-physician partnership and promotes informed decision making in the most complex medical situations.\n\n【4】Legally, a physician must understand that many states have codified medical informed consent into statutory law, and lack of adherence to the statute can lead to per se negligence for the physician. The jurisdictions vary, and violation of the statute can be considered intrinsically negligent or merely a rebuttable presumption of negligence. Several states have codified medical informed consent to varying degrees . All physicians would be prudent to educate themselves regarding their states' statutory laws concerning medical informed consent. Further, every practicing physician should understand the underpinnings of the common-law analysis of medical informed consent and negligence. The common law and statutory law create a burden on physicians that varies in different jurisdictions.\n\n【5】TABLE 1 States With Statutes and Their Citations\n\n| State | Citation |\n| --- | --- |\n| AK | Alaska Stat 09.55.556 |\n| AR | ACA §16-114-206 |\n| DE | 18 DeC §6852 |\n| FL | Fla Stat 766.103 |\n| GA | OCGA 31-9-6.1 |\n| HI | HRS §671-3 |\n| IN | IC 34-18-12-3 |\n| IA | ICA §147.137 |\n| KY | KRS §304.40-320 |\n| LA | LSA-RS 40:1299.40 |\n| ME | 24 MRSA § 2905 |\n| NE | Neb Rev Stat §44-2816 |\n| NV | NRS 41A.110 |\n| NH | NH Rev Stat §507-E:2 |\n| NY | McKinney's Pub Health L §2805-d |\n| NC | NCGSA §90-21.13 |\n| OH | RC §2317.54 |\n| OR | ORS §677.097 |\n| PA | 40 PS §1303.504 |\n| RI | Tentative.

Understanding this process allows for the exchange of ideas in medical practice that will yield informed decisions and will lead to the best outcomes on the basis of shared information. Further, informed consent limits the potential for negligence cases brought for lack of informed consent. Table 2 provides an outline of teaching points that should be followed in the informed consent process.\n\n【8】TABLE 2 Prudent Behaviors of Physicians Engaged in the Process of Medical Informed Consent\n\n| The physician directly involved in the proposed treatment should conduct the informed consent discussion. The discussion should include the treatment, the risks and benefits of treatment, and alternative therapies with associated risks and benefitsThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment should discuss the most likely outcome with no treatment, on the basis of the best available medical or surgical evidenceThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment should always discuss the severe risks, such as death, paralysis, loss of cognition, or loss of a limb, even if the probability of occurrences is negligibleThe physician involved in the proposed treatment should always disclose less severe risks that occur frequently. Courts do not place emphasis solely on consequences; they recognize frequency as an important component of riskThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment should discuss informed consent in language the patient can understand, and treatment should not proceed until the physician believes the patient understands the risks and benefits and has made a rational decisionThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment must understand that the medical consent form is not medical consent; it represents evidence that the consent process occurred. The dialogue between the patient and physician is the essence of the consent processThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment should document all patient-imposed restrictions in the medical record and the discussion with the patient about how the restrictions limit the physician's ability to provide standard medical careThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment may advise the patient to seek care with an alternative health care provider if the restrictions imposed by the patient seem to inhibit good medical practice and seem likely to lead to a suboptimal medical outcomeThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment must understand the informed consent can be withdrawn at any time. When physicians allow 24 to 48 hours for patients to reflect after consent to a treatment strategy, the period of reflection validates the notion of informed consent. Withdrawal of consent should include a discussion and documentation through a withdrawal of consent form on which time and date are notedWhen physicians and patients take medical informed consent seriously, the patient-physician relationship becomes a partnership, with shared authority, decision making, and responsibility for outcomesThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment can enhance the informed consent process through appropriate use of additional learning materials, such as pamphlets and video, and through involvement of support staff, such as physician assistants, in providing information that can be discussed by the responsible physician |\n| --- |\n\n【10】GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS IN INFORMED CONSENT\n------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Informed consent is the legal embodiment of the concept that each individual has the right to make decisions affecting his or her health. It is generally accepted that patients should consider the potential risks and benefits flowing from their medical decisions. Patients must acknowledge those potential risks and benefits to make informed decisions. Generally, the law protects the patient's right to informed consent by requiring physicians to disclose all pertinent information about risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient. Medical informed consent law requires disclosure of the risks of the suggested medical procedure and the risks of the alternatives to enable patients to make knowledgeable decisions.\n\n【12】A patient's understanding of thepotential risks of proposed treatment is critical to medical informed consent.\n\n【13】Risk can be defined as exposure to a chance of injury or loss.\n\n【14】This definition contains 2 distinct components: (1) chance related to uncertain events—those that are unpredictable in any single case, but for which a probability that an event will occur in any 1 case can be estimated through statistical pooling of large databases, and (2) injury or loss, including any consequences for which the patient sustains a disability. The law places a positive obligation on physicians to disclose information about the risks to any patient who is at risk of an adverse event, that is, who will suffer injury if a chance event occurs.\n\n【15】DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT LAW\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】Medical informed consent law developed from the intentional tort of battery, which protects individuals from an unwanted physical touching of the body by others having neither express nor implied consent of the person touched. Battery occurs in medicine when a physician performs a treatment without the patient's consent, performs a substantially different procedure than the one for which consent was given, or exceeds the scope of the consent, or when a physician other than the one to whom consent was given carries out the procedure.\n\n【17】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【18】The legal analysis of medical informed consent has evolved over the years from an allegation of battery to an allegation of negligence. Currently, the courts nearly unanimously characterize lack of informed consent as a matter of negligence of the physician to disclose necessary information to patients.\n\n【19】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【20】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【21】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【22】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【23】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【26】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【27】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【28】Negligence requires that 4 elements be established for liability of the physician-defendant: (1) a duty of the physician to meet a particular standard of care, (2) the physician's failure to perform that duty, (3) a causal connection (proximate cause) between the physician's failure and the patient's injury, and (4) an injury for which monetary compensation is adequate relief.\n\n【29】A TYPICAL MEDICAL INFORMED CONSENT CASE\n---------------------------------------\n\n【30】A typical medical informed consent case usually arises in conjunction with an underlying medical procedure. For example, if a patient suffers a stroke during an invasive vascular procedure, the patient might allege—in addition to and separate from any medical malpractice claim—that, because the physician did not discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure and reasonable alternatives to it, the patient could not make an informed decision whether to proceed. As previously noted, to establish a lack of informed consent case, a patient must first show that the physician had a duty to discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure and reasonable alternatives to it with the patient, and that discussion should have been in accordance with an accepted standard within the medical community.\n\n【31】That is, the physician is expected only to disclose risks that might reasonably be known to occur with the particular procedure. Therefore, the discussion might vary depending on the nature of the procedure and the patient's relevant comorbidities. States have applied different approaches in articulating the standard regarding the physician's duty to disclose.\n\n【32】DEFINING THE STANDARD OF DISCLOSURE\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】Two dominant approaches, the “professional” standard and the “materiality” standard, define the standard of disclosure of information by which a physician's duty to the patient is measured.\n\n【34】The professional standard requires the physician to disclose information that other physicians possessing the same skills and practicing in the same or a similar community disclose in a similar situation.\n\n【35】The second approach by courts is the materiality or “prudent patient” approach, allowing the jury to decide whether other information would have been considered important by a reasonable patient in making a decision and therefore requiring disclosure.\n\n【36】The courts recognize situations when a physician's nondisclosure will be excused, including cases of the patient's mental incompetence, medical emergencies, and the therapeutic privilege exception.\n\n【37】If a patient is incompetent to make a reasoned decision, then disclosure to the patient might not be required.\n\n【38】The physician can also withhold information under the therapeutic privilege if disclosure would interfere with treatment or would adversely affect the condition or recovery of the patient.\n\n【39】The emergency exception to disclosure applies in situations where attempting to secure consent would delay necessary and proper treatment.\n\n【40】Last, physicians need not disclose risks of which the patient is already aware or risks that are commonly known.\n\n【41】Individual state law and court decisions determine which approaches and exceptions apply in an individual physician's practice.\n\n【42】PHYSICIAN'S DUTY TO DISCLOSE RISK INFORMATION\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【43】Materiality jurisdiction courts have attempted to provide some guidance for physicians by suggesting that the physician's duty to disclose risk increases as the magnitude of the risk increases. These courts uniformly fail to give explicit guidelines or to identify on what scale risks are to be measured.\n\n【44】All severe risks (death, paralysis, loss of cognition, loss of a limb) should always be disclosed, even if the probability of occurrence is negligible. Further, even less severe risks, if frequent, should always be disclosed. Nominal risks with low probability of occurrence need not be disclosed. Courts do not place emphasis solely on consequences, recognizing frequency as an important component of risk.\n\n【45】The professional standard asserts the doctor's duty to disclose is what a reasonably prudent physician with the same background, training, and experience would have disclosed to the patient in the same or similar circumstances. The professional standard does not give explicit guidelines regarding the disclosure of risks.\n\n【46】The courts stress that full disclosure is not required. Full disclosure is a slippery slope for physicians involved in medical informed consent. There are reasons full disclosure as a standard of practice should not be expected. First, the number of risks possible from even a routine procedure is large, and potential risks can span a range of consequences. For example, in a footnote, the California Supreme Court listed some of the risks of having blood drawn: “\\[T\\]he risks…are said to include hematoma, dermatitis, cellulitis, abscess, osteomyelitis, and death, to mention a few.”\n\n【47】Second, the burden of identifying small consequences in extremely unlikely risks is too great a burden on the physician, and the resulting choice by the patient will be impaired by a litany of consequences. Despite the courts' pronouncements that full disclosure is not required, they have failed to delineate any clear limits on what must be disclosed. The California Supreme Court articulated this uncertainty: “One cannot know with certainty which medical consent is valid until a lawsuit is filed and resolved.”\n\n【48】There does not appear to be a standard of disclosure to which physicians can adhere to avoid liability with certitude.\n\n【49】DOCTRINE OF MEDICAL INFORMED CONSENT\n------------------------------------\n\n【50】The doctrine of medical informed consent states that, before a patient elects to proceed with a treatment that has risk, there must be a balanced discussion of the treatment strategy, including the potential risks and hoped-for benefits. The magnitude of the risks and their frequency should receive special emphasis. Also considered are alternative treatments and their benefits, risks, and measured utility; the likely results of no treatment; and the probability of a good outcome with the proposed strategy. A good outcome and the major anticipated problems during recovery are described as well as the estimated time to resume normal life activities. This information must be presented in language the patient can understand, and treatment should not proceed until the physician believes the patient understands the risks and benefits and decides to proceed on the foundation of that understanding.\n\n【51】The legal foundation for adopting the doctrine of medical informed consent is 2-fold: (1) to establish and promote patient autonomy and (2) to promote informed, rational decisions. The courts hold that it is reasonable to require physicians to inform, educate, and partner with patients because patients are generally unable to dissect the details of medical science needed to make an educated decision about treatment.\n\n【52】This educational process should inform the patient enough to allow for an informed decision. Information disclosure will not necessarily lead to an ideal patient-physician partnership, but it should promote patient autonomy in the decision-making process and achieve a foundation for an ethical and trusting relationship between a physician and patient.\n\n【53】To give valid informed consent, the patient must be competent and the patient's actions must be voluntary. _Voluntary_ means “of free mind and free will.” The patient must not be cognitively impaired by medication, personal emotional stress, or external stress by family members or physicians. For example, one case involved a patient who was given a sedative to sleep and subsequently awakened in the middle of the night to give consent for a hernia operation. The court held that the medical consent was invalid because the patient was unlikely to understand what permission he had granted after being awakened from sleep and after taking a sedative.\n\n【54】Determining incompetence and competence is a matter for the court and not a question of fact for the layperson. In medical informed consent the focus should be on the capacity of the patient. Capacity means the ability to process information received and to communicate a meaningful response. An element of capacity is that the person making the decision is an adult and has not been judged incompetent or is not otherwise prohibited by law from exercising that decision-making capacity. _Decision-making capacity_ means the ability to understand the significant benefits, risks, and alternative to proposed health care and to make and communicate a health care decision.\n\n【55】MEDICAL CONSENT\n---------------\n\n【56】The purpose of medical consent, through medical consent forms and through documentation of the informed consent discussion in the medical record, is to have evidence of the exact terms of the medical consent in case of future disagreement. If a patient sues a physician, an outpatient surgery center, a medical group, or a hospital and alleges lack of informed consent, the defendant will be able to present the written consent form or the documentation of the discussion in court as evidence that medical consent was in fact secured. If the medical consent form or documentation of the discussion in the medical record is comprehensive and specific in terms of risks and benefits, and if the medical consent was granted voluntarily by a competent patient who understood the information presented, the probability of a successful lawsuit is low.\n\n【57】However, the medical consent form does not equate to medical consent. Rather, it represents evidence that the medical consent process occurred. A patient could present evidence that medical informed consent did not occur, despite a signed form,\n\n【58】for example, when a nurse presented the risks to the patient and the physician signed the form as if consent had been obtained.\n\n【59】What should a medical consent form contain? First, a consent form is not necessary to achieve valid medically informed consent. If an entity, such as a hospital, an outpatient surgery center, or other health care organization, chooses to honor a medical informed consent form, the form should contain all the information needed to comply with the elements of medical informed consent. The form should contain an accurate description of the proposed procedure, the risks and benefits of the proposed procedure, the potential advantages and disadvantages of no treatment, alternative treatment strategies and their risks and benefits, the potential for a successful outcome, the estimated recuperation time, and the estimated time required to return to normal activity. The consent form should contain the name of the physician involved and clauses dealing with photography, disposition, and use of removed tissues, organs, and body parts. Patients should be made aware that they are allowed to strike out any part of the medical consent form with which they do not agree or to which they do not consent. If a patient does not understand details of the treatment, the patient and physician should discuss treatment and risks to reach mutual understanding.\n\n【60】If a physician believes the limits placed on the medical informed consent hamper standard medical practice, he or she should document all the patient-imposed restrictions in the record, with a discussion of how the limits placed on the physician limit his or her ability to proceed in a standard fashion, and that the limits were described to the patient. Alternatively, if a physician believes the restrictions seriously inhibit good medical practice and might lead to a suboptimal clinical outcome, he or she may advise the patient to seek care with another physician.\n\n【61】WITHDRAWING CONSENT OR REFUSING TREATMENT\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【62】May a patient withdraw consent after signing a medical consent form? Consent must be freely given and can be freely withdrawn at any time. Whether consent was given orally or in writing does not affect the patient's ability to change or withdraw consent. Physicians may choose to allow 24 to 48 hours for patients to reflect after consent to a treatment strategy. During this time, patients can weigh the alternatives and come to an independent conclusion either to proceed with or to withdraw from the proposed treatment. A time for patients to appraise the risks and benefits reinforces the validity of medical informed consent. If a patient orally indicates a desire to withdraw medical consent, the physician would be wise to execute a withdrawal of consent form, noting time of day and date consent was withdrawn, or to carefully document in the medical record the details of consent withdrawal including a time and date.\n\n【63】May a patient refuse treatment? A competent patient may decline any and all treatment. Even mentally ill patients are generally considered competent to refuse treatment. Physicians would be prudent to have a patient who has been diagnosed with mental illness and who refuses an apparently beneficial treatment evaluated by a psychiatrist. In some situations, patients can be compelled to receive treatment.\n\n【64】For example, a mentally ill patient could be considered a danger to society and institutionalized against his or her will.\n\n【65】Competent individuals with contagious diseases may refuse treatment, but public health officials may quarantine or involuntarily hospitalize and isolate them if they are dangerous to other people.\n\n【66】This policy is based on broad “police power” that states have (and can exercise through their departments of health) to protect the health and safety of the public. The reason for refusal of treatment can be rational or irrational. Whether rational or irrational, decisions are legally binding on the physician and the hospital. Individual freedom is guaranteed only if people are given the right to make choices that would generally be regarded as irrational behavior.\n\n【67】Some states also require hospitals to ensure proper consent is obtained for no treatment. This consent for no treatment should contain a release of medical responsibility and any associated liability for the hospital, nurses, and employees, together with all physicians connected in any way to the patient.\n\n【68】GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE AND INFORMED CONSENT\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【69】Are good clinical practice and informed consent inseparable? Respect for patient autonomy in clinical practice is of great moral importance in our society. The moral and legal responsibility of medical informed consent depends on the transmission of appropriate information to patients. We believe patients' choices must not be coerced by members of the health care team or by other third parties, such as friends, family, or payers. Equally, we believe patients must be competent to consent; they must understand, remember, consider, and believe clinical information given to them about the specific treatments. The moral foundation for the requirement of medical informed consent in general is not disputed. The question arises whether in certain situations exceptions from the general requirement of medical informed consent would be acceptable. An exception to medical informed consent could be motivated by the idea that an exception is reasonable if insistence on the requirement of medical informed consent causes more harm than good.\n\n【70】INFORMED CONSENT IN EMERGENCIES\n-------------------------------\n\n【71】Is medical informed consent always necessary in emergency medical situations? Is a patient who is having an acute myocardial infarction sufficiently competent to understand what he or she is being told? In a survey of Swedish cardiologists about their perceptions of medical informed consent during acute myocardial infarction, 86% thought that patients were unable to comprehend all the information provided and so, by definition, were unable to give fully informed consent.\n\n【72】What evidence is there that patients with acute illnesses themselves fail to understand all the issues in the medical informed consent process? A report from the Fourth International Study of Infarct Survival revealed that only 31% of 129 patients perceived that they had full comprehension of the trial, and 19% thought they did not understand the trial.\n\n【73】Patient comprehension and reaction to participating in a double-blind randomized clinical trial (ISIS-4) in acute myocardial infarction.\n\n【74】A review of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage revealed only 19% of those who had given medical informed consent themselves could remember the consent process.\n\n【75】The studies suggest that during a medical emergency many of the patients were too ill to give fully informed consent. Does this mean that patients with an acute myocardial infarction or subarachnoid hemorrhage are unable to engage in the decision-making process of medical informed consent? The answer is no. Although acute myocardial infarction is a medical emergency and there is evidence that some patients do not fully comprehend all the information to make a fully informed decision, some patients do comprehend and are capable of doing so. A dialoguebetween the physician and patient is essential. This is a unique opportunity to involve appropriate family members or health care surrogates in decision making during emergencies. Patients do not need to stand alone in the patient-physician partnership.\n\n【76】THE PARADOX OF CHOICE\n---------------------\n\n【77】Responsibility for medical care has landed on the shoulders of patients with a resounding thud. Patients have the choice of telling physicians what to do in relation to health care decisions. The tone of medical practice has shifted from paternalistic to consultative, in which the physician lays the possibilities before the patient, with the potential pluses and minuses of each, and the patient makes a choice. This attitude has been well described by Atul Gawande: “Only a decade ago, doctors made the decisions, patients did what they were told. Doctors did not consult patients about their desires and priorities…. They were regarded as children: too fragile and simple minded to handle the truth, let alone make decisions.”\n\n【78】According to Gawande, _The Silent World of Doctor and Patient_ , by physician and ethicist Jay Katz, launched us into the era of autonomous patient choice. There is little doubt that this change in the decision-making paradigm has improved the quality of medical care generally. Yet no single paradigm fits all patients. Gawande suggests the shift in responsibility has gone too far: “The new orthodoxy about patient autonomy has a hard time acknowledging an awkward truth: patients frequently don't want the freedom that we've given them. That is, they're glad to have their autonomy respected, but the exercise of that autonomy means choosing sometimes to relinquish it.”\n\n【79】Gawande describes a family medical emergency where his newborn daughter stopped breathing, and the family rushed her to the emergency department. The physicians on duty asked Gawande if he wanted his daughter intubated. He said that he wanted the physicians to make that decision for him: the uncertainties were savage, and he did not want to bear the responsibility of making the wrong call.\n\n【80】Gawande did not want to have to live with the guilt of making the wrong call.\n\n【81】When it comes to medical treatment, patients see choice as a burden and a blessing. Physicians must evaluate each patient-physician relationship individually and identify the level of responsibility each party wants to assume in the decision-making process. This process must be documented in the medical record and must detail the assumed responsibilities of each partner in the patient-physician relationship. The art of medicine demands an ability to apply multiple paradigms to the decision-making process when guiding patients through complex medical decisions. This process requires empathy, time, mutual understanding, and courage.\n\n【82】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【83】Medical informed consent is essential to a true patient-physician relationship. Patients need to participate in the informed consent process to understand the risk-benefit relationship for the proposed treatment strategy; this understanding is essential because patients are often psychologically regressed secondary to the realization that they are confronting a life-preserving procedure. Physicians need to participate in the informed consent process to provide patients with the best treatment available by sharing decision making and limiting any potential for liability. Medical ethics, common law, and, in many states, codified statutory law  mandate the informed consent process. Physicians would be prudent to be knowledgeable in these areas of medical ethics, common law, and statutory law. Physicians would be prudent also to understand that the consent process is vital to the physician-patient relationship and that no single paradigm can define the ethical, medical, and legal approach a physician should undertake to achieve informed consent. The process should be individualized within the boundaries of the patient's desires for autonomy, thus reflecting true patient autonomy.\n\n【84】TABLE 3 Ideal Statute Outlining Physicians' Duty to Disclose\n\n| Information shall be supplied to the patient or the patient's guardian or legal surrogate before obtaining consent to a proposed medical or surgical treatment or a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure as followsDescribe condition to be treatedDescribe proposed treatment or procedureOutline intended and anticipated results of proposed treatment or procedureDescribe recognized alternative treatments or procedures, including the option of not using these treatments or proceduresDescribe recognized material risks of serious complications or mortality associated with the followingProposed treatment or procedureRecognized alternative treatments or proceduresNo treatment or procedureOutline recognized benefits of alternative treatments or procedures and risks of alternative treatmentsDisclosure of information and consent provided for in this statute shall not be required in certain conditionsEmergencies as defined by statuteWhen surgical or diagnostic procedure is generally recognized by reasonably prudent physicians not to involve a material risk to the patientWhen the patient, another person, or people authorized to give consent pursuant to this chapter make a request in writing that the information provided for in this Code section not be disclosedWhen prior consent has been obtained within 30 days of the surgical or diagnostic procedure as a part of a course of treatment for the patient's condition, complying with the requirements of this statute for the surgical or diagnostic procedure; provided, however, that if such consent is obtained in conjunction with the patient's admission to a hospital for the performance of such procedure, the consent shall be valid for 30 days from the date of admission or for the period the person is confined in the hospital for that purpose, whichever is greaterWhen the surgical or diagnostic procedure is unforeseen or is not known to be needed at the time consent is obtained, and the patient has consented to allow the responsible physician to make the decision concerning such procedure |\n| --- |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【1】删除21:Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body; and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient’s consent commits an assault, for which he is liable in damages.", "content": "【0】Medical Informed Consent: General Considerations for Physicians\nMedical informed consent is essential to the physician's ability to diagnose and treat patients as well as the patient's right to accept or reject clinical evaluation, treatment, or both. Medical informed consent should be an exchange of ideas that buttresses the patient-physician relationship. The consent process should be the foundation of the fiduciary relationship between a patient and a physician. Physicians must recognize that informed medical choice is an educational process and has the potential to affect the patient-physician alliance to their mutual benefit. Physicians must give patients equality in the covenant by educating them to make informed choices. When physicians and patients take medical informed consent seriously, the patient-physician relationship becomes a true partnership with shared decision-making authority and responsibility for outcomes. Physicians need to understand informed medical consent from an ethical foundation, as codified by statutory law in many states, and from a generalized common-law perspective requiring medical practice consistent with the standard of care. It is fundamental to the patient-physician relationship that each partner understands and accepts the degree of autonomy the patient desires in the decision-making process.\n\n【1】删除21:<u>_Every human being of adult years and sound mind has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body; and a surgeon who performs an operation without his patient's consent commits an assault, for which he is liable in damages._ Justice Benjamin Cardozo, 1914</u>\n\n【2】**M** edical informed consent is ethically, morally, and legally mandated by the fiduciary responsibilities flowing from the patient-physician relationship. Negligence per se occurs when an actor's violation of a statute or regulation causes the kind of harm the statute was intending to prevent.\n\n【3】Ethically, physicians engaged in patient-physician relationships involving medical informed consent have a moral responsibility to identify the best treatments for each patient on the basis of available medical evidence and to discuss with patients the hoped-for benefits and the potential risks. Physicians must allow for patients' questions about the proposed treatments, benefits, and risks and must answer those questions from the available medical literature and their professional experience. This exchange of information and ideas is the foundation of the patient-physician partnership and promotes informed decision making in the most complex medical situations.\n\n【4】Legally, a physician must understand that many states have codified medical informed consent into statutory law, and lack of adherence to the statute can lead to per se negligence for the physician. The jurisdictions vary, and violation of the statute can be considered intrinsically negligent or merely a rebuttable presumption of negligence. Several states have codified medical informed consent to varying degrees . All physicians would be prudent to educate themselves regarding their states' statutory laws concerning medical informed consent. Further, every practicing physician should understand the underpinnings of the common-law analysis of medical informed consent and negligence. The common law and statutory law create a burden on physicians that varies in different jurisdictions.\n\n【5】TABLE 1 States With Statutes and Their Citations\n\n| State | Citation |\n| --- | --- |\n| AK | Alaska Stat 09.55.556 |\n| AR | ACA §16-114-206 |\n| DE | 18 DeC §6852 |\n| FL | Fla Stat 766.103 |\n| GA | OCGA 31-9-6.1 |\n| HI | HRS §671-3 |\n| IN | IC 34-18-12-3 |\n| IA | ICA §147.137 |\n| KY | KRS §304.40-320 |\n| LA | LSA-RS 40:1299.40 |\n| ME | 24 MRSA § 2905 |\n| NE | Neb Rev Stat §44-2816 |\n| NV | NRS 41A.110 |\n| NH | NH Rev Stat §507-E:2 |\n| NY | McKinney's Pub Health L §2805-d |\n| NC | NCGSA §90-21.13 |\n| OH | RC §2317.54 |\n| OR | ORS §677.097 |\n| PA | 40 PS §1303.504 |\n| RI | Tentative.

Understanding this process allows for the exchange of ideas in medical practice that will yield informed decisions and will lead to the best outcomes on the basis of shared information. Further, informed consent limits the potential for negligence cases brought for lack of informed consent. Table 2 provides an outline of teaching points that should be followed in the informed consent process.\n\n【8】TABLE 2 Prudent Behaviors of Physicians Engaged in the Process of Medical Informed Consent\n\n| The physician directly involved in the proposed treatment should conduct the informed consent discussion. The discussion should include the treatment, the risks and benefits of treatment, and alternative therapies with associated risks and benefitsThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment should discuss the most likely outcome with no treatment, on the basis of the best available medical or surgical evidenceThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment should always discuss the severe risks, such as death, paralysis, loss of cognition, or loss of a limb, even if the probability of occurrences is negligibleThe physician involved in the proposed treatment should always disclose less severe risks that occur frequently. Courts do not place emphasis solely on consequences; they recognize frequency as an important component of riskThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment should discuss informed consent in language the patient can understand, and treatment should not proceed until the physician believes the patient understands the risks and benefits and has made a rational decisionThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment must understand that the medical consent form is not medical consent; it represents evidence that the consent process occurred. The dialogue between the patient and physician is the essence of the consent processThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment should document all patient-imposed restrictions in the medical record and the discussion with the patient about how the restrictions limit the physician's ability to provide standard medical careThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment may advise the patient to seek care with an alternative health care provider if the restrictions imposed by the patient seem to inhibit good medical practice and seem likely to lead to a suboptimal medical outcomeThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment must understand the informed consent can be withdrawn at any time. When physicians allow 24 to 48 hours for patients to reflect after consent to a treatment strategy, the period of reflection validates the notion of informed consent. Withdrawal of consent should include a discussion and documentation through a withdrawal of consent form on which time and date are notedWhen physicians and patients take medical informed consent seriously, the patient-physician relationship becomes a partnership, with shared authority, decision making, and responsibility for outcomesThe physician directly involved in the proposed treatment can enhance the informed consent process through appropriate use of additional learning materials, such as pamphlets and video, and through involvement of support staff, such as physician assistants, in providing information that can be discussed by the responsible physician |\n| --- |\n\n【10】GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS IN INFORMED CONSENT\n------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Informed consent is the legal embodiment of the concept that each individual has the right to make decisions affecting his or her health. It is generally accepted that patients should consider the potential risks and benefits flowing from their medical decisions. Patients must acknowledge those potential risks and benefits to make informed decisions. Generally, the law protects the patient's right to informed consent by requiring physicians to disclose all pertinent information about risks and benefits of the procedure to the patient. Medical informed consent law requires disclosure of the risks of the suggested medical procedure and the risks of the alternatives to enable patients to make knowledgeable decisions.\n\n【12】A patient's understanding of thepotential risks of proposed treatment is critical to medical informed consent.\n\n【13】Risk can be defined as exposure to a chance of injury or loss.\n\n【14】This definition contains 2 distinct components: (1) chance related to uncertain events—those that are unpredictable in any single case, but for which a probability that an event will occur in any 1 case can be estimated through statistical pooling of large databases, and (2) injury or loss, including any consequences for which the patient sustains a disability. The law places a positive obligation on physicians to disclose information about the risks to any patient who is at risk of an adverse event, that is, who will suffer injury if a chance event occurs.\n\n【15】DEVELOPMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT LAW\n-----------------------------------\n\n【16】Medical informed consent law developed from the intentional tort of battery, which protects individuals from an unwanted physical touching of the body by others having neither express nor implied consent of the person touched. Battery occurs in medicine when a physician performs a treatment without the patient's consent, performs a substantially different procedure than the one for which consent was given, or exceeds the scope of the consent, or when a physician other than the one to whom consent was given carries out the procedure.\n\n【17】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【18】The legal analysis of medical informed consent has evolved over the years from an allegation of battery to an allegation of negligence. Currently, the courts nearly unanimously characterize lack of informed consent as a matter of negligence of the physician to disclose necessary information to patients.\n\n【19】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【20】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【21】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【22】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【23】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【26】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【27】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【28】Negligence requires that 4 elements be established for liability of the physician-defendant: (1) a duty of the physician to meet a particular standard of care, (2) the physician's failure to perform that duty, (3) a causal connection (proximate cause) between the physician's failure and the patient's injury, and (4) an injury for which monetary compensation is adequate relief.\n\n【29】A TYPICAL MEDICAL INFORMED CONSENT CASE\n---------------------------------------\n\n【30】A typical medical informed consent case usually arises in conjunction with an underlying medical procedure. For example, if a patient suffers a stroke during an invasive vascular procedure, the patient might allege—in addition to and separate from any medical malpractice claim—that, because the physician did not discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure and reasonable alternatives to it, the patient could not make an informed decision whether to proceed. As previously noted, to establish a lack of informed consent case, a patient must first show that the physician had a duty to discuss the risks and benefits of the procedure and reasonable alternatives to it with the patient, and that discussion should have been in accordance with an accepted standard within the medical community.\n\n【31】That is, the physician is expected only to disclose risks that might reasonably be known to occur with the particular procedure. Therefore, the discussion might vary depending on the nature of the procedure and the patient's relevant comorbidities. States have applied different approaches in articulating the standard regarding the physician's duty to disclose.\n\n【32】DEFINING THE STANDARD OF DISCLOSURE\n-----------------------------------\n\n【33】Two dominant approaches, the “professional” standard and the “materiality” standard, define the standard of disclosure of information by which a physician's duty to the patient is measured.\n\n【34】The professional standard requires the physician to disclose information that other physicians possessing the same skills and practicing in the same or a similar community disclose in a similar situation.\n\n【35】The second approach by courts is the materiality or “prudent patient” approach, allowing the jury to decide whether other information would have been considered important by a reasonable patient in making a decision and therefore requiring disclosure.\n\n【36】The courts recognize situations when a physician's nondisclosure will be excused, including cases of the patient's mental incompetence, medical emergencies, and the therapeutic privilege exception.\n\n【37】If a patient is incompetent to make a reasoned decision, then disclosure to the patient might not be required.\n\n【38】The physician can also withhold information under the therapeutic privilege if disclosure would interfere with treatment or would adversely affect the condition or recovery of the patient.\n\n【39】The emergency exception to disclosure applies in situations where attempting to secure consent would delay necessary and proper treatment.\n\n【40】Last, physicians need not disclose risks of which the patient is already aware or risks that are commonly known.\n\n【41】Individual state law and court decisions determine which approaches and exceptions apply in an individual physician's practice.\n\n【42】PHYSICIAN'S DUTY TO DISCLOSE RISK INFORMATION\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【43】Materiality jurisdiction courts have attempted to provide some guidance for physicians by suggesting that the physician's duty to disclose risk increases as the magnitude of the risk increases. These courts uniformly fail to give explicit guidelines or to identify on what scale risks are to be measured.\n\n【44】All severe risks (death, paralysis, loss of cognition, loss of a limb) should always be disclosed, even if the probability of occurrence is negligible. Further, even less severe risks, if frequent, should always be disclosed. Nominal risks with low probability of occurrence need not be disclosed. Courts do not place emphasis solely on consequences, recognizing frequency as an important component of risk.\n\n【45】The professional standard asserts the doctor's duty to disclose is what a reasonably prudent physician with the same background, training, and experience would have disclosed to the patient in the same or similar circumstances. The professional standard does not give explicit guidelines regarding the disclosure of risks.\n\n【46】The courts stress that full disclosure is not required. Full disclosure is a slippery slope for physicians involved in medical informed consent. There are reasons full disclosure as a standard of practice should not be expected. First, the number of risks possible from even a routine procedure is large, and potential risks can span a range of consequences. For example, in a footnote, the California Supreme Court listed some of the risks of having blood drawn: “\\[T\\]he risks…are said to include hematoma, dermatitis, cellulitis, abscess, osteomyelitis, and death, to mention a few.”\n\n【47】Second, the burden of identifying small consequences in extremely unlikely risks is too great a burden on the physician, and the resulting choice by the patient will be impaired by a litany of consequences. Despite the courts' pronouncements that full disclosure is not required, they have failed to delineate any clear limits on what must be disclosed. The California Supreme Court articulated this uncertainty: “One cannot know with certainty which medical consent is valid until a lawsuit is filed and resolved.”\n\n【48】There does not appear to be a standard of disclosure to which physicians can adhere to avoid liability with certitude.\n\n【49】DOCTRINE OF MEDICAL INFORMED CONSENT\n------------------------------------\n\n【50】The doctrine of medical informed consent states that, before a patient elects to proceed with a treatment that has risk, there must be a balanced discussion of the treatment strategy, including the potential risks and hoped-for benefits. The magnitude of the risks and their frequency should receive special emphasis. Also considered are alternative treatments and their benefits, risks, and measured utility; the likely results of no treatment; and the probability of a good outcome with the proposed strategy. A good outcome and the major anticipated problems during recovery are described as well as the estimated time to resume normal life activities. This information must be presented in language the patient can understand, and treatment should not proceed until the physician believes the patient understands the risks and benefits and decides to proceed on the foundation of that understanding.\n\n【51】The legal foundation for adopting the doctrine of medical informed consent is 2-fold: (1) to establish and promote patient autonomy and (2) to promote informed, rational decisions. The courts hold that it is reasonable to require physicians to inform, educate, and partner with patients because patients are generally unable to dissect the details of medical science needed to make an educated decision about treatment.\n\n【52】This educational process should inform the patient enough to allow for an informed decision. Information disclosure will not necessarily lead to an ideal patient-physician partnership, but it should promote patient autonomy in the decision-making process and achieve a foundation for an ethical and trusting relationship between a physician and patient.\n\n【53】To give valid informed consent, the patient must be competent and the patient's actions must be voluntary. _Voluntary_ means “of free mind and free will.” The patient must not be cognitively impaired by medication, personal emotional stress, or external stress by family members or physicians. For example, one case involved a patient who was given a sedative to sleep and subsequently awakened in the middle of the night to give consent for a hernia operation. The court held that the medical consent was invalid because the patient was unlikely to understand what permission he had granted after being awakened from sleep and after taking a sedative.\n\n【54】Determining incompetence and competence is a matter for the court and not a question of fact for the layperson. In medical informed consent the focus should be on the capacity of the patient. Capacity means the ability to process information received and to communicate a meaningful response. An element of capacity is that the person making the decision is an adult and has not been judged incompetent or is not otherwise prohibited by law from exercising that decision-making capacity. _Decision-making capacity_ means the ability to understand the significant benefits, risks, and alternative to proposed health care and to make and communicate a health care decision.\n\n【55】MEDICAL CONSENT\n---------------\n\n【56】The purpose of medical consent, through medical consent forms and through documentation of the informed consent discussion in the medical record, is to have evidence of the exact terms of the medical consent in case of future disagreement. If a patient sues a physician, an outpatient surgery center, a medical group, or a hospital and alleges lack of informed consent, the defendant will be able to present the written consent form or the documentation of the discussion in court as evidence that medical consent was in fact secured. If the medical consent form or documentation of the discussion in the medical record is comprehensive and specific in terms of risks and benefits, and if the medical consent was granted voluntarily by a competent patient who understood the information presented, the probability of a successful lawsuit is low.\n\n【57】However, the medical consent form does not equate to medical consent. Rather, it represents evidence that the medical consent process occurred. A patient could present evidence that medical informed consent did not occur, despite a signed form,\n\n【58】for example, when a nurse presented the risks to the patient and the physician signed the form as if consent had been obtained.\n\n【59】What should a medical consent form contain? First, a consent form is not necessary to achieve valid medically informed consent. If an entity, such as a hospital, an outpatient surgery center, or other health care organization, chooses to honor a medical informed consent form, the form should contain all the information needed to comply with the elements of medical informed consent. The form should contain an accurate description of the proposed procedure, the risks and benefits of the proposed procedure, the potential advantages and disadvantages of no treatment, alternative treatment strategies and their risks and benefits, the potential for a successful outcome, the estimated recuperation time, and the estimated time required to return to normal activity. The consent form should contain the name of the physician involved and clauses dealing with photography, disposition, and use of removed tissues, organs, and body parts. Patients should be made aware that they are allowed to strike out any part of the medical consent form with which they do not agree or to which they do not consent. If a patient does not understand details of the treatment, the patient and physician should discuss treatment and risks to reach mutual understanding.\n\n【60】If a physician believes the limits placed on the medical informed consent hamper standard medical practice, he or she should document all the patient-imposed restrictions in the record, with a discussion of how the limits placed on the physician limit his or her ability to proceed in a standard fashion, and that the limits were described to the patient. Alternatively, if a physician believes the restrictions seriously inhibit good medical practice and might lead to a suboptimal clinical outcome, he or she may advise the patient to seek care with another physician.\n\n【61】WITHDRAWING CONSENT OR REFUSING TREATMENT\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【62】May a patient withdraw consent after signing a medical consent form? Consent must be freely given and can be freely withdrawn at any time. Whether consent was given orally or in writing does not affect the patient's ability to change or withdraw consent. Physicians may choose to allow 24 to 48 hours for patients to reflect after consent to a treatment strategy. During this time, patients can weigh the alternatives and come to an independent conclusion either to proceed with or to withdraw from the proposed treatment. A time for patients to appraise the risks and benefits reinforces the validity of medical informed consent. If a patient orally indicates a desire to withdraw medical consent, the physician would be wise to execute a withdrawal of consent form, noting time of day and date consent was withdrawn, or to carefully document in the medical record the details of consent withdrawal including a time and date.\n\n【63】May a patient refuse treatment? A competent patient may decline any and all treatment. Even mentally ill patients are generally considered competent to refuse treatment. Physicians would be prudent to have a patient who has been diagnosed with mental illness and who refuses an apparently beneficial treatment evaluated by a psychiatrist. In some situations, patients can be compelled to receive treatment.\n\n【64】For example, a mentally ill patient could be considered a danger to society and institutionalized against his or her will.\n\n【65】Competent individuals with contagious diseases may refuse treatment, but public health officials may quarantine or involuntarily hospitalize and isolate them if they are dangerous to other people.\n\n【66】This policy is based on broad “police power” that states have (and can exercise through their departments of health) to protect the health and safety of the public. The reason for refusal of treatment can be rational or irrational. Whether rational or irrational, decisions are legally binding on the physician and the hospital. Individual freedom is guaranteed only if people are given the right to make choices that would generally be regarded as irrational behavior.\n\n【67】Some states also require hospitals to ensure proper consent is obtained for no treatment. This consent for no treatment should contain a release of medical responsibility and any associated liability for the hospital, nurses, and employees, together with all physicians connected in any way to the patient.\n\n【68】GOOD CLINICAL PRACTICE AND INFORMED CONSENT\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【69】Are good clinical practice and informed consent inseparable? Respect for patient autonomy in clinical practice is of great moral importance in our society. The moral and legal responsibility of medical informed consent depends on the transmission of appropriate information to patients. We believe patients' choices must not be coerced by members of the health care team or by other third parties, such as friends, family, or payers. Equally, we believe patients must be competent to consent; they must understand, remember, consider, and believe clinical information given to them about the specific treatments. The moral foundation for the requirement of medical informed consent in general is not disputed. The question arises whether in certain situations exceptions from the general requirement of medical informed consent would be acceptable. An exception to medical informed consent could be motivated by the idea that an exception is reasonable if insistence on the requirement of medical informed consent causes more harm than good.\n\n【70】INFORMED CONSENT IN EMERGENCIES\n-------------------------------\n\n【71】Is medical informed consent always necessary in emergency medical situations? Is a patient who is having an acute myocardial infarction sufficiently competent to understand what he or she is being told? In a survey of Swedish cardiologists about their perceptions of medical informed consent during acute myocardial infarction, 86% thought that patients were unable to comprehend all the information provided and so, by definition, were unable to give fully informed consent.\n\n【72】What evidence is there that patients with acute illnesses themselves fail to understand all the issues in the medical informed consent process? A report from the Fourth International Study of Infarct Survival revealed that only 31% of 129 patients perceived that they had full comprehension of the trial, and 19% thought they did not understand the trial.\n\n【73】Patient comprehension and reaction to participating in a double-blind randomized clinical trial (ISIS-4) in acute myocardial infarction.\n\n【74】A review of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage revealed only 19% of those who had given medical informed consent themselves could remember the consent process.\n\n【75】The studies suggest that during a medical emergency many of the patients were too ill to give fully informed consent. Does this mean that patients with an acute myocardial infarction or subarachnoid hemorrhage are unable to engage in the decision-making process of medical informed consent? The answer is no. Although acute myocardial infarction is a medical emergency and there is evidence that some patients do not fully comprehend all the information to make a fully informed decision, some patients do comprehend and are capable of doing so. A dialoguebetween the physician and patient is essential. This is a unique opportunity to involve appropriate family members or health care surrogates in decision making during emergencies. Patients do not need to stand alone in the patient-physician partnership.\n\n【76】THE PARADOX OF CHOICE\n---------------------\n\n【77】Responsibility for medical care has landed on the shoulders of patients with a resounding thud. Patients have the choice of telling physicians what to do in relation to health care decisions. The tone of medical practice has shifted from paternalistic to consultative, in which the physician lays the possibilities before the patient, with the potential pluses and minuses of each, and the patient makes a choice. This attitude has been well described by Atul Gawande: “Only a decade ago, doctors made the decisions, patients did what they were told. Doctors did not consult patients about their desires and priorities…. They were regarded as children: too fragile and simple minded to handle the truth, let alone make decisions.”\n\n【78】According to Gawande, _The Silent World of Doctor and Patient_ , by physician and ethicist Jay Katz, launched us into the era of autonomous patient choice. There is little doubt that this change in the decision-making paradigm has improved the quality of medical care generally. Yet no single paradigm fits all patients. Gawande suggests the shift in responsibility has gone too far: “The new orthodoxy about patient autonomy has a hard time acknowledging an awkward truth: patients frequently don't want the freedom that we've given them. That is, they're glad to have their autonomy respected, but the exercise of that autonomy means choosing sometimes to relinquish it.”\n\n【79】Gawande describes a family medical emergency where his newborn daughter stopped breathing, and the family rushed her to the emergency department. The physicians on duty asked Gawande if he wanted his daughter intubated. He said that he wanted the physicians to make that decision for him: the uncertainties were savage, and he did not want to bear the responsibility of making the wrong call.\n\n【80】Gawande did not want to have to live with the guilt of making the wrong call.\n\n【81】When it comes to medical treatment, patients see choice as a burden and a blessing. Physicians must evaluate each patient-physician relationship individually and identify the level of responsibility each party wants to assume in the decision-making process. This process must be documented in the medical record and must detail the assumed responsibilities of each partner in the patient-physician relationship. The art of medicine demands an ability to apply multiple paradigms to the decision-making process when guiding patients through complex medical decisions. This process requires empathy, time, mutual understanding, and courage.\n\n【82】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【83】Medical informed consent is essential to a true patient-physician relationship. Patients need to participate in the informed consent process to understand the risk-benefit relationship for the proposed treatment strategy; this understanding is essential because patients are often psychologically regressed secondary to the realization that they are confronting a life-preserving procedure. Physicians need to participate in the informed consent process to provide patients with the best treatment available by sharing decision making and limiting any potential for liability. Medical ethics, common law, and, in many states, codified statutory law  mandate the informed consent process. Physicians would be prudent to be knowledgeable in these areas of medical ethics, common law, and statutory law. Physicians would be prudent also to understand that the consent process is vital to the physician-patient relationship and that no single paradigm can define the ethical, medical, and legal approach a physician should undertake to achieve informed consent. The process should be individualized within the boundaries of the patient's desires for autonomy, thus reflecting true patient autonomy.\n\n【84】TABLE 3 Ideal Statute Outlining Physicians' Duty to Disclose\n\n| Information shall be supplied to the patient or the patient's guardian or legal surrogate before obtaining consent to a proposed medical or surgical treatment or a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure as followsDescribe condition to be treatedDescribe proposed treatment or procedureOutline intended and anticipated results of proposed treatment or procedureDescribe recognized alternative treatments or procedures, including the option of not using these treatments or proceduresDescribe recognized material risks of serious complications or mortality associated with the followingProposed treatment or procedureRecognized alternative treatments or proceduresNo treatment or procedureOutline recognized benefits of alternative treatments or procedures and risks of alternative treatmentsDisclosure of information and consent provided for in this statute shall not be required in certain conditionsEmergencies as defined by statuteWhen surgical or diagnostic procedure is generally recognized by reasonably prudent physicians not to involve a material risk to the patientWhen the patient, another person, or people authorized to give consent pursuant to this chapter make a request in writing that the information provided for in this Code section not be disclosedWhen prior consent has been obtained within 30 days of the surgical or diagnostic procedure as a part of a course of treatment for the patient's condition, complying with the requirements of this statute for the surgical or diagnostic procedure; provided, however, that if such consent is obtained in conjunction with the patient's admission to a hospital for the performance of such procedure, the consent shall be valid for 30 days from the date of admission or for the period the person is confined in the hospital for that purpose, whichever is greaterWhen the surgical or diagnostic procedure is unforeseen or is not known to be needed at the time consent is obtained, and the patient has consented to allow the responsible physician to make the decision concerning such procedure |\n| --- |", "index": 1357, "show": true, "start": 1357, "end": 1600, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:29:02", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:29:56", "cost": 53.761}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:36", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:29:56", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:29:02"}

Vera Peters: Pioneering Radiation Oncologist", "text": "【0】M. Vera Peters: Pioneering Radiation Oncologist\nMildred Vera Peters was born April 28, 1911, in the Thistledown neighborhood of Rexdale, Ontario, now a part of metropolitan Toronto. She attended a one-room school and grew up on a dairy farm, on which she milked cows and drove a tractor as a child. Her father, Charles, died suddenly in 1923, when she was 11 years old, and left her mother Rebecca Mair – a schoolteacher – with 7 children.\n\n【1】Following high school graduation at age 16, Peters enrolled at the University of Toronto and studied mathematics and physics. The following year, she transferred to the University of Toronto’s medical school – her 6 siblings pooled their earnings to help pay for her tuition – and graduated in 1934. She was one of 10 women out of a graduating class of 115 students, and by the time of graduation she was using her middle name, Vera. Her mother died in 1933, from metastatic breast cancer and did not get to see her graduate.\n\n【2】Following two years as a surgical resident at St. John’s Hospital in Toronto, she started working with Dr Gordon Richards, director of the Department of Radiology at the Toronto General Hospital — and later first president of the National Cancer Institute of Canada — who developed the first radiology training program in Canada in 1923, and had treated Peters’ mother. She began working with him as a trainee at the Ontario Radiotherapy Institute at Toronto General Hospital, and in 1937, became a member of his department.\n\n【3】At that time, Hodgkin lymphoma was considered incurable. However, by the 1940s, Dr Richards and a few other radiation specialists such as Dr René Gilbert of Geneva, Switzerland, had noticed there were a few patients with Hodgkin lymphoma who did not relapse after radiotherapy and thought that radiation could be curative. In 1947, Richards suggested that Dr Peters examine the records of previously treated patients to see how many long-term survivors there were. After collecting 247 lymphoma patients treated over the previous 2 decades, Peters reported 5- and 10-year overall survival rates of 50% and 35%, respectively, in a landmark paper in 1950. Dr Richards proudly saw Dr Peters present this work at a departmental conference. He died in 1949, from leukemia, which presumably was related to his many years of radiation exposure, and did not live to see the publication of Dr Peters’ work.\n\n【4】With no time during her busy clinical day, Dr Peters had written the paper in the evenings after dinner with her husband, schoolteacher Kenneth Lobb, and their two daughters, Sandy and Jenny. However, the medical community did not pay much attention to her findings until she published a follow-up paper in 1956, which was endorsed by an influential radiation oncologist Henry Kaplan of Stanford. Soon radiotherapy became the treatment of choice for localized Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n【5】Until the late 1970s, the preferred treatment of breast cancer was the radical mastectomy popularized by William Halsted at Johns Hopkins in the 1890s, which included surgical removal of the entire breast tissue and the axillary and sometimes supraclavicular lymph nodes, as well as the chest muscles. Robert McWhirter, a surgeon at the University of Edinburgh, had reported in 1948 that the 5- and 10-year survival for patients with breast cancer following simple mastectomy (ie, without removal of the chest muscles, and with less extensive nodal dissection) and radiation therapy was the same as that following a radical mastectomy, but less invasive approaches were not widely adopted.\n\n【6】In 1975, Dr Peters presented a large study of women in Toronto showing that local resection of the breast tumor (“lumpectomy”) plus radiation with preservation of the breast produced results comparable to those from mastectomy. Initially, there was considerable skepticism about her findings. However, eventually treatment of breast cancer changed markedly because of the work of Dr Peters and others, with disfiguring radical mastectomy falling out of favor and more conservative approaches now routinely used.\n\n【7】Dr Peters’ bibliography is modest in size, with 48 peer-reviewed publications, on which she was often the first author. She was described as a modest and unassuming individual who did not like to argue, which limited recognition of her research accomplishments. However, her clinical and research skills were widely appreciated in Toronto. Among her most satisfying invited lectureships were the 1968 Gordon Richards Memorial Lecture of the Canadian Association of Radiologists, and her Royal College lecture, which she entitled “Cutting the Gordian Knot in Early Breast Cancer.”\n\n【8】She had worked in the Ontario Institute of Radiotherapy, which after 1958 became part of the Ontario Cancer Institute and the Princess Margaret Hospital. She retired at 65 years of age in 1976, and subsequently had a part-time consulting practice in Oakville, a suburb of Toronto. The last three months of her life was spent as a patient in the Princess Margaret Hospital, where she died of metastatic cancer on October 1, 1993, at age 82.\n\n【9】Dr Peters became a member and subsequently officer of the Order of Canada. She also received the Gold Medal of the American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO), and received honorary doctoral degrees from York University in Toronto and Queens University in Kingston, Ontario. She accomplished her groundbreaking achievements at a time when few women had leadership roles in medical advances or were elected as leaders of scientific societies. One female radiation oncologist in Toronto said that, “She left footprints in the snow for us to follow.”\n\n【10】Dr Peters met her husband-to-be when she was a medical student, while working as a waitress on a two-day cruise on Lake Ontario back and forth between Toronto and Kingston, Ontario. Her husband died in 1967. One of their two daughters became an internist.\n\n【11】Dr Peters is remembered for her caring, compassionate, and sensitive approach for each patient. Her warmth combined with an air of competence, confidence, and hope characterized her approach to patients.

Her condition quickly deteriorated into cardiogenic shock with ventricular arrhythmia. Despite revascularization of the left anterior descending artery and intravenous inotrope and antiarrhythmic therapy, her unstable hemodynamics and arrhythmias persisted. Early emergency initiation of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) led to prompt hemodynamic and rhythm stability; however, adequate endogenous cardiac output did not ensue, and she was not able to be weaned from ECMO until hospital day 8. She subsequently recovered and continues to do well in the outpatient setting. This case demonstrates the remarkable hemodynamic and rhythm stability that early initiation of ECMO can provide in the setting of unstable myocardial infarction.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CPR ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation ), ECMO ( extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ), IABP ( intra-aortic balloon pump ), LAD ( left anterior descending ), LM ( left main ), MI ( myocardial infarction )\n\n【4】During acute myocardial infarction (MI), cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias may persist despite revascularization and maximal medical and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. We present the case of a woman with ST-elevation MI who, despite successful and prompt percutaneous intervention, continued to remain electrically and hemodynamically unstable despite repeated defibrillation, intravenous antiarrhythmic inotropic drugs, and use of an IABP. Emergency establishment of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) led to immediate electrical and hemodynamic improvement with subsequent patient survival and recovery. From this experience, we demonstrate that ECMO can be a lifesaving approach in the catheterization laboratory for emergency treatment of patients with cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias due to acute MI; thus, ECMO should be considered early during resuscitation.\n\n【5】Report of a Case\n----------------\n\n【6】A previously healthy 46-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 28-hour history of acute-onset chest pressure and dyspnea. She appeared severely distressed, with ongoing chest pain, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis. Her vital signs included a blood pressure of 129/96 mm Hg, heart rate of 124 beats/min, and respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min.\n\n【7】Her electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia with ST elevation in leads V <sub>3 </sub> through V <sub>6 </sub> , II, III, and aVF suggestive of anterior, anterolateral, and inferior myocardial injury . Her baseline electrical activity was unstable, and an electrocardiogram 4 minutes later demonstrated nonsustained ventricular tachycardia . Her initial troponin T level was 0.95 ng/mL (reference range, <0.01 ng/mL \\[to convert to μg/L, multiply by 1\\]).\n\n【8】She was diagnosed as having an ST-elevation MI and referred for emergency coronary angiography after the administration of oral aspirin, oral clopidogrel, and intravenous unfractionated heparin.\n\n【9】Figure 1 A, Electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation showing sinus tachycardia with ST elevation in leads V <sub>3 </sub> through V <sub>6 </sub> , II, III, and aVF suggestive of anterior, anterolateral, and inferior myocardial injury. B, An ECG 4 minutes after the initial ECG, showing rhythm instability and ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【10】On arrival in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, the patient experienced ventricular fibrillation and required cardiac defibrillation, tracheal intubation, and controlled ventilation with 100% oxygen. Left coronary angiography revealed mobile thrombus in the left main (LM) coronary artery, 100% ostial occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, and thrombus embolization into the circumflex artery . The LM and LAD arteries were treated with aspiration thrombectomy and angioplasty with restoration of perfusion to the LM and mid-LAD arteries . Intravenous eptifibatide therapy was also initiated during the intervention to maximize platelet inhibition.\n\n【11】Figure 2 Right anterior oblique caudal view of the left coronary system with thrombus noted in the distal left main artery (arrow), and an occluded left anterior descending artery and thrombus in the obtuse marginal branch of the circumflex artery (hatched arrow).\n\n【12】Figure 3 Right anterior oblique cranial view of the left coronary system with an intracoronary wire placed in the previously occluded left anterior descending artery and improved perfusion.\n\n【13】Throughout the procedure, the patient required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for recurrent cardiac arrest and received a total of 10 shocks for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Adequacy of chest compressions throughout the resuscitation were assessed by arterial waveforms monitored via a catheter in the right femoral artery. To prevent fatigue while performing CPR, causing a deterioration in CPR efficacy, chest compressors were changed at 2-minute intervals during brief rhythm analysis or when chest compression cadence decreased below 100/min. The patient's profound electrical and hemodynamic instability persisted despite administration of amiodarone, vasopressin, intravenous epinephrine, and the placement of an IABP. Severe pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema, as evidenced in the anesthesia circuit, contributed to her persistent hypoxemia.\n\n【14】Advanced percutaneous left ventricular assist devices were considered for circulatory support but not used out of concern that they might not have provided the immediate improvement in oxygenation or increase in cardiac output necessary to protect neurologic and myocardial viability. Instead, a venoarterial ECMO system was placed via the right femoral artery and vein. The vein was cannulated with a 25F cannula that extended into the right atrium, and the artery was cannulated with a 17F cannula. Serial vascular dilators were used to enable percutaneous placement of these large-caliber cannulas. Immediate pre-ECMO arterial blood analysis revealed a pH of 6.82 and a base deficit of less than −25 mmol/L. Initiation of ECMO led to immediate electrical and hemodynamic stability, and no further CPR was required. However, IABP support was continued to improve diastolic perfusion of the coronary arteries. Initial echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%. Figure 4 demonstrates the documented course of events from arrival in the catheterization laboratory.\n\n【15】Figure 4 Timeline of events after the patient's arrival to the catheterization laboratory (cath lab). CPR = cardiopulmonary resuscitation; ECMO = extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; IABP = intra-aortic balloon pump.\n\n【16】The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit, cooled to 34°C for 24 hours, and maintained on ECMO at a cardiac index of 1.8 to 2.0. She demonstrated progressive neurologic recovery and awoke at 24 hours. Her hemodynamics improved during the subsequent week but not enough that ECMO could be discontinued. Her peak creatine kinase–MB level was 358 ng/mL (reference range, <3.8 ng/mL) (to convert to μg/L, multiply by 1), and her peak troponin level was 12.6 ng/mL. She was successfully weaned from ECMO on day 8, and low-dose epinephrine and vasopressin were continued as intravenous infusions. She had minimal bleeding but no other ECMO-associated complications. The IABP was continued while she was receiving ECMO to increase blood flow to the coronary arteries and brain and to counteract the increased afterload effects of ECMO. The IABP was removed on day 9, and she was extubated soon after. Her subsequent hospital course was complicated by a pulmonary embolism and splenic vein thrombosis. Gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of a thrombotic mass in her ascending colon necessitated a partial colectomy with benign disease documented on pathology. Dilation and curettage were also performed for endometrial thickening. Thrombophilia and hematology evaluation suggested that she had an acquired thrombophilia due to thrombocytosis secondary to iron deficiency anemia. We speculate that her coronary thrombi were likely formed at the site of an unstable atherosclerotic lesion in the ostium of the LAD artery, with fragments subsequently embolizing within the circumflex artery. She was discharged from the hospital 30 days after her MI with intact neurologic status, and she continues to do well as an outpatient (last assessed in January 2013). At her last echocardiogram evaluation 2 months after her event, the left ventricular ejection fraction was 30% to 35%.\n\n【17】Discussion\n----------\n\n【18】Cardiogenic shock related to ongoing MI that persists despite revascularization may lead to subsequent multiorgan failure. Injured myocardium may retain substantial viability after successful revascularization, but functional recovery often lags by several days, thereby necessitating extrinsic hemodynamic support. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines recommend placement of an IABP in the setting of cardiogenic shock or ischemia-related intractable ventricular arrhythmias (Class IIa, Level of Evidence of B).\n\n【19】ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction—executive summary: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to Revise the 1999 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction).\n\n【20】However, in the patient we described, pharmacologic therapy and insertion of an IABP failed to resolve the life-threatening, persistent cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias after coronary revascularization. Instead, we relied on ECMO as a bridge therapy to sustain hemodynamics until the patient’s heart fully recovered. This case is unique in that ECMO was considered early and initiated effectively in the catheterization laboratory, resulting in immediate hemodynamic and rhythm stability. Given the severity of metabolic abnormality, the degree of hypoxemia with fulminant pulmonary edema, and the prolonged duration of CPR, one would not have predicted whether a full recovery was possible, and termination of resuscitation would have been justified. Our experience with the inadequacy of the IABP support is consistent with the recent Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock (SHOCK) II trial, which failed to demonstrate significant reduction in 30-day mortality in patients with acute MI and cardiogenic shock treated with an IABP placement.\n\n【21】Intraaortic balloon support for myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock.\n\n【22】Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can provide oxygenation and circulatory support and may have a distinct advantage over purely hemodynamic support devices, especially in the setting of persistent hypoxemia and severely reduced cardiac function. Although data are limited regarding its utility in acute MI and cardiogenic shock, smaller studies have indicated a potential benefit. One single-center, retrospective series of 33 patients who received ECMO support in the setting of persistent cardiogenic shock, despite the use of vasopressors and IABP placement, suggested improved survival compared with 25 patients with similar clinical characteristics treated with IABP alone.\n\n【23】Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-assisted primary percutaneous coronary intervention may improve survival of patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by profound cardiogenic shock.\n\n【24】There is also evidence of improved 30-day survival in patients presenting in severe shock during MI, with a 33% absolute risk reduction and a 45.8% relative risk reduction of death associated with ECMO therapy.\n\n【25】Early extracorporeal membrane oxygenator-assisted primary percutaneous coronary intervention improved 30-day clinical outcomes in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction complicated with profound cardiogenic shock.\n\n【26】Another single-center, retrospective study of 98 patients receiving extracorporeal life support for cardiogenic shock during acute coronary artery syndrome found that 32.7% survived to hospital dismissal. This study included 41 patients who had pulseless electrical activity and/or asystole, which seemed to be an independent indicator of inpatient mortality.\n\n【27】In a study of 35 patients, ECMO benefit did not differ among revascularization strategy (percutaneous intervention vs coronary bypass).\n\n【28】Overall, these are small studies with multiple confounders, but they indicate the potential value of ECMO support in patients with unstable acute coronary syndrome.\n\n【29】In the United States specifically, ECMO has been used on a limited basis for supporting adults. According to the International Extracorporeal Life Support Organization, the only reporting registry for ECMO, 876 US adults who received extracorporeal CPR within the past 20 years (without accounting for cardiogenic shock) had a 26% survival. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for pure cardiac support was used in 709 adult patients documented in 2012, with an overall survival of 39%.\n\n【30】Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is still of limited use throughout the world for cardiac support in adults and even less for adult extracorporeal CPR. Nonetheless, its use is becoming more frequent and is potentially lifesaving, such as in this patient.\n\n【31】Likewise, data are limited regarding other percutaneously placed left ventricular assist devices, such as Impella (Abiomed, Inc) or TandemHeart (CardiacAssist, Inc). In one randomized trial comparing 12 patients treated with Impella to 13 patients treated with IABP, the improvement in the cardiac index was greater in the Impella group, but the 30-day mortality remained the same for both groups.\n\n【32】A randomized clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a percutaneous left ventricular assist device versus intra-aortic balloon pumping for treatment of cardiogenic shock caused by myocardial infarction.\n\n【33】Similarly, a meta-analysis of 3 studies that compared IABP to percutaneous left ventricular assist devices (TandemHeart or Impella) failed to demonstrate improvement in 30-day mortality for patients in cardiogenic shock. Although the hemodynamics improved with the 2 left ventricular assist devices, there was a greater risk of bleeding with TandemHeart and higher levels of observed hemolysis with Impella.\n\n【34】Percutaneous left ventricular assist devices vs. intra-aortic balloon pump counterpulsation for treatment of cardiogenic shock: a meta-analysis of controlled trials.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【36】This case demonstrates the value of venoarterial ECMO in the setting of cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias precipitated by an acute MI. In our case, ECMO resolved the patient's ventricular arrhythmia and stabilized her hemodynamics until cardiac recovery. At 4 months after MI, the patient was asymptomatic and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% to 35%. When available in the catheterization laboratory for emergency use, ECMO may serve as an ancillary lifesaving measure for patients with cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of an acute MI. Moreover, it should be considered early during the resuscitative efforts to optimize potential benefit, including the stabilization of arrhythmias and limiting additional organ injury.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:38:09", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:38:55", "cost": 46.133}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:35", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:38:54", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:38:08"}

This occurred 10 weeks after China reported to the WHO a cluster of pneumonia cases. In the context of a pandemic, multiple pressures, such as fear of death and economic collapse, may align. This scenario creates a fertile ground for ingrained cognitive biases, thereby disturbing the systematic approach upon which science usually relies.\n\n【1】The senior author of the first published clinical study on the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 had stated in an interview with French newspaper _Le Monde_ that “doctors can and should think like doctors, not like methodologists.”\n\n【2】Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as a treatment of COVID-19: results of an open-label non-randomized clinical trial.\n\n【3】This study attracted attention and exerted influence after the release of its promising results.

Within this context, science and clinical research have been creating rigorous methodological standards in order to produce high-quality studies that allow us to have greater confidence in the evidence while mitigating unnecessary damage.\n\n【9】Contrary to what was once largely accepted as a normative model, human beings are not usually rational in their decision-making processes, often relying on many heuristics that may have afforded an evolutionary compensation and adaptation for our limited computational capacity. Take, for example, our inclination to search for evidence that confirms our prior beliefs, a tendency known as confirmation bias. We are naturally prone to this sort of intellectual ambush, and there is evidence to support that scientists are not immune to these systematic errors.\n\n【10】For a group of people, once a belief is incorporated, even strong evidence contrary to such belief is not enough for a reinterpretation, a mechanism named belief perseveration. In the extreme case, exposing people to proof that is inconsistent to their understanding might lead them to reject the opposing hypothesis even more strongly, what has been called the backfire effect. For instance, among people highly concerned about vaccine side effects, receiving information about vaccines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reduced their intent on vaccinating.\n\n【11】In a time urging for cost-effective results, it is important to make a clear distinction between scientific method and scientists. The former is the enterprise that aims to diminish systematic error; the latter is reasonably susceptible for all sorts of biases when not following a systematic approach.\n\n【12】When low-quality studies are created, the risk of misinterpretation increases. In the setting of a highly connected world and increasing public exposure, there might be a temptation for researchers to report the results of their findings in an incorrect way, either highlighting benefits or downplaying the harms of a specific treatment. This is called the “spin” of reporting clinical research.\n\n【13】Since “spin” is highly prevalent in the medical literature,\n\n【14】one might speculate on the motivations behind it. In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, this seems to be mostly driven by an intrinsic desire to find a treatment that works against a disease that is having an important impact on society across the world. However, other motivations include lack of knowledge about methodological standards, opportunistic publishing, and an intent to influence readers.\n\n【15】A new classification of spin in systematic reviews and meta-analyses was developed and ranked according to the severity.\n\n【16】Studies evaluating the impact of “spin” have shown that clinicians are more likely to perceive a treatment as beneficial when “spin” is present.\n\n【17】The general public may be more susceptible to be influenced by “spin”, especially if they lack the expertise to avoid misinterpretation of research data. This issue could be amplified by the Dunning-Kruger effect, a cognitive bias in which unskilled individuals tend to overestimate their ability in a given task.\n\n【18】During the COVID-19 pandemic, the early adoption of new interventions by clinicians and policy makers based on promising but often low-quality data is creating a scenario from which anecdotal evidence may emerge. Several countries have endorsed the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 in clinical scenarios outside of the undergoing research protocols. As an example, Brazil’s Ministry of Health has released a new treatment guideline for COVID-19 recommending the use of either hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for patients with mild symptoms, such as cough, fatigue, anosmia, or headache,\n\n【19】ignoring current best evidence. This off-label use allows for claims of efficacy based on informal reports of patients who recovered from the disease after taking the medication, adding an important layer of confusion and misinterpretation. Anecdotal evidence is more likely to emerge from this mild spectrum in which drug efficacy is easily confounded with the natural course of the disease that would otherwise improve with supportive care only.\n\n【20】The belief that hydroxychloroquine might be a good intervention for COVID-19 led to the hoarding of this medication by the general public and health care workers around the world. This scenario created an uncertainty about drug availability to patients who need this medication, especially for those with rheumatologic diseases and in low-to-middle income countries with high rates of malaria.\n\n【21】Despite being arguably the lowest quality of scientific proof, there are several reasons to believe that anecdotal evidence, in particular, may be accorded more credence than such evidence truly merits. First, there is a narrative quality to anecdotal evidence that resonates with intuitive patterns of learning. Second, the context in which this sort of information is shared usually involves a known person, which might add an affective valence to the message. Finally, there is the availability heuristics, which leads people to misjudge the probability of an event being true based on how easily it can be recalled.\n\n【22】We emphasize the importance of interrupting the “flexibilization” of science in order to break a vicious cycle that may do more harm than good. While fast-paced clinical studies need to be done during a global crisis, they need to follow methodological standards in order to produce reliable and high-quality evidence. The administrative bureaucracy and procedures to perform a well-designed randomized controlled trial, for example, can be accelerated, but the pandemic should not be an excuse to overlook important aspects of methodological standards. In the era of COVID-19, we need to be even more vigilant about our own cognitive biases and limitations, and avoid the “flexibilization” of science as this may exert significant harm to our society.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:24:26", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:24:49", "cost": 22.805}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:35", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:24:49", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:24:26"}

But the antibacterial activity of penicillin was first discovered decades before Fleming's or Florey's work. Ernest A.C. Duchesne, a young military physician in Lyons, France, discovered penicillin in 1897 during a thesis project investigating antagonism between bacteria and fungi.

In addition, they describe the commonly used approach to anesthesia for RFA—perithyroidal lidocaine injection—and suggest that general anesthesia, as used by us, would not allow monitoring of voice changes during the procedure. To that point they argue that local anesthesia is a safe pain control method that allows voice monitoring and quote\n\n【3】Korean Society of Thyroid Radiology  \nComplications encountered in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules with US-guided radiofrequency ablation: a multicenter study.\n\n【4】“only 1% of voice-related complications during RFA of benign nodules” when local anesthesia was used. First, we want to point out that we had no voice-related complications with our approach beyond the periprocedure recovery changes. For safety reasons, we have purposefully left untreated the outer 5 mm of the nodule. This has not been the case with previous RFA protocols. We chose this safety margin because we wanted the complication rate as close to 0 as possible and this has allowed us to treat the nodules safely without continuous monitoring of voice in a patient under anesthesia. Of course, the volume reduction is less, but we think it is worth the added safety benefit. Second, it is pertinent that we dealt with rather large nodules that require an extensive procedure time. For some nodules the patient positioning required for adequately reaching the target nodule is not a very natural one. In this scenario, eliminating patients' anxiety and movement was beneficial for achieving optimal control of the treated area and minimizing risk to adjacent structures. Third, as the submitted commentary points out, “pain during RFA is tolerable in most patients only using perithyroidal lidocaine injection,” which actually underlines the possibility that for some subjects pain will be an issue with local anesthesia and that could lead to discomfort and more so to undesirable movement during the procedure. In response to this issue, we think that there is a role for both approaches to anesthesia, the ultimate selection depending on the size and location of the target lesion as well as the comfort level of the procedural team with the different approaches. The third issue that Park and Jung bring up relates to the comparison between single-session and multisession RFA. We actually did not perform repeat RFA in our study because it was intended to be a small feasibility pilot study. We do agree with their commentary that repeat RFA is likely to achieve further decrease in nodule volume and, in some cases, avoid the need for surgery. However, in most cases, our goal was symptom relief as opposed to maximum volume reduction. With that goal achieved we would consider re-treatment if the nodule regrows and/or is symptomatic. For further research we think that it will be important to identify factors associated with nodule regrowth to properly counsel patients for repeat RFA, while conversely eliminating the need for repeat procedures in those who are very likely to do well after single-session RFA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:31:16", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:31:36", "cost": 20.275}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:35", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:31:37", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:31:15"}

Participants were instructed to self-collect both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, which were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction–based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay between May 8, 2020, and June, 30, 2020. We assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and characteristics of study subjects.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 1505 eligible subjects participated in the study whose mean age was 68 years, with 885 (59%) women, 32 (2%) racial/ethnic minorities, and 906 (60%) with high-risk conditions for influenza. The prevalence of other Coronaviridae (human coronavirus \\[HCoV\\]-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) during the 2019 to 2020 flu season was 109 (7%), and _none_ tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. _Almost all participants_ reported adhering to the RPHM (1,488 \\[99%\\] for social distancing, 1,438 \\[96%\\] for wearing mask in a public space, 1,476 \\[98%\\] for hand hygiene, and 1,441 (96%) for staying home mostly). Eighty-six percent of participants resided in a single-family home.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】We did not identify SARS-COV-2 infection in our study cohort.

For example, the orders were associated with a 30% to 49% reduction of cases and a 60% reduction of COVID-19–related deaths during the first 3 weeks of issuance of the orders,\n\n【17】and this is true for the state of Minnesota.\n\n【18】As the states lifted the stay-at-home orders, resurgence of COVID-19 was observed at a national level.\n\n【19】删除21:<u>In the state of Minnesota, the stay-at-home order was enforced from March 27, 2020, through May 18, 2020.</u>\n\n【20】To date, no community-based population surveillance studies have assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 after the stay-at-home orders were lifted in a well-defined population in a mixed rural-urban setting of the United States. In addition, few studies assessed the influence of adherence to the recommended public health measures and social determinants of health (SDH) as factors characterizing COVID-19 cases and healthy individuals in the community. For example, a meta-analysis, which compiled 44 studies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus primarily in health care settings, reported that adhering to the recommended public health measures including physical distancing, masks, and eye protection reduced the risk of transmission of COVID-19, SARS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.\n\n【21】However, none of these studies assessed such effects in the community. Also, although environmental conditions and SDH have been reported to be one of the major risk factors for the transmission of COVID-19 in the community,\n\n【22】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【23】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【26】little is known about the role of SDH in the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the community.\n\n【27】Therefore, we assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and characteristics of study subjects in a community-based sample of adults 50 years and older residing in southeast Minnesota (SEMN) via community-based population surveillance during a period when restrictions for the stay-at-home order were being lifted.\n\n【28】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【29】The ongoing parent study assessing a viral infection was designed to follow adults 50 years and older residing in SEMN between October 2019 and April 2021. According to US census data in 2010, the age, sex, and ethnic characteristics of Olmsted County residents (89% of the study subjects) were similar to those of the state of Minnesota and the Upper Midwest\n\n【30】Study Group on Heterogeneity of HIV Epidemics in African Cities.

We enrolled patients paneled in the primary care practice of Mayo Clinic's campus in Rochester, Minnesota. For this study, we identified all individuals who resided in SEMN (largely from 4 counties including Olmsted, Dodge, Wabasha, and Goodhue) on April 1, 2019, by using electronic health records.\n\n【32】The first COVID-19 case in Olmsted County was reported on March 11, 2020. As of July 1, 2020 (at the end of our present study between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020), the total number of COVID-19 cases were 37,210 in the state of Minnesota, 1076 in Olmsted (a population of 158,293), 83 in Dodge (a population of 20,934), 31 in Wabasha (a population of 21,627), and 127 in Goodhue (a population of 46,340) counties. The virus circulation remained relatively constant over the study period in the counties. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.\n\n【33】The study was designed as a cross-sectional study nested in a parent prospective cohort study, which enrolled a population-based sample of adults 50 years and older residing in SEMN and represents a stratified random sample by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the parent study can be found in the Supplemental Material . Subjects who agreed to participate in the present study were screened for COVID-19 symptoms and then were instructed to self-collect swabs (regardless of COVID-19 symptoms) of both the anterior nares and oropharynx (throat) using packaged testing kits distributed to consented participants between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Specimens were returned to the performing laboratory by a prearranged courier service within 24 hours for testing for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The study aims were to assess the prevalence and characteristics of COVID-19 cases on the basis of symptom status via a questionnaire survey completed by the participants at the time of swab collection. The institutional process for handling positive cases of COVID-19 was to be activated for positive results.\n\n【34】### Assessment of Exposure to and Symptoms of COVID-19 by a Survey at the Time of Testing\n\n【35】We established detailed exposure and symptom screening algorithms on the basis of the institutionally recommended guidelines derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\n【36】### Instructions for Self-collecting Swabs of Anterior Nares and Oropharynx\n\n【37】We developed instructions and workflow for self-collecting swabs of anterior nares and oropharynx  as reported by others.\n\n【38】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【39】Comparison of unsupervised home self-collected midnasal swabs with clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【40】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【41】Assessment of sensitivity and specificity of patient-collected lower nasal specimens for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing .\n\n【42】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【43】Swabs collected by patients or health care workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing.\n\n【44】The concordance rates for positive PCR test results for both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus between swabs performed by research staff and self-swabs were 99% (95% CI, 94% to 100%) in our parent study (N=98).\n\n【45】### Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Testing\n\n【46】Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions for the real-time reverse transcription PCR–based cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) that has received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. This assay detects the SARS-CoV-2 _ORF1ab_ and _E_ gene sequences, and test results were reported as target detected, target not detected, presumptive positive (when only the _E_ gene sequence was detected), or inconclusive (when PCR inhibition was present).\n\n【47】### Other Pertinent Variables\n\n【48】We also collected both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs in the same fashion as described above during the flu season (from November 1, 2019, through April 30, 2020) when our parent study cohort developed acute respiratory illnesses .\n\n【49】### Data Analyses\n\n【50】We collated descriptive statistics summarizing characteristics of study subjects.

Of the 2325 adults who participated in the parent study, 1508 participated in this present study and 3 subjects were excluded as 2 subjects did not have reverse transcription PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 subject had missing survey data. There were no marked differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between those who participated and those who did not (data not shown). The mean age of subjects was 68±9.6 years, and women were represented by 59%. Although minority subjects (32 \\[2%\\]) were underrepresented in our study, 313 (21%) were rural residents, 566 (43%) were those with less than 4-year college education, 536 (38%) were those with SES below the median of our study population, 514 (35%) were current or former smokers, and 906 (60%) were those who had high-risk comorbidities for influenza (also for COVID-19).\n\n【54】Table 1 Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Study Participants (N=1505)\n\n【55】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【56】BMI, body mass index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HOUSES, Housing-based Socioeconomic Index; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【57】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【58】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【59】Data are presented as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n| Characteristic | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR | 0 (0) |\n| Age at the time of testing (y) | 68 ± 9.6 |\n| Sex |  |\n| Female | 885 (58.8) |\n| Male | 620 (41.2) |\n| Race/ethnicity |  |\n| American Indian/Alaskan Native | 4 (0.3) |\n| Asian | 11 (0.7) |\n| Black | 6 (0.4) |\n| Hispanic or Latino | 11 (0.7) |\n| Non-Hispanic white | 1457 (96.8) |\n| Unknown | 16 (1.1) |\n| Rurality |  |\n| Living in rural area | 312 (20.7) |\n| Living in urban area | 1193 (79.2) |\n| Socioeconomic status (HOUSES index in quartile) |  |\n| 1 (lowest) | 174 (12.3) |\n| 2 | 362 (25.5) |\n| 3 | 402 (28.3) |\n| 4 (highest) | 482 (33.9) |\n| Missing | 85 (5.6) |\n| Education level |  |\n| High school or less | 139 (10.6) |\n| Some college | 427 (32.4) |\n| Four year college graduate | 406 (30.8) |\n| Graduate or professional school | 345 (26.2) |\n| Missing | 188 (12.5) |\n| Smoking status |  |\n| Never | 951 (64.9) |\n| Former | 477 (32.6) |\n| Current | 37 (2.5) |\n| Missing | 40 (2.7) |\n| Chronic illnesscChronic illnesses were defined using electronic health records within 1 y of enrollment in the parent study. |  |\n| Any conditions | 908 (60.3) |\n| Hypertension | 576 (38.3) |\n| Coronary heart disease | 23 (1.5) |\n| Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) 72 (4.8) |  |\n| Chronic kidney diseases | 119 (7.9) |\n| Chronic liver diseases | 32 (2.1) |\n| Immune suppressive conditions | 70 (4.7) |\n| Malignant tumor | 212 (14.1) |\n| Congestive heart failure | 44 (2.9) |\n| Asthma | 118 (7.8) |\n| Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | 70 (4.7) |\n| Any other heart or lung disease | 304 (20.2) |\n| Diabetes mellitus | 164 (10.9) |\n\n【61】a BMI, body mass index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HOUSES, Housing-based Socioeconomic Index; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【62】b Data are presented as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n【63】c Chronic illnesses were defined using electronic health records within 1 y of enrollment in the parent study.\n\n【64】### Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Study Subjects\n\n【65】Characteristics of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 cases at the time of testing for SARS-CoV-2 are summarized in Table 2 . Only 28 (2%) study subjects reported being exposed to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time of testing, and most exposures were outside the household (27 \\[96%\\]). One hundred sixty subjects (11%) reported to have at least 1 clinical symptom at the time of testing. One hundred thirty nine participants (9%) were health care workers and 12% had traveled outside Minnesota.

For this unexpected study result, given the multiple individual risk factors (eg, prevalent comorbidities and older age) for COVID-19 in our study subjects, we focused our analyses on identifying factors potentially mitigating the risk of transmitting COVID-19, which may have led to a significant reduction in the burden of COVID-19 cases in our study subjects and community.

One hundred nine (7%) had infections by 1 or more seasonal coronaviruses—HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43—during the flu season (October through April), and 7% had influenza A or B. Influenza vaccination within 1 year before enrollment in the parent study and pneumococcal vaccination ever before enrollment in the parent study were 452 (30%) and 803 (53%), respectively.\n\n【98】Discussion\n----------\n\n【99】To our knowledge, this is the first community-based population surveillance study in a well-defined population after the stay-at-home order was lifted, which comprehensively characterized the study population using clinical, virological, and behavioral data in the United States. Our results indicated that although the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43) in our study cohort (7%) was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season, there were _no COVID-19 cases_ among the 1505 study participants during the study period (between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020). Despite the large proportion of study subjects affected by risk factors for COVID-19 (eg, high-risk comorbidities for influenza and older age), _almost all subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures and 86% of participants resided in a single family housing units instead of high-density housing units (eg, apartments). Although our study results were unexpected and did not have a comparative reference group, they nonetheless provide an important insight into the characteristics of a population protected from COVID-19, where such protection is potentially rooted in adherence to public health recommendations and thus would support the current public health recommendations to be more fully implemented at the community, state, and national levels.\n\n【100】Our study results are unexpected given the reported prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in various study settings including the community. For example, 2 community-based population surveillance studies, which are similar to our study, reported the prevalence of COVID-19 (13 \\[0.6%\\] in a random sample of 2283 residents in Iceland \\[April 1-4\\]\n\n【101】Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic population.\n\n【102】and 1.2% in a sample of 2343 residents of Vo (out of 3275) in Italy \\[February 23-March 8\\]\n\n【103】10.1038/s41586-020-2956-7\\].\n\n【104】) and asymptomatic COVID-19 (7 of 13 \\[54%\\] in the Iceland study and 30 of 73 \\[41%\\] in the Italian study at the time of testing). As our study results were based on self-swab at home, one might be concerned about systematic performance biases (from subject’s specimen collection) leading to potential false negativity. However, during our study, the concordance rates for both respiratory syncytial virus and influenza between self-swab and swab by research staff were 99%. In addition, although it is not part of the present report, our ongoing work assessing the prevalence of COVID-19 during the flu season using the same processes and methods as the present study indeed found a positive case, suggesting that our study findings are unlikely to be due to performance biases or errors leading to false negativity.\n\n【105】Although our study participants overrepresented the White race as a protective factor for COVID-19 raising a selection bias, it is unlikely to account for our study finding. For example, the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections in our study cohort  was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season.\n\n【106】The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System by US laboratories (117 laboratories reported 854,575 HCoV tests) from July 2014 through June 2017 (ie, pre–COVID-19 pandemic) reported that 2.2% were positive for HCoV-OC43, 1.0% for HCoV-NL63, 0.8% for HCoV-229E, and 0.6% for HCoV-HKU1.\n\n【107】Also, the prevalence of influenza in our study participants during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7% whereas that of an older cohort _during the pre-COVID-19 pandemic was 7%_ .\n\n【108】Our study subjects exhibited a high health care worker rate (9%), which may mean a potentially higher chance of contacting people including patients as essential workers, but also they might have had better personal protective equipment, of which the net effects are unknown but presumably higher for COVID-19.\n\n【109】Our study results provide guidance to communities in terms of how to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\n\n【110】First, as shown in Table 1 , our study cohort encompasses population features representing both reported protective (eg, predominant White race and higher proportion of women) and risk (eg, high frequency of high-risk comorbidities and older age) factors for COVID-19. Apart from these nonmodifiable risk and protective factors, our study results indicated that _almost all study subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures for COVID-19, as shown in Table 3 . The literature suggested that only about 70% to 90% of people followed social distancing policy, depending on age.\n\n【111】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【112】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【113】What protective health measures are Americans taking in response to COVID-19?

Given the current unnecessary skepticism and controversies over current public health recommendations to preventing transmissibility of COVID-19, our study findings based on subjects who were protected from COVID-19 should provide guidance and reinforcement for following the recommended simple public health measures at the community, state, and national levels, as found in recent reports.\n\n【123】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【124】The effect of large-scale anti-contagion policies on the COVID-19 pandemic .\n\n【125】Second, as shown in Table 2 , 86% of our study subjects resided in single family housing units, which is higher than the national average single family homeownership rate (68% in 2020)\n\n【126】and could be another important factor mitigating the risk of COVID-19 as one of the important risk factors for COVID-19 is crowded residential units.\n\n【127】Associations between built environment, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women in New York City.\n\n【128】This finding highlights the importance of at least 1 social determinant of health, such as housing or even arranging a temporary place for isolation or quarantine of the affected family members for those living in crowded residential units (eg, apartments) beyond testing and tracing to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmissibility in the community.\n\n【129】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【130】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【131】Third, as shown in Table 4 , among our study subjects, 8% had seasonal coronavirus infections (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) during the past flu season (October 2019 through April 2020).

However, we believe that the present single group analysis still provides a valuable insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19 without including an arbitrary reference group. The community prevalence of COVID-19 in this setting is relatively low compared with the national level (68 per 1,000,000 vs 847 per 1,000,000 as of July 1, 2020), so the results may not be generalizable to other study settings. Desirability bias through phone interview might have played a role in the high percentage of adhering to public health measures, although it is unlikely.\n\n【143】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【144】Although the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections in our study cohort (7%) was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season, we did not observe subjects in this cohort testing positive for COVID-19. The combination of participants’ behavior in following the recommended public health measures and a social determinant of health, such as access to a single family housing, may significantly mitigate the risk of COVID-19.

We assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and characteristics of study subjects.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 1505 eligible subjects participated in the study whose mean age was 68 years, with 885 (59%) women, 32 (2%) racial/ethnic minorities, and 906 (60%) with high-risk conditions for influenza. The prevalence of other Coronaviridae (human coronavirus \\[HCoV\\]-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) during the 2019 to 2020 flu season was 109 (7%), and _none_ tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. _Almost all participants_ reported adhering to the RPHM (1,488 \\[99%\\] for social distancing, 1,438 \\[96%\\] for wearing mask in a public space, 1,476 \\[98%\\] for hand hygiene, and 1,441 (96%) for staying home mostly). Eighty-six percent of participants resided in a single-family home.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】We did not identify SARS-COV-2 infection in our study cohort. The combination of participants’ behavior in following the RPHM and their living environment may considerably mitigate the risk of COVID-19.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】COVID-19 ( coronavirus disease 2019 ), HCoV ( human coronavirus ), PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ), RPHM ( recommended public health measures ), SARS-CoV-2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ), SDH ( social determinants of health ), SEMN ( southeast Minnesota ), SES ( socioeconomic status )\n\n【11】On March 6, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with individual states issuing stay-at-home orders soon thereafter. Two community-based population surveillance studies in Europe reported the prevalence of COVID-19 (1% in a random sample of 2283 residents in Iceland \\[April 1-4\\]\n\n【12】Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic population.\n\n【13】and 1.2% in 2343 residents of Vo in Italy \\[February 23-March 8\\]\n\n【14】10.1038/s41586-020-2956-7\\].\n\n【15】).\n\n【16】The nationwide issuance of the stay-at-home order significantly reduced the burden and transmission of COVID-19. For example, the orders were associated with a 30% to 49% reduction of cases and a 60% reduction of COVID-19–related deaths during the first 3 weeks of issuance of the orders,\n\n【17】and this is true for the state of Minnesota.\n\n【18】As the states lifted the stay-at-home orders, resurgence of COVID-19 was observed at a national level.\n\n【19】删除21:<u>In the state of Minnesota, the stay-at-home order was enforced from March 27, 2020, through May 18, 2020.</u>\n\n【20】To date, no community-based population surveillance studies have assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 after the stay-at-home orders were lifted in a well-defined population in a mixed rural-urban setting of the United States. In addition, few studies assessed the influence of adherence to the recommended public health measures and social determinants of health (SDH) as factors characterizing COVID-19 cases and healthy individuals in the community. For example, a meta-analysis, which compiled 44 studies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus primarily in health care settings, reported that adhering to the recommended public health measures including physical distancing, masks, and eye protection reduced the risk of transmission of COVID-19, SARS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.\n\n【21】However, none of these studies assessed such effects in the community. Also, although environmental conditions and SDH have been reported to be one of the major risk factors for the transmission of COVID-19 in the community,\n\n【22】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【23】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【26】little is known about the role of SDH in the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the community.\n\n【27】Therefore, we assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and characteristics of study subjects in a community-based sample of adults 50 years and older residing in southeast Minnesota (SEMN) via community-based population surveillance during a period when restrictions for the stay-at-home order were being lifted.\n\n【28】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【29】The ongoing parent study assessing a viral infection was designed to follow adults 50 years and older residing in SEMN between October 2019 and April 2021. According to US census data in 2010, the age, sex, and ethnic characteristics of Olmsted County residents (89% of the study subjects) were similar to those of the state of Minnesota and the Upper Midwest\n\n【30】Study Group on Heterogeneity of HIV Epidemics in African Cities. The epidemiology of gonorrhoea, chlamydial infection and syphilis in four African cities.\n\n【31】except for a large proportion of residents working in the health care industry. We enrolled patients paneled in the primary care practice of Mayo Clinic's campus in Rochester, Minnesota. For this study, we identified all individuals who resided in SEMN (largely from 4 counties including Olmsted, Dodge, Wabasha, and Goodhue) on April 1, 2019, by using electronic health records.\n\n【32】The first COVID-19 case in Olmsted County was reported on March 11, 2020. As of July 1, 2020 (at the end of our present study between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020), the total number of COVID-19 cases were 37,210 in the state of Minnesota, 1076 in Olmsted (a population of 158,293), 83 in Dodge (a population of 20,934), 31 in Wabasha (a population of 21,627), and 127 in Goodhue (a population of 46,340) counties. The virus circulation remained relatively constant over the study period in the counties. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.\n\n【33】The study was designed as a cross-sectional study nested in a parent prospective cohort study, which enrolled a population-based sample of adults 50 years and older residing in SEMN and represents a stratified random sample by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the parent study can be found in the Supplemental Material . Subjects who agreed to participate in the present study were screened for COVID-19 symptoms and then were instructed to self-collect swabs (regardless of COVID-19 symptoms) of both the anterior nares and oropharynx (throat) using packaged testing kits distributed to consented participants between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Specimens were returned to the performing laboratory by a prearranged courier service within 24 hours for testing for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The study aims were to assess the prevalence and characteristics of COVID-19 cases on the basis of symptom status via a questionnaire survey completed by the participants at the time of swab collection. The institutional process for handling positive cases of COVID-19 was to be activated for positive results.\n\n【34】### Assessment of Exposure to and Symptoms of COVID-19 by a Survey at the Time of Testing\n\n【35】We established detailed exposure and symptom screening algorithms on the basis of the institutionally recommended guidelines derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\n【36】### Instructions for Self-collecting Swabs of Anterior Nares and Oropharynx\n\n【37】We developed instructions and workflow for self-collecting swabs of anterior nares and oropharynx  as reported by others.\n\n【38】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【39】Comparison of unsupervised home self-collected midnasal swabs with clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【40】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【41】Assessment of sensitivity and specificity of patient-collected lower nasal specimens for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing .\n\n【42】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【43】Swabs collected by patients or health care workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing.\n\n【44】The concordance rates for positive PCR test results for both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus between swabs performed by research staff and self-swabs were 99% (95% CI, 94% to 100%) in our parent study (N=98).\n\n【45】### Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Testing\n\n【46】Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions for the real-time reverse transcription PCR–based cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) that has received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. This assay detects the SARS-CoV-2 _ORF1ab_ and _E_ gene sequences, and test results were reported as target detected, target not detected, presumptive positive (when only the _E_ gene sequence was detected), or inconclusive (when PCR inhibition was present).\n\n【47】### Other Pertinent Variables\n\n【48】We also collected both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs in the same fashion as described above during the flu season (from November 1, 2019, through April 30, 2020) when our parent study cohort developed acute respiratory illnesses .\n\n【49】### Data Analyses\n\n【50】We collated descriptive statistics summarizing characteristics of study subjects. Among those participating in this study, the proportion (prevalence) of subjects with confirmed COVID-19 by PCR and their characteristics were also evaluated.\n\n【51】Results\n-------\n\n【52】### Characteristics of Study Subjects\n\n【53】Characteristics of study subjects are summarized in Table 1 . Of the 2325 adults who participated in the parent study, 1508 participated in this present study and 3 subjects were excluded as 2 subjects did not have reverse transcription PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 subject had missing survey data. There were no marked differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between those who participated and those who did not (data not shown). The mean age of subjects was 68±9.6 years, and women were represented by 59%. Although minority subjects (32 \\[2%\\]) were underrepresented in our study, 313 (21%) were rural residents, 566 (43%) were those with less than 4-year college education, 536 (38%) were those with SES below the median of our study population, 514 (35%) were current or former smokers, and 906 (60%) were those who had high-risk comorbidities for influenza (also for COVID-19).\n\n【54】Table 1 Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Study Participants (N=1505)\n\n【55】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【56】BMI, body mass index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HOUSES, Housing-based Socioeconomic Index; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【57】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【58】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【59】Data are presented as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n| Characteristic | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR | 0 (0) |\n| Age at the time of testing (y) | 68 ± 9.6 |\n| Sex |  |\n| Female | 885 (58.8) |\n| Male | 620 (41.2) |\n| Race/ethnicity |  |\n| American Indian/Alaskan Native | 4 (0.3) |\n| Asian | 11 (0.7) |\n| Black | 6 (0.4) |\n| Hispanic or Latino | 11 (0.7) |\n| Non-Hispanic white | 1457 (96.8) |\n| Unknown | 16 (1.1) |\n| Rurality |  |\n| Living in rural area | 312 (20.7) |\n| Living in urban area | 1193 (79.2) |\n| Socioeconomic status (HOUSES index in quartile) |  |\n| 1 (lowest) | 174 (12.3) |\n| 2 | 362 (25.5) |\n| 3 | 402 (28.3) |\n| 4 (highest) | 482 (33.9) |\n| Missing | 85 (5.6) |\n| Education level |  |\n| High school or less | 139 (10.6) |\n| Some college | 427 (32.4) |\n| Four year college graduate | 406 (30.8) |\n| Graduate or professional school | 345 (26.2) |\n| Missing | 188 (12.5) |\n| Smoking status |  |\n| Never | 951 (64.9) |\n| Former | 477 (32.6) |\n| Current | 37 (2.5) |\n| Missing | 40 (2.7) |\n| Chronic illnesscChronic illnesses were defined using electronic health records within 1 y of enrollment in the parent study. |  |\n| Any conditions | 908 (60.3) |\n| Hypertension | 576 (38.3) |\n| Coronary heart disease | 23 (1.5) |\n| Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) 72 (4.8) |  |\n| Chronic kidney diseases | 119 (7.9) |\n| Chronic liver diseases | 32 (2.1) |\n| Immune suppressive conditions | 70 (4.7) |\n| Malignant tumor | 212 (14.1) |\n| Congestive heart failure | 44 (2.9) |\n| Asthma | 118 (7.8) |\n| Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | 70 (4.7) |\n| Any other heart or lung disease | 304 (20.2) |\n| Diabetes mellitus | 164 (10.9) |\n\n【61】a BMI, body mass index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HOUSES, Housing-based Socioeconomic Index; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【62】b Data are presented as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n【63】c Chronic illnesses were defined using electronic health records within 1 y of enrollment in the parent study.\n\n【64】### Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Study Subjects\n\n【65】Characteristics of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 cases at the time of testing for SARS-CoV-2 are summarized in Table 2 . Only 28 (2%) study subjects reported being exposed to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time of testing, and most exposures were outside the household (27 \\[96%\\]). One hundred sixty subjects (11%) reported to have at least 1 clinical symptom at the time of testing. One hundred thirty nine participants (9%) were health care workers and 12% had traveled outside Minnesota. Most study subjects (86%)(1,282 \\[86%\\]) resided in a single family home, whereas only 216 participants (14%) resided in multiunit dwellings, mobile home communities, or other group quarters.\n\n【66】Table 2 COVID-19–Related Exposures at the Time of Testing for COVID-19 in Study Participants\n\n【67】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【68】删除21:<u>COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.</u>\n\n【69】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【70】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【71】Data are presented as No. (percentage).\n\n| COVID-19–related exposure | Variable |\n| --- | --- |\n| Close contact (ever)cClose contact was defined as being within ~6 ft (2 m) of another person for a prolonged period of time, which could occur while caring for or living with someone else, visiting, socializing, working, or sharing a health care waiting area.with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases |  |\n| No | 1344 (89.4) |\n| Yes | 28 (1.9) |\n| Unknown | 132 (8.8) |\n| Missing | 1 (0.1) |\n| Relationship with COVID-19 cases among those who had contact with COVID-19 cases |  |\n| Patient in health care setting | 8 (28.6) |\n| Household | 1 (3.6) |\n| Coworker | 5 (17.9) |\n| Other | 14 (50.0) |\n| Self-reported any symptoms within 14 d at the time of screening |  |\n| No | 1297 (89.0) |\n| Yes | 160 (11.0) |\n| Missing | 48 (3.2) |\n| Health care provider (eg, physicians, nurses) |  |\n| No | 1361 (90.7) |\n| Yes | 139 (9.3) |\n| Missing | 5 (0.3) |\n| Been outside Minnesota in the past 14 d |  |\n| No | 1312 (87.6) |\n| Yes | 185 (12.4) |\n| Missing | 8 (0.5) |\n| Been outside the United States in the past 14 d |  |\n| No | 1504 (100) |\n| Yes | 0 (0) |\n| Missing | 1 (0.1) |\n| Primary residence |  |\n| Single family home | 1282 (85.6) |\n| Multiunit dwelling | 199 (13.3) |\n| Nursing home | 4 (0.3) |\n| Room in home (others home) | 0 (0) |\n| Other community dwelling | 13 (0.9) |\n| Missing | 7 (0.5) |\n\n【73】删除21:<u>a COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.</u>\n\n【74】b Data are presented as No. (percentage).\n\n【75】c _Close contact_ was defined as being within ~6 ft (2 m) of another person for a prolonged period of time, which could occur while caring for or living with someone else, visiting, socializing, working, or sharing a health care waiting area.\n\n【76】### Prevalence of COVID-19 and Characteristics Mitigating the Risk of Transmitting COVID-19\n\n【77】Of the 1505 subjects tested for COVID-19, _none_ came back positive during the study period (May through June 2020). For this unexpected study result, given the multiple individual risk factors (eg, prevalent comorbidities and older age) for COVID-19 in our study subjects, we focused our analyses on identifying factors potentially mitigating the risk of transmitting COVID-19, which may have led to a significant reduction in the burden of COVID-19 cases in our study subjects and community.

One hundred nine (7%) had infections by 1 or more seasonal coronaviruses—HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43—during the flu season (October through April), and 7% had influenza A or B. Influenza vaccination within 1 year before enrollment in the parent study and pneumococcal vaccination ever before enrollment in the parent study were 452 (30%) and 803 (53%), respectively.\n\n【98】Discussion\n----------\n\n【99】To our knowledge, this is the first community-based population surveillance study in a well-defined population after the stay-at-home order was lifted, which comprehensively characterized the study population using clinical, virological, and behavioral data in the United States. Our results indicated that although the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43) in our study cohort (7%) was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season, there were _no COVID-19 cases_ among the 1505 study participants during the study period (between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020). Despite the large proportion of study subjects affected by risk factors for COVID-19 (eg, high-risk comorbidities for influenza and older age), _almost all subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures and 86% of participants resided in a single family housing units instead of high-density housing units (eg, apartments). Although our study results were unexpected and did not have a comparative reference group, they nonetheless provide an important insight into the characteristics of a population protected from COVID-19, where such protection is potentially rooted in adherence to public health recommendations and thus would support the current public health recommendations to be more fully implemented at the community, state, and national levels.\n\n【100】Our study results are unexpected given the reported prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in various study settings including the community. For example, 2 community-based population surveillance studies, which are similar to our study, reported the prevalence of COVID-19 (13 \\[0.6%\\] in a random sample of 2283 residents in Iceland \\[April 1-4\\]\n\n【101】Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic population.\n\n【102】and 1.2% in a sample of 2343 residents of Vo (out of 3275) in Italy \\[February 23-March 8\\]\n\n【103】10.1038/s41586-020-2956-7\\].\n\n【104】) and asymptomatic COVID-19 (7 of 13 \\[54%\\] in the Iceland study and 30 of 73 \\[41%\\] in the Italian study at the time of testing). As our study results were based on self-swab at home, one might be concerned about systematic performance biases (from subject’s specimen collection) leading to potential false negativity. However, during our study, the concordance rates for both respiratory syncytial virus and influenza between self-swab and swab by research staff were 99%. In addition, although it is not part of the present report, our ongoing work assessing the prevalence of COVID-19 during the flu season using the same processes and methods as the present study indeed found a positive case, suggesting that our study findings are unlikely to be due to performance biases or errors leading to false negativity.\n\n【105】Although our study participants overrepresented the White race as a protective factor for COVID-19 raising a selection bias, it is unlikely to account for our study finding. For example, the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections in our study cohort  was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season.\n\n【106】The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System by US laboratories (117 laboratories reported 854,575 HCoV tests) from July 2014 through June 2017 (ie, pre–COVID-19 pandemic) reported that 2.2% were positive for HCoV-OC43, 1.0% for HCoV-NL63, 0.8% for HCoV-229E, and 0.6% for HCoV-HKU1.\n\n【107】Also, the prevalence of influenza in our study participants during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7% whereas that of an older cohort _during the pre-COVID-19 pandemic was 7%_ .\n\n【108】Our study subjects exhibited a high health care worker rate (9%), which may mean a potentially higher chance of contacting people including patients as essential workers, but also they might have had better personal protective equipment, of which the net effects are unknown but presumably higher for COVID-19.\n\n【109】Our study results provide guidance to communities in terms of how to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\n\n【110】First, as shown in Table 1 , our study cohort encompasses population features representing both reported protective (eg, predominant White race and higher proportion of women) and risk (eg, high frequency of high-risk comorbidities and older age) factors for COVID-19. Apart from these nonmodifiable risk and protective factors, our study results indicated that _almost all study subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures for COVID-19, as shown in Table 3 .

The community prevalence of COVID-19 in this setting is relatively low compared with the national level (68 per 1,000,000 vs 847 per 1,000,000 as of July 1, 2020), so the results may not be generalizable to other study settings.

Participants were instructed to self-collect both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, which were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction–based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay between May 8, 2020, and June, 30, 2020. We assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and characteristics of study subjects.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 1505 eligible subjects participated in the study whose mean age was 68 years, with 885 (59%) women, 32 (2%) racial/ethnic minorities, and 906 (60%) with high-risk conditions for influenza. The prevalence of other Coronaviridae (human coronavirus \\[HCoV\\]-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) during the 2019 to 2020 flu season was 109 (7%), and _none_ tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. _Almost all participants_ reported adhering to the RPHM (1,488 \\[99%\\] for social distancing, 1,438 \\[96%\\] for wearing mask in a public space, 1,476 \\[98%\\] for hand hygiene, and 1,441 (96%) for staying home mostly). Eighty-six percent of participants resided in a single-family home.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】We did not identify SARS-COV-2 infection in our study cohort. The combination of participants’ behavior in following the RPHM and their living environment may considerably mitigate the risk of COVID-19.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】COVID-19 ( coronavirus disease 2019 ), HCoV ( human coronavirus ), PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ), RPHM ( recommended public health measures ), SARS-CoV-2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ), SDH ( social determinants of health ), SEMN ( southeast Minnesota ), SES ( socioeconomic status )\n\n【11】On March 6, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with individual states issuing stay-at-home orders soon thereafter.

For example, the orders were associated with a 30% to 49% reduction of cases and a 60% reduction of COVID-19–related deaths during the first 3 weeks of issuance of the orders,\n\n【17】and this is true for the state of Minnesota.\n\n【18】As the states lifted the stay-at-home orders, resurgence of COVID-19 was observed at a national level.\n\n【19】删除21:<u>In the state of Minnesota, the stay-at-home order was enforced from March 27, 2020, through May 18, 2020.</u>\n\n【20】To date, no community-based population surveillance studies have assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 after the stay-at-home orders were lifted in a well-defined population in a mixed rural-urban setting of the United States. In addition, few studies assessed the influence of adherence to the recommended public health measures and social determinants of health (SDH) as factors characterizing COVID-19 cases and healthy individuals in the community. For example, a meta-analysis, which compiled 44 studies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus primarily in health care settings, reported that adhering to the recommended public health measures including physical distancing, masks, and eye protection reduced the risk of transmission of COVID-19, SARS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.\n\n【21】However, none of these studies assessed such effects in the community. Also, although environmental conditions and SDH have been reported to be one of the major risk factors for the transmission of COVID-19 in the community,\n\n【22】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【23】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【26】little is known about the role of SDH in the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the community.\n\n【27】Therefore, we assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and characteristics of study subjects in a community-based sample of adults 50 years and older residing in southeast Minnesota (SEMN) via community-based population surveillance during a period when restrictions for the stay-at-home order were being lifted.\n\n【28】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【29】The ongoing parent study assessing a viral infection was designed to follow adults 50 years and older residing in SEMN between October 2019 and April 2021. According to US census data in 2010, the age, sex, and ethnic characteristics of Olmsted County residents (89% of the study subjects) were similar to those of the state of Minnesota and the Upper Midwest\n\n【30】Study Group on Heterogeneity of HIV Epidemics in African Cities.

We enrolled patients paneled in the primary care practice of Mayo Clinic's campus in Rochester, Minnesota. For this study, we identified all individuals who resided in SEMN (largely from 4 counties including Olmsted, Dodge, Wabasha, and Goodhue) on April 1, 2019, by using electronic health records.\n\n【32】The first COVID-19 case in Olmsted County was reported on March 11, 2020. As of July 1, 2020 (at the end of our present study between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020), the total number of COVID-19 cases were 37,210 in the state of Minnesota, 1076 in Olmsted (a population of 158,293), 83 in Dodge (a population of 20,934), 31 in Wabasha (a population of 21,627), and 127 in Goodhue (a population of 46,340) counties. The virus circulation remained relatively constant over the study period in the counties. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.\n\n【33】The study was designed as a cross-sectional study nested in a parent prospective cohort study, which enrolled a population-based sample of adults 50 years and older residing in SEMN and represents a stratified random sample by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the parent study can be found in the Supplemental Material . Subjects who agreed to participate in the present study were screened for COVID-19 symptoms and then were instructed to self-collect swabs (regardless of COVID-19 symptoms) of both the anterior nares and oropharynx (throat) using packaged testing kits distributed to consented participants between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Specimens were returned to the performing laboratory by a prearranged courier service within 24 hours for testing for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The study aims were to assess the prevalence and characteristics of COVID-19 cases on the basis of symptom status via a questionnaire survey completed by the participants at the time of swab collection. The institutional process for handling positive cases of COVID-19 was to be activated for positive results.\n\n【34】### Assessment of Exposure to and Symptoms of COVID-19 by a Survey at the Time of Testing\n\n【35】We established detailed exposure and symptom screening algorithms on the basis of the institutionally recommended guidelines derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\n【36】### Instructions for Self-collecting Swabs of Anterior Nares and Oropharynx\n\n【37】We developed instructions and workflow for self-collecting swabs of anterior nares and oropharynx  as reported by others.\n\n【38】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【39】Comparison of unsupervised home self-collected midnasal swabs with clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【40】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【41】Assessment of sensitivity and specificity of patient-collected lower nasal specimens for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing .\n\n【42】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【43】Swabs collected by patients or health care workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing.\n\n【44】The concordance rates for positive PCR test results for both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus between swabs performed by research staff and self-swabs were 99% (95% CI, 94% to 100%) in our parent study (N=98).\n\n【45】### Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Testing\n\n【46】Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions for the real-time reverse transcription PCR–based cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) that has received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. This assay detects the SARS-CoV-2 _ORF1ab_ and _E_ gene sequences, and test results were reported as target detected, target not detected, presumptive positive (when only the _E_ gene sequence was detected), or inconclusive (when PCR inhibition was present).\n\n【47】### Other Pertinent Variables\n\n【48】We also collected both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs in the same fashion as described above during the flu season (from November 1, 2019, through April 30, 2020) when our parent study cohort developed acute respiratory illnesses .\n\n【49】### Data Analyses\n\n【50】We collated descriptive statistics summarizing characteristics of study subjects.

Of the 2325 adults who participated in the parent study, 1508 participated in this present study and 3 subjects were excluded as 2 subjects did not have reverse transcription PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 subject had missing survey data. There were no marked differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between those who participated and those who did not (data not shown). The mean age of subjects was 68±9.6 years, and women were represented by 59%. Although minority subjects (32 \\[2%\\]) were underrepresented in our study, 313 (21%) were rural residents, 566 (43%) were those with less than 4-year college education, 536 (38%) were those with SES below the median of our study population, 514 (35%) were current or former smokers, and 906 (60%) were those who had high-risk comorbidities for influenza (also for COVID-19).\n\n【54】Table 1 Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Study Participants (N=1505)\n\n【55】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【56】BMI, body mass index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HOUSES, Housing-based Socioeconomic Index; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【57】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【58】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【59】Data are presented as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n| Characteristic | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR | 0 (0) |\n| Age at the time of testing (y) | 68 ± 9.6 |\n| Sex |  |\n| Female | 885 (58.8) |\n| Male | 620 (41.2) |\n| Race/ethnicity |  |\n| American Indian/Alaskan Native | 4 (0.3) |\n| Asian | 11 (0.7) |\n| Black | 6 (0.4) |\n| Hispanic or Latino | 11 (0.7) |\n| Non-Hispanic white | 1457 (96.8) |\n| Unknown | 16 (1.1) |\n| Rurality |  |\n| Living in rural area | 312 (20.7) |\n| Living in urban area | 1193 (79.2) |\n| Socioeconomic status (HOUSES index in quartile) |  |\n| 1 (lowest) | 174 (12.3) |\n| 2 | 362 (25.5) |\n| 3 | 402 (28.3) |\n| 4 (highest) | 482 (33.9) |\n| Missing | 85 (5.6) |\n| Education level |  |\n| High school or less | 139 (10.6) |\n| Some college | 427 (32.4) |\n| Four year college graduate | 406 (30.8) |\n| Graduate or professional school | 345 (26.2) |\n| Missing | 188 (12.5) |\n| Smoking status |  |\n| Never | 951 (64.9) |\n| Former | 477 (32.6) |\n| Current | 37 (2.5) |\n| Missing | 40 (2.7) |\n| Chronic illnesscChronic illnesses were defined using electronic health records within 1 y of enrollment in the parent study. |  |\n| Any conditions | 908 (60.3) |\n| Hypertension | 576 (38.3) |\n| Coronary heart disease | 23 (1.5) |\n| Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) 72 (4.8) |  |\n| Chronic kidney diseases | 119 (7.9) |\n| Chronic liver diseases | 32 (2.1) |\n| Immune suppressive conditions | 70 (4.7) |\n| Malignant tumor | 212 (14.1) |\n| Congestive heart failure | 44 (2.9) |\n| Asthma | 118 (7.8) |\n| Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | 70 (4.7) |\n| Any other heart or lung disease | 304 (20.2) |\n| Diabetes mellitus | 164 (10.9) |\n\n【61】a BMI, body mass index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HOUSES, Housing-based Socioeconomic Index; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【62】b Data are presented as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n【63】c Chronic illnesses were defined using electronic health records within 1 y of enrollment in the parent study.\n\n【64】### Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Study Subjects\n\n【65】Characteristics of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 cases at the time of testing for SARS-CoV-2 are summarized in Table 2 .

Influenza vaccination within 1 year before enrollment in the parent study and pneumococcal vaccination ever before enrollment in the parent study were 452 (30%) and 803 (53%), respectively.\n\n【98】Discussion\n----------\n\n【99】To our knowledge, this is the first community-based population surveillance study in a well-defined population after the stay-at-home order was lifted, which comprehensively characterized the study population using clinical, virological, and behavioral data in the United States. Our results indicated that although the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43) in our study cohort (7%) was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season, there were _no COVID-19 cases_ among the 1505 study participants during the study period (between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020). Despite the large proportion of study subjects affected by risk factors for COVID-19 (eg, high-risk comorbidities for influenza and older age), _almost all subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures and 86% of participants resided in a single family housing units instead of high-density housing units (eg, apartments). Although our study results were unexpected and did not have a comparative reference group, they nonetheless provide an important insight into the characteristics of a population protected from COVID-19, where such protection is potentially rooted in adherence to public health recommendations and thus would support the current public health recommendations to be more fully implemented at the community, state, and national levels.\n\n【100】Our study results are unexpected given the reported prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in various study settings including the community. For example, 2 community-based population surveillance studies, which are similar to our study, reported the prevalence of COVID-19 (13 \\[0.6%\\] in a random sample of 2283 residents in Iceland \\[April 1-4\\]\n\n【101】Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic population.\n\n【102】and 1.2% in a sample of 2343 residents of Vo (out of 3275) in Italy \\[February 23-March 8\\]\n\n【103】10.1038/s41586-020-2956-7\\].\n\n【104】) and asymptomatic COVID-19 (7 of 13 \\[54%\\] in the Iceland study and 30 of 73 \\[41%\\] in the Italian study at the time of testing). As our study results were based on self-swab at home, one might be concerned about systematic performance biases (from subject’s specimen collection) leading to potential false negativity. However, during our study, the concordance rates for both respiratory syncytial virus and influenza between self-swab and swab by research staff were 99%. In addition, although it is not part of the present report, our ongoing work assessing the prevalence of COVID-19 during the flu season using the same processes and methods as the present study indeed found a positive case, suggesting that our study findings are unlikely to be due to performance biases or errors leading to false negativity.\n\n【105】Although our study participants overrepresented the White race as a protective factor for COVID-19 raising a selection bias, it is unlikely to account for our study finding. For example, the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections in our study cohort  was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season.\n\n【106】The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System by US laboratories (117 laboratories reported 854,575 HCoV tests) from July 2014 through June 2017 (ie, pre–COVID-19 pandemic) reported that 2.2% were positive for HCoV-OC43, 1.0% for HCoV-NL63, 0.8% for HCoV-229E, and 0.6% for HCoV-HKU1.\n\n【107】Also, the prevalence of influenza in our study participants during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7% whereas that of an older cohort _during the pre-COVID-19 pandemic was 7%_ .\n\n【108】Our study subjects exhibited a high health care worker rate (9%), which may mean a potentially higher chance of contacting people including patients as essential workers, but also they might have had better personal protective equipment, of which the net effects are unknown but presumably higher for COVID-19.\n\n【109】Our study results provide guidance to communities in terms of how to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\n\n【110】First, as shown in Table 1 , our study cohort encompasses population features representing both reported protective (eg, predominant White race and higher proportion of women) and risk (eg, high frequency of high-risk comorbidities and older age) factors for COVID-19. Apart from these nonmodifiable risk and protective factors, our study results indicated that _almost all study subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures for COVID-19, as shown in Table 3 . The literature suggested that only about 70% to 90% of people followed social distancing policy, depending on age.\n\n【111】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【112】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【113】What protective health measures are Americans taking in response to COVID-19?

Given the current unnecessary skepticism and controversies over current public health recommendations to preventing transmissibility of COVID-19, our study findings based on subjects who were protected from COVID-19 should provide guidance and reinforcement for following the recommended simple public health measures at the community, state, and national levels, as found in recent reports.\n\n【123】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【124】The effect of large-scale anti-contagion policies on the COVID-19 pandemic .\n\n【125】Second, as shown in Table 2 , 86% of our study subjects resided in single family housing units, which is higher than the national average single family homeownership rate (68% in 2020)\n\n【126】and could be another important factor mitigating the risk of COVID-19 as one of the important risk factors for COVID-19 is crowded residential units.\n\n【127】Associations between built environment, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women in New York City.\n\n【128】This finding highlights the importance of at least 1 social determinant of health, such as housing or even arranging a temporary place for isolation or quarantine of the affected family members for those living in crowded residential units (eg, apartments) beyond testing and tracing to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmissibility in the community.\n\n【129】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【130】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【131】Third, as shown in Table 4 , among our study subjects, 8% had seasonal coronavirus infections (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) during the past flu season (October 2019 through April 2020).

However, we believe that the present single group analysis still provides a valuable insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19 without including an arbitrary reference group. The community prevalence of COVID-19 in this setting is relatively low compared with the national level (68 per 1,000,000 vs 847 per 1,000,000 as of July 1, 2020), so the results may not be generalizable to other study settings. Desirability bias through phone interview might have played a role in the high percentage of adhering to public health measures, although it is unlikely.\n\n【143】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【144】Although the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections in our study cohort (7%) was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season, we did not observe subjects in this cohort testing positive for COVID-19. The combination of participants’ behavior in following the recommended public health measures and a social determinant of health, such as access to a single family housing, may significantly mitigate the risk of COVID-19.

Participants were instructed to self-collect both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs, which were tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction–based severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) assay between May 8, 2020, and June, 30, 2020. We assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and characteristics of study subjects.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 1505 eligible subjects participated in the study whose mean age was 68 years, with 885 (59%) women, 32 (2%) racial/ethnic minorities, and 906 (60%) with high-risk conditions for influenza. The prevalence of other Coronaviridae (human coronavirus \\[HCoV\\]-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) during the 2019 to 2020 flu season was 109 (7%), and _none_ tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. _Almost all participants_ reported adhering to the RPHM (1,488 \\[99%\\] for social distancing, 1,438 \\[96%\\] for wearing mask in a public space, 1,476 \\[98%\\] for hand hygiene, and 1,441 (96%) for staying home mostly). Eighty-six percent of participants resided in a single-family home.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】We did not identify SARS-COV-2 infection in our study cohort. The combination of participants’ behavior in following the RPHM and their living environment may considerably mitigate the risk of COVID-19.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】COVID-19 ( coronavirus disease 2019 ), HCoV ( human coronavirus ), PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ), RPHM ( recommended public health measures ), SARS-CoV-2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ), SDH ( social determinants of health ), SEMN ( southeast Minnesota ), SES ( socioeconomic status )\n\n【11】On March 6, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with individual states issuing stay-at-home orders soon thereafter.

For example, the orders were associated with a 30% to 49% reduction of cases and a 60% reduction of COVID-19–related deaths during the first 3 weeks of issuance of the orders,\n\n【17】and this is true for the state of Minnesota.\n\n【18】As the states lifted the stay-at-home orders, resurgence of COVID-19 was observed at a national level.\n\n【19】删除21:<u>In the state of Minnesota, the stay-at-home order was enforced from March 27, 2020, through May 18, 2020.</u>\n\n【20】To date, no community-based population surveillance studies have assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 after the stay-at-home orders were lifted in a well-defined population in a mixed rural-urban setting of the United States. In addition, few studies assessed the influence of adherence to the recommended public health measures and social determinants of health (SDH) as factors characterizing COVID-19 cases and healthy individuals in the community. For example, a meta-analysis, which compiled 44 studies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus primarily in health care settings, reported that adhering to the recommended public health measures including physical distancing, masks, and eye protection reduced the risk of transmission of COVID-19, SARS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.\n\n【21】However, none of these studies assessed such effects in the community. Also, although environmental conditions and SDH have been reported to be one of the major risk factors for the transmission of COVID-19 in the community,\n\n【22】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【23】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【26】little is known about the role of SDH in the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the community.\n\n【27】Therefore, we assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and characteristics of study subjects in a community-based sample of adults 50 years and older residing in southeast Minnesota (SEMN) via community-based population surveillance during a period when restrictions for the stay-at-home order were being lifted.\n\n【28】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【29】The ongoing parent study assessing a viral infection was designed to follow adults 50 years and older residing in SEMN between October 2019 and April 2021. According to US census data in 2010, the age, sex, and ethnic characteristics of Olmsted County residents (89% of the study subjects) were similar to those of the state of Minnesota and the Upper Midwest\n\n【30】Study Group on Heterogeneity of HIV Epidemics in African Cities.

For this study, we identified all individuals who resided in SEMN (largely from 4 counties including Olmsted, Dodge, Wabasha, and Goodhue) on April 1, 2019, by using electronic health records.\n\n【32】The first COVID-19 case in Olmsted County was reported on March 11, 2020. As of July 1, 2020 (at the end of our present study between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020), the total number of COVID-19 cases were 37,210 in the state of Minnesota, 1076 in Olmsted (a population of 158,293), 83 in Dodge (a population of 20,934), 31 in Wabasha (a population of 21,627), and 127 in Goodhue (a population of 46,340) counties. The virus circulation remained relatively constant over the study period in the counties. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.\n\n【33】The study was designed as a cross-sectional study nested in a parent prospective cohort study, which enrolled a population-based sample of adults 50 years and older residing in SEMN and represents a stratified random sample by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the parent study can be found in the Supplemental Material . Subjects who agreed to participate in the present study were screened for COVID-19 symptoms and then were instructed to self-collect swabs (regardless of COVID-19 symptoms) of both the anterior nares and oropharynx (throat) using packaged testing kits distributed to consented participants between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Specimens were returned to the performing laboratory by a prearranged courier service within 24 hours for testing for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The study aims were to assess the prevalence and characteristics of COVID-19 cases on the basis of symptom status via a questionnaire survey completed by the participants at the time of swab collection. The institutional process for handling positive cases of COVID-19 was to be activated for positive results.\n\n【34】### Assessment of Exposure to and Symptoms of COVID-19 by a Survey at the Time of Testing\n\n【35】We established detailed exposure and symptom screening algorithms on the basis of the institutionally recommended guidelines derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\n【36】### Instructions for Self-collecting Swabs of Anterior Nares and Oropharynx\n\n【37】We developed instructions and workflow for self-collecting swabs of anterior nares and oropharynx  as reported by others.\n\n【38】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【39】Comparison of unsupervised home self-collected midnasal swabs with clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【40】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【41】Assessment of sensitivity and specificity of patient-collected lower nasal specimens for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing .\n\n【42】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【43】Swabs collected by patients or health care workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing.\n\n【44】The concordance rates for positive PCR test results for both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus between swabs performed by research staff and self-swabs were 99% (95% CI, 94% to 100%) in our parent study (N=98).\n\n【45】### Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Testing\n\n【46】Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions for the real-time reverse transcription PCR–based cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) that has received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. This assay detects the SARS-CoV-2 _ORF1ab_ and _E_ gene sequences, and test results were reported as target detected, target not detected, presumptive positive (when only the _E_ gene sequence was detected), or inconclusive (when PCR inhibition was present).\n\n【47】### Other Pertinent Variables\n\n【48】We also collected both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs in the same fashion as described above during the flu season (from November 1, 2019, through April 30, 2020) when our parent study cohort developed acute respiratory illnesses .\n\n【49】### Data Analyses\n\n【50】We collated descriptive statistics summarizing characteristics of study subjects.

Of the 2325 adults who participated in the parent study, 1508 participated in this present study and 3 subjects were excluded as 2 subjects did not have reverse transcription PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 subject had missing survey data. There were no marked differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between those who participated and those who did not (data not shown). The mean age of subjects was 68±9.6 years, and women were represented by 59%. Although minority subjects (32 \\[2%\\]) were underrepresented in our study, 313 (21%) were rural residents, 566 (43%) were those with less than 4-year college education, 536 (38%) were those with SES below the median of our study population, 514 (35%) were current or former smokers, and 906 (60%) were those who had high-risk comorbidities for influenza (also for COVID-19).\n\n【54】Table 1 Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Study Participants (N=1505)\n\n【55】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【56】BMI, body mass index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HOUSES, Housing-based Socioeconomic Index; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【57】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【58】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【59】Data are presented as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n| Characteristic | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR | 0 (0) |\n| Age at the time of testing (y) | 68 ± 9.6 |\n| Sex |  |\n| Female | 885 (58.8) |\n| Male | 620 (41.2) |\n| Race/ethnicity |  |\n| American Indian/Alaskan Native | 4 (0.3) |\n| Asian | 11 (0.7) |\n| Black | 6 (0.4) |\n| Hispanic or Latino | 11 (0.7) |\n| Non-Hispanic white | 1457 (96.8) |\n| Unknown | 16 (1.1) |\n| Rurality |  |\n| Living in rural area | 312 (20.7) |\n| Living in urban area | 1193 (79.2) |\n| Socioeconomic status (HOUSES index in quartile) |  |\n| 1 (lowest) | 174 (12.3) |\n| 2 | 362 (25.5) |\n| 3 | 402 (28.3) |\n| 4 (highest) | 482 (33.9) |\n| Missing | 85 (5.6) |\n| Education level |  |\n| High school or less | 139 (10.6) |\n| Some college | 427 (32.4) |\n| Four year college graduate | 406 (30.8) |\n| Graduate or professional school | 345 (26.2) |\n| Missing | 188 (12.5) |\n| Smoking status |  |\n| Never | 951 (64.9) |\n| Former | 477 (32.6) |\n| Current | 37 (2.5) |\n| Missing | 40 (2.7) |\n| Chronic illnesscChronic illnesses were defined using electronic health records within 1 y of enrollment in the parent study. |  |\n| Any conditions | 908 (60.3) |\n| Hypertension | 576 (38.3) |\n| Coronary heart disease | 23 (1.5) |\n| Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) 72 (4.8) |  |\n| Chronic kidney diseases | 119 (7.9) |\n| Chronic liver diseases | 32 (2.1) |\n| Immune suppressive conditions | 70 (4.7) |\n| Malignant tumor | 212 (14.1) |\n| Congestive heart failure | 44 (2.9) |\n| Asthma | 118 (7.8) |\n| Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | 70 (4.7) |\n| Any other heart or lung disease | 304 (20.2) |\n| Diabetes mellitus | 164 (10.9) |\n\n【61】a BMI, body mass index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HOUSES, Housing-based Socioeconomic Index; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【62】b Data are presented as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n【63】c Chronic illnesses were defined using electronic health records within 1 y of enrollment in the parent study.\n\n【64】### Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Study Subjects\n\n【65】Characteristics of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 cases at the time of testing for SARS-CoV-2 are summarized in Table 2 .

For this unexpected study result, given the multiple individual risk factors (eg, prevalent comorbidities and older age) for COVID-19 in our study subjects, we focused our analyses on identifying factors potentially mitigating the risk of transmitting COVID-19, which may have led to a significant reduction in the burden of COVID-19 cases in our study subjects and community.

One hundred nine (7%) had infections by 1 or more seasonal coronaviruses—HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43—during the flu season (October through April), and 7% had influenza A or B. Influenza vaccination within 1 year before enrollment in the parent study and pneumococcal vaccination ever before enrollment in the parent study were 452 (30%) and 803 (53%), respectively.\n\n【98】Discussion\n----------\n\n【99】To our knowledge, this is the first community-based population surveillance study in a well-defined population after the stay-at-home order was lifted, which comprehensively characterized the study population using clinical, virological, and behavioral data in the United States. Our results indicated that although the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43) in our study cohort (7%) was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season, there were _no COVID-19 cases_ among the 1505 study participants during the study period (between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020). Despite the large proportion of study subjects affected by risk factors for COVID-19 (eg, high-risk comorbidities for influenza and older age), _almost all subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures and 86% of participants resided in a single family housing units instead of high-density housing units (eg, apartments). Although our study results were unexpected and did not have a comparative reference group, they nonetheless provide an important insight into the characteristics of a population protected from COVID-19, where such protection is potentially rooted in adherence to public health recommendations and thus would support the current public health recommendations to be more fully implemented at the community, state, and national levels.\n\n【100】Our study results are unexpected given the reported prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in various study settings including the community. For example, 2 community-based population surveillance studies, which are similar to our study, reported the prevalence of COVID-19 (13 \\[0.6%\\] in a random sample of 2283 residents in Iceland \\[April 1-4\\]\n\n【101】Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic population.\n\n【102】and 1.2% in a sample of 2343 residents of Vo (out of 3275) in Italy \\[February 23-March 8\\]\n\n【103】10.1038/s41586-020-2956-7\\].\n\n【104】) and asymptomatic COVID-19 (7 of 13 \\[54%\\] in the Iceland study and 30 of 73 \\[41%\\] in the Italian study at the time of testing). As our study results were based on self-swab at home, one might be concerned about systematic performance biases (from subject’s specimen collection) leading to potential false negativity. However, during our study, the concordance rates for both respiratory syncytial virus and influenza between self-swab and swab by research staff were 99%. In addition, although it is not part of the present report, our ongoing work assessing the prevalence of COVID-19 during the flu season using the same processes and methods as the present study indeed found a positive case, suggesting that our study findings are unlikely to be due to performance biases or errors leading to false negativity.\n\n【105】Although our study participants overrepresented the White race as a protective factor for COVID-19 raising a selection bias, it is unlikely to account for our study finding. For example, the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections in our study cohort  was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season.\n\n【106】The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System by US laboratories (117 laboratories reported 854,575 HCoV tests) from July 2014 through June 2017 (ie, pre–COVID-19 pandemic) reported that 2.2% were positive for HCoV-OC43, 1.0% for HCoV-NL63, 0.8% for HCoV-229E, and 0.6% for HCoV-HKU1.\n\n【107】Also, the prevalence of influenza in our study participants during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7% whereas that of an older cohort _during the pre-COVID-19 pandemic was 7%_ .\n\n【108】Our study subjects exhibited a high health care worker rate (9%), which may mean a potentially higher chance of contacting people including patients as essential workers, but also they might have had better personal protective equipment, of which the net effects are unknown but presumably higher for COVID-19.\n\n【109】Our study results provide guidance to communities in terms of how to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\n\n【110】First, as shown in Table 1 , our study cohort encompasses population features representing both reported protective (eg, predominant White race and higher proportion of women) and risk (eg, high frequency of high-risk comorbidities and older age) factors for COVID-19. Apart from these nonmodifiable risk and protective factors, our study results indicated that _almost all study subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures for COVID-19, as shown in Table 3 . The literature suggested that only about 70% to 90% of people followed social distancing policy, depending on age.\n\n【111】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【112】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【113】What protective health measures are Americans taking in response to COVID-19?

Given the current unnecessary skepticism and controversies over current public health recommendations to preventing transmissibility of COVID-19, our study findings based on subjects who were protected from COVID-19 should provide guidance and reinforcement for following the recommended simple public health measures at the community, state, and national levels, as found in recent reports.\n\n【123】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【124】The effect of large-scale anti-contagion policies on the COVID-19 pandemic .\n\n【125】Second, as shown in Table 2 , 86% of our study subjects resided in single family housing units, which is higher than the national average single family homeownership rate (68% in 2020)\n\n【126】and could be another important factor mitigating the risk of COVID-19 as one of the important risk factors for COVID-19 is crowded residential units.\n\n【127】Associations between built environment, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women in New York City.\n\n【128】This finding highlights the importance of at least 1 social determinant of health, such as housing or even arranging a temporary place for isolation or quarantine of the affected family members for those living in crowded residential units (eg, apartments) beyond testing and tracing to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmissibility in the community.\n\n【129】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【130】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【131】Third, as shown in Table 4 , among our study subjects, 8% had seasonal coronavirus infections (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) during the past flu season (October 2019 through April 2020).

However, we believe that the present single group analysis still provides a valuable insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19 without including an arbitrary reference group. The community prevalence of COVID-19 in this setting is relatively low compared with the national level (68 per 1,000,000 vs 847 per 1,000,000 as of July 1, 2020), so the results may not be generalizable to other study settings. Desirability bias through phone interview might have played a role in the high percentage of adhering to public health measures, although it is unlikely.\n\n【143】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【144】Although the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections in our study cohort (7%) was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season, we did not observe subjects in this cohort testing positive for COVID-19. The combination of participants’ behavior in following the recommended public health measures and a social determinant of health, such as access to a single family housing, may significantly mitigate the risk of COVID-19. The biological effect of the preceding infections with non–SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviridae and its associated preexisting immune reactivity on the risk of COVID-19 remains to be determined.", "index": 3372, "show": true, "start": 3346, "end": 3460, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【102】and 1.2% in a sample of 2343 residents of Vo (out of 3275) in Italy [February 23-March 8]\n\n【103】10.1038/s41586-020-2956-7].", "content": "【0】Adherence to Public Health Measures Mitigates the Risk of COVID-19 Infection in Older Adults: A Community-Based Study\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Objective\n\n【2】To assess the prevalence and characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases during the reopening period in older adults, given that little is known about the prevalence of COVID-19 after the stay-at-home order was lifted in the United States, nor the actual effects of adherence to recommended public health measures (RPHM) on the risk of COVID-19.\n\n【3】### Patients and Methods\n\n【4】This was a cross-sectional study nested in a parent prospective cohort study, which followed a population-based sample of 2325 adults 50 years and older residing in southeast Minnesota to assess the incidence of viral infections.

In addition, few studies assessed the influence of adherence to the recommended public health measures and social determinants of health (SDH) as factors characterizing COVID-19 cases and healthy individuals in the community. For example, a meta-analysis, which compiled 44 studies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus primarily in health care settings, reported that adhering to the recommended public health measures including physical distancing, masks, and eye protection reduced the risk of transmission of COVID-19, SARS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.\n\n【21】However, none of these studies assessed such effects in the community.

For this study, we identified all individuals who resided in SEMN (largely from 4 counties including Olmsted, Dodge, Wabasha, and Goodhue) on April 1, 2019, by using electronic health records.\n\n【32】The first COVID-19 case in Olmsted County was reported on March 11, 2020. As of July 1, 2020 (at the end of our present study between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020), the total number of COVID-19 cases were 37,210 in the state of Minnesota, 1076 in Olmsted (a population of 158,293), 83 in Dodge (a population of 20,934), 31 in Wabasha (a population of 21,627), and 127 in Goodhue (a population of 46,340) counties. The virus circulation remained relatively constant over the study period in the counties. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.\n\n【33】The study was designed as a cross-sectional study nested in a parent prospective cohort study, which enrolled a population-based sample of adults 50 years and older residing in SEMN and represents a stratified random sample by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the parent study can be found in the Supplemental Material . Subjects who agreed to participate in the present study were screened for COVID-19 symptoms and then were instructed to self-collect swabs (regardless of COVID-19 symptoms) of both the anterior nares and oropharynx (throat) using packaged testing kits distributed to consented participants between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Specimens were returned to the performing laboratory by a prearranged courier service within 24 hours for testing for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The study aims were to assess the prevalence and characteristics of COVID-19 cases on the basis of symptom status via a questionnaire survey completed by the participants at the time of swab collection. The institutional process for handling positive cases of COVID-19 was to be activated for positive results.\n\n【34】### Assessment of Exposure to and Symptoms of COVID-19 by a Survey at the Time of Testing\n\n【35】We established detailed exposure and symptom screening algorithms on the basis of the institutionally recommended guidelines derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\n【36】### Instructions for Self-collecting Swabs of Anterior Nares and Oropharynx\n\n【37】We developed instructions and workflow for self-collecting swabs of anterior nares and oropharynx  as reported by others.\n\n【38】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【39】Comparison of unsupervised home self-collected midnasal swabs with clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【40】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【41】Assessment of sensitivity and specificity of patient-collected lower nasal specimens for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing .\n\n【42】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【43】Swabs collected by patients or health care workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing.\n\n【44】The concordance rates for positive PCR test results for both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus between swabs performed by research staff and self-swabs were 99% (95% CI, 94% to 100%) in our parent study (N=98).\n\n【45】### Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Testing\n\n【46】Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions for the real-time reverse transcription PCR–based cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) that has received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration.

One hundred nine (7%) had infections by 1 or more seasonal coronaviruses—HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43—during the flu season (October through April), and 7% had influenza A or B. Influenza vaccination within 1 year before enrollment in the parent study and pneumococcal vaccination ever before enrollment in the parent study were 452 (30%) and 803 (53%), respectively.\n\n【98】Discussion\n----------\n\n【99】To our knowledge, this is the first community-based population surveillance study in a well-defined population after the stay-at-home order was lifted, which comprehensively characterized the study population using clinical, virological, and behavioral data in the United States. Our results indicated that although the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43) in our study cohort (7%) was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season, there were _no COVID-19 cases_ among the 1505 study participants during the study period (between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020). Despite the large proportion of study subjects affected by risk factors for COVID-19 (eg, high-risk comorbidities for influenza and older age), _almost all subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures and 86% of participants resided in a single family housing units instead of high-density housing units (eg, apartments). Although our study results were unexpected and did not have a comparative reference group, they nonetheless provide an important insight into the characteristics of a population protected from COVID-19, where such protection is potentially rooted in adherence to public health recommendations and thus would support the current public health recommendations to be more fully implemented at the community, state, and national levels.\n\n【100】Our study results are unexpected given the reported prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in various study settings including the community. For example, 2 community-based population surveillance studies, which are similar to our study, reported the prevalence of COVID-19 (13 \\[0.6%\\] in a random sample of 2283 residents in Iceland \\[April 1-4\\]\n\n【101】Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic population.\n\n【102】and 1.2% in a sample of 2343 residents of Vo (out of 3275) in Italy \\[February 23-March 8\\]\n\n【103】10.1038/s41586-020-2956-7\\].\n\n【104】) and asymptomatic COVID-19 (7 of 13 \\[54%\\] in the Iceland study and 30 of 73 \\[41%\\] in the Italian study at the time of testing). As our study results were based on self-swab at home, one might be concerned about systematic performance biases (from subject’s specimen collection) leading to potential false negativity. However, during our study, the concordance rates for both respiratory syncytial virus and influenza between self-swab and swab by research staff were 99%. In addition, although it is not part of the present report, our ongoing work assessing the prevalence of COVID-19 during the flu season using the same processes and methods as the present study indeed found a positive case, suggesting that our study findings are unlikely to be due to performance biases or errors leading to false negativity.\n\n【105】Although our study participants overrepresented the White race as a protective factor for COVID-19 raising a selection bias, it is unlikely to account for our study finding. For example, the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections in our study cohort  was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season.\n\n【106】The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System by US laboratories (117 laboratories reported 854,575 HCoV tests) from July 2014 through June 2017 (ie, pre–COVID-19 pandemic) reported that 2.2% were positive for HCoV-OC43, 1.0% for HCoV-NL63, 0.8% for HCoV-229E, and 0.6% for HCoV-HKU1.\n\n【107】Also, the prevalence of influenza in our study participants during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7% whereas that of an older cohort _during the pre-COVID-19 pandemic was 7%_ .\n\n【108】Our study subjects exhibited a high health care worker rate (9%), which may mean a potentially higher chance of contacting people including patients as essential workers, but also they might have had better personal protective equipment, of which the net effects are unknown but presumably higher for COVID-19.\n\n【109】Our study results provide guidance to communities in terms of how to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\n\n【110】First, as shown in Table 1 , our study cohort encompasses population features representing both reported protective (eg, predominant White race and higher proportion of women) and risk (eg, high frequency of high-risk comorbidities and older age) factors for COVID-19. Apart from these nonmodifiable risk and protective factors, our study results indicated that _almost all study subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures for COVID-19, as shown in Table 3 . The literature suggested that only about 70% to 90% of people followed social distancing policy, depending on age.\n\n【111】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【112】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【113】What protective health measures are Americans taking in response to COVID-19?

Given the current unnecessary skepticism and controversies over current public health recommendations to preventing transmissibility of COVID-19, our study findings based on subjects who were protected from COVID-19 should provide guidance and reinforcement for following the recommended simple public health measures at the community, state, and national levels, as found in recent reports.\n\n【123】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【124】The effect of large-scale anti-contagion policies on the COVID-19 pandemic .\n\n【125】Second, as shown in Table 2 , 86% of our study subjects resided in single family housing units, which is higher than the national average single family homeownership rate (68% in 2020)\n\n【126】and could be another important factor mitigating the risk of COVID-19 as one of the important risk factors for COVID-19 is crowded residential units.\n\n【127】Associations between built environment, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women in New York City.\n\n【128】This finding highlights the importance of at least 1 social determinant of health, such as housing or even arranging a temporary place for isolation or quarantine of the affected family members for those living in crowded residential units (eg, apartments) beyond testing and tracing to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmissibility in the community.\n\n【129】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【130】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【131】Third, as shown in Table 4 , among our study subjects, 8% had seasonal coronavirus infections (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) during the past flu season (October 2019 through April 2020).

However, we believe that the present single group analysis still provides a valuable insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19 without including an arbitrary reference group. The community prevalence of COVID-19 in this setting is relatively low compared with the national level (68 per 1,000,000 vs 847 per 1,000,000 as of July 1, 2020), so the results may not be generalizable to other study settings. Desirability bias through phone interview might have played a role in the high percentage of adhering to public health measures, although it is unlikely.\n\n【143】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【144】Although the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections in our study cohort (7%) was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season, we did not observe subjects in this cohort testing positive for COVID-19. The combination of participants’ behavior in following the recommended public health measures and a social determinant of health, such as access to a single family housing, may significantly mitigate the risk of COVID-19. The biological effect of the preceding infections with non–SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviridae and its associated preexisting immune reactivity on the risk of COVID-19 remains to be determined.", "index": -1, "show": true, "start": -1, "end": 127, "province": ["语义有效性", "语义不完整"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【103】10.1038/s41586-020-2956-7]."}, {"text": "【101】Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic population.\n\n【102】and 1.2% in a sample of 2343 residents of Vo (out of 3275) in Italy [February 23-March 8]\n\n【103】10.1038/s41586-020-2956-7].\n\n【104】) an", "content": "【0】Adherence to Public Health Measures Mitigates the Risk of COVID-19 Infection in Older Adults: A Community-Based Study\nAbstract\n--------\n\n【1】### Objective\n\n【2】To assess the prevalence and characteristics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases during the reopening period in older adults, given that little is known about the prevalence of COVID-19 after the stay-at-home order was lifted in the United States, nor the actual effects of adherence to recommended public health measures (RPHM) on the risk of COVID-19.\n\n【3】### Patients and Methods\n\n【4】This was a cross-sectional study nested in a parent prospective cohort study, which followed a population-based sample of 2325 adults 50 years and older residing in southeast Minnesota to assess the incidence of viral infections.

In addition, few studies assessed the influence of adherence to the recommended public health measures and social determinants of health (SDH) as factors characterizing COVID-19 cases and healthy individuals in the community. For example, a meta-analysis, which compiled 44 studies for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), severe acute respiratory syndrome–associated coronavirus, or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus primarily in health care settings, reported that adhering to the recommended public health measures including physical distancing, masks, and eye protection reduced the risk of transmission of COVID-19, SARS, or Middle East respiratory syndrome.\n\n【21】However, none of these studies assessed such effects in the community. Also, although environmental conditions and SDH have been reported to be one of the major risk factors for the transmission of COVID-19 in the community,\n\n【22】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【23】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【26】little is known about the role of SDH in the risk of COVID-19 transmission in the community.\n\n【27】Therefore, we assessed the prevalence of COVID-19 cases and characteristics of study subjects in a community-based sample of adults 50 years and older residing in southeast Minnesota (SEMN) via community-based population surveillance during a period when restrictions for the stay-at-home order were being lifted.\n\n【28】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【29】The ongoing parent study assessing a viral infection was designed to follow adults 50 years and older residing in SEMN between October 2019 and April 2021.

As of July 1, 2020 (at the end of our present study between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020), the total number of COVID-19 cases were 37,210 in the state of Minnesota, 1076 in Olmsted (a population of 158,293), 83 in Dodge (a population of 20,934), 31 in Wabasha (a population of 21,627), and 127 in Goodhue (a population of 46,340) counties. The virus circulation remained relatively constant over the study period in the counties. The study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.\n\n【33】The study was designed as a cross-sectional study nested in a parent prospective cohort study, which enrolled a population-based sample of adults 50 years and older residing in SEMN and represents a stratified random sample by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Inclusion/exclusion criteria for the parent study can be found in the Supplemental Material . Subjects who agreed to participate in the present study were screened for COVID-19 symptoms and then were instructed to self-collect swabs (regardless of COVID-19 symptoms) of both the anterior nares and oropharynx (throat) using packaged testing kits distributed to consented participants between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020. Specimens were returned to the performing laboratory by a prearranged courier service within 24 hours for testing for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The study aims were to assess the prevalence and characteristics of COVID-19 cases on the basis of symptom status via a questionnaire survey completed by the participants at the time of swab collection. The institutional process for handling positive cases of COVID-19 was to be activated for positive results.\n\n【34】### Assessment of Exposure to and Symptoms of COVID-19 by a Survey at the Time of Testing\n\n【35】We established detailed exposure and symptom screening algorithms on the basis of the institutionally recommended guidelines derived from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\n【36】### Instructions for Self-collecting Swabs of Anterior Nares and Oropharynx\n\n【37】We developed instructions and workflow for self-collecting swabs of anterior nares and oropharynx  as reported by others.\n\n【38】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【39】Comparison of unsupervised home self-collected midnasal swabs with clinician-collected nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【40】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【41】Assessment of sensitivity and specificity of patient-collected lower nasal specimens for sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 testing .\n\n【42】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【43】Swabs collected by patients or health care workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing.\n\n【44】The concordance rates for positive PCR test results for both influenza and respiratory syncytial virus between swabs performed by research staff and self-swabs were 99% (95% CI, 94% to 100%) in our parent study (N=98).\n\n【45】### Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Testing\n\n【46】Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions for the real-time reverse transcription PCR–based cobas SARS-CoV-2 assay (Roche Molecular Systems, Inc.) that has received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. This assay detects the SARS-CoV-2 _ORF1ab_ and _E_ gene sequences, and test results were reported as target detected, target not detected, presumptive positive (when only the _E_ gene sequence was detected), or inconclusive (when PCR inhibition was present).\n\n【47】### Other Pertinent Variables\n\n【48】We also collected both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs in the same fashion as described above during the flu season (from November 1, 2019, through April 30, 2020) when our parent study cohort developed acute respiratory illnesses .\n\n【49】### Data Analyses\n\n【50】We collated descriptive statistics summarizing characteristics of study subjects. Among those participating in this study, the proportion (prevalence) of subjects with confirmed COVID-19 by PCR and their characteristics were also evaluated.\n\n【51】Results\n-------\n\n【52】### Characteristics of Study Subjects\n\n【53】Characteristics of study subjects are summarized in Table 1 . Of the 2325 adults who participated in the parent study, 1508 participated in this present study and 3 subjects were excluded as 2 subjects did not have reverse transcription PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 and 1 subject had missing survey data. There were no marked differences in demographic and clinical characteristics between those who participated and those who did not (data not shown). The mean age of subjects was 68±9.6 years, and women were represented by 59%. Although minority subjects (32 \\[2%\\]) were underrepresented in our study, 313 (21%) were rural residents, 566 (43%) were those with less than 4-year college education, 536 (38%) were those with SES below the median of our study population, 514 (35%) were current or former smokers, and 906 (60%) were those who had high-risk comorbidities for influenza (also for COVID-19).\n\n【54】Table 1 Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Study Participants (N=1505)\n\n【55】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【56】BMI, body mass index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HOUSES, Housing-based Socioeconomic Index; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【57】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【58】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【59】Data are presented as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n| Characteristic | Value |\n| --- | --- |\n| COVID-19 positive by RT-PCR | 0 (0) |\n| Age at the time of testing (y) | 68 ± 9.6 |\n| Sex |  |\n| Female | 885 (58.8) |\n| Male | 620 (41.2) |\n| Race/ethnicity |  |\n| American Indian/Alaskan Native | 4 (0.3) |\n| Asian | 11 (0.7) |\n| Black | 6 (0.4) |\n| Hispanic or Latino | 11 (0.7) |\n| Non-Hispanic white | 1457 (96.8) |\n| Unknown | 16 (1.1) |\n| Rurality |  |\n| Living in rural area | 312 (20.7) |\n| Living in urban area | 1193 (79.2) |\n| Socioeconomic status (HOUSES index in quartile) |  |\n| 1 (lowest) | 174 (12.3) |\n| 2 | 362 (25.5) |\n| 3 | 402 (28.3) |\n| 4 (highest) | 482 (33.9) |\n| Missing | 85 (5.6) |\n| Education level |  |\n| High school or less | 139 (10.6) |\n| Some college | 427 (32.4) |\n| Four year college graduate | 406 (30.8) |\n| Graduate or professional school | 345 (26.2) |\n| Missing | 188 (12.5) |\n| Smoking status |  |\n| Never | 951 (64.9) |\n| Former | 477 (32.6) |\n| Current | 37 (2.5) |\n| Missing | 40 (2.7) |\n| Chronic illnesscChronic illnesses were defined using electronic health records within 1 y of enrollment in the parent study. |  |\n| Any conditions | 908 (60.3) |\n| Hypertension | 576 (38.3) |\n| Coronary heart disease | 23 (1.5) |\n| Obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m 2 ) 72 (4.8) |  |\n| Chronic kidney diseases | 119 (7.9) |\n| Chronic liver diseases | 32 (2.1) |\n| Immune suppressive conditions | 70 (4.7) |\n| Malignant tumor | 212 (14.1) |\n| Congestive heart failure | 44 (2.9) |\n| Asthma | 118 (7.8) |\n| Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease | 70 (4.7) |\n| Any other heart or lung disease | 304 (20.2) |\n| Diabetes mellitus | 164 (10.9) |\n\n【61】a BMI, body mass index; COVID-19, coronavirus disease; HOUSES, Housing-based Socioeconomic Index; RT-PCR, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.\n\n【62】b Data are presented as mean ± SD or as No. (percentage).\n\n【63】c Chronic illnesses were defined using electronic health records within 1 y of enrollment in the parent study.\n\n【64】### Exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in Study Subjects\n\n【65】Characteristics of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 cases at the time of testing for SARS-CoV-2 are summarized in Table 2 . Only 28 (2%) study subjects reported being exposed to laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases at the time of testing, and most exposures were outside the household (27 \\[96%\\]). One hundred sixty subjects (11%) reported to have at least 1 clinical symptom at the time of testing. One hundred thirty nine participants (9%) were health care workers and 12% had traveled outside Minnesota. Most study subjects (86%)(1,282 \\[86%\\]) resided in a single family home, whereas only 216 participants (14%) resided in multiunit dwellings, mobile home communities, or other group quarters.\n\n【66】Table 2 COVID-19–Related Exposures at the Time of Testing for COVID-19 in Study Participants\n\n【67】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【68】删除21:<u>COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.</u>\n\n【69】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【70】<sup>b</sup>\n\n【71】Data are presented as No. (percentage).\n\n| COVID-19–related exposure | Variable |\n| --- | --- |\n| Close contact (ever)cClose contact was defined as being within ~6 ft (2 m) of another person for a prolonged period of time, which could occur while caring for or living with someone else, visiting, socializing, working, or sharing a health care waiting area.with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases |  |\n| No | 1344 (89.4) |\n| Yes | 28 (1.9) |\n| Unknown | 132 (8.8) |\n| Missing | 1 (0.1) |\n| Relationship with COVID-19 cases among those who had contact with COVID-19 cases |  |\n| Patient in health care setting | 8 (28.6) |\n| Household | 1 (3.6) |\n| Coworker | 5 (17.9) |\n| Other | 14 (50.0) |\n| Self-reported any symptoms within 14 d at the time of screening |  |\n| No | 1297 (89.0) |\n| Yes | 160 (11.0) |\n| Missing | 48 (3.2) |\n| Health care provider (eg, physicians, nurses) |  |\n| No | 1361 (90.7) |\n| Yes | 139 (9.3) |\n| Missing | 5 (0.3) |\n| Been outside Minnesota in the past 14 d |  |\n| No | 1312 (87.6) |\n| Yes | 185 (12.4) |\n| Missing | 8 (0.5) |\n| Been outside the United States in the past 14 d |  |\n| No | 1504 (100) |\n| Yes | 0 (0) |\n| Missing | 1 (0.1) |\n| Primary residence |  |\n| Single family home | 1282 (85.6) |\n| Multiunit dwelling | 199 (13.3) |\n| Nursing home | 4 (0.3) |\n| Room in home (others home) | 0 (0) |\n| Other community dwelling | 13 (0.9) |\n| Missing | 7 (0.5) |\n\n【73】删除21:<u>a COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019.</u>\n\n【74】b Data are presented as No. (percentage).\n\n【75】c _Close contact_ was defined as being within ~6 ft (2 m) of another person for a prolonged period of time, which could occur while caring for or living with someone else, visiting, socializing, working, or sharing a health care waiting area.\n\n【76】### Prevalence of COVID-19 and Characteristics Mitigating the Risk of Transmitting COVID-19\n\n【77】Of the 1505 subjects tested for COVID-19, _none_ came back positive during the study period (May through June 2020). For this unexpected study result, given the multiple individual risk factors (eg, prevalent comorbidities and older age) for COVID-19 in our study subjects, we focused our analyses on identifying factors potentially mitigating the risk of transmitting COVID-19, which may have led to a significant reduction in the burden of COVID-19 cases in our study subjects and community.

One hundred nine (7%) had infections by 1 or more seasonal coronaviruses—HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43—during the flu season (October through April), and 7% had influenza A or B. Influenza vaccination within 1 year before enrollment in the parent study and pneumococcal vaccination ever before enrollment in the parent study were 452 (30%) and 803 (53%), respectively.\n\n【98】Discussion\n----------\n\n【99】To our knowledge, this is the first community-based population surveillance study in a well-defined population after the stay-at-home order was lifted, which comprehensively characterized the study population using clinical, virological, and behavioral data in the United States. Our results indicated that although the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43) in our study cohort (7%) was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season, there were _no COVID-19 cases_ among the 1505 study participants during the study period (between May 8, 2020, and June 30, 2020). Despite the large proportion of study subjects affected by risk factors for COVID-19 (eg, high-risk comorbidities for influenza and older age), _almost all subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures and 86% of participants resided in a single family housing units instead of high-density housing units (eg, apartments). Although our study results were unexpected and did not have a comparative reference group, they nonetheless provide an important insight into the characteristics of a population protected from COVID-19, where such protection is potentially rooted in adherence to public health recommendations and thus would support the current public health recommendations to be more fully implemented at the community, state, and national levels.\n\n【100】Our study results are unexpected given the reported prevalence of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in various study settings including the community. For example, 2 community-based population surveillance studies, which are similar to our study, reported the prevalence of COVID-19 (13 \\[0.6%\\] in a random sample of 2283 residents in Iceland \\[April 1-4\\]\n\n【101】Spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the Icelandic population.\n\n【102】and 1.2% in a sample of 2343 residents of Vo (out of 3275) in Italy \\[February 23-March 8\\]\n\n【103】10.1038/s41586-020-2956-7\\].\n\n【104】) and asymptomatic COVID-19 (7 of 13 \\[54%\\] in the Iceland study and 30 of 73 \\[41%\\] in the Italian study at the time of testing). As our study results were based on self-swab at home, one might be concerned about systematic performance biases (from subject’s specimen collection) leading to potential false negativity. However, during our study, the concordance rates for both respiratory syncytial virus and influenza between self-swab and swab by research staff were 99%. In addition, although it is not part of the present report, our ongoing work assessing the prevalence of COVID-19 during the flu season using the same processes and methods as the present study indeed found a positive case, suggesting that our study findings are unlikely to be due to performance biases or errors leading to false negativity.\n\n【105】Although our study participants overrepresented the White race as a protective factor for COVID-19 raising a selection bias, it is unlikely to account for our study finding. For example, the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections in our study cohort  was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season.\n\n【106】The National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System by US laboratories (117 laboratories reported 854,575 HCoV tests) from July 2014 through June 2017 (ie, pre–COVID-19 pandemic) reported that 2.2% were positive for HCoV-OC43, 1.0% for HCoV-NL63, 0.8% for HCoV-229E, and 0.6% for HCoV-HKU1.\n\n【107】Also, the prevalence of influenza in our study participants during the COVID-19 pandemic was 7% whereas that of an older cohort _during the pre-COVID-19 pandemic was 7%_ .\n\n【108】Our study subjects exhibited a high health care worker rate (9%), which may mean a potentially higher chance of contacting people including patients as essential workers, but also they might have had better personal protective equipment, of which the net effects are unknown but presumably higher for COVID-19.\n\n【109】Our study results provide guidance to communities in terms of how to minimize the spread of COVID-19.\n\n【110】First, as shown in Table 1 , our study cohort encompasses population features representing both reported protective (eg, predominant White race and higher proportion of women) and risk (eg, high frequency of high-risk comorbidities and older age) factors for COVID-19. Apart from these nonmodifiable risk and protective factors, our study results indicated that _almost all study subjects_ followed the recommended public health measures for COVID-19, as shown in Table 3 . The literature suggested that only about 70% to 90% of people followed social distancing policy, depending on age.\n\n【111】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【112】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【113】What protective health measures are Americans taking in response to COVID-19?

Given the current unnecessary skepticism and controversies over current public health recommendations to preventing transmissibility of COVID-19, our study findings based on subjects who were protected from COVID-19 should provide guidance and reinforcement for following the recommended simple public health measures at the community, state, and national levels, as found in recent reports.\n\n【123】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【124】The effect of large-scale anti-contagion policies on the COVID-19 pandemic .\n\n【125】Second, as shown in Table 2 , 86% of our study subjects resided in single family housing units, which is higher than the national average single family homeownership rate (68% in 2020)\n\n【126】and could be another important factor mitigating the risk of COVID-19 as one of the important risk factors for COVID-19 is crowded residential units.\n\n【127】Associations between built environment, neighborhood socioeconomic status, and SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women in New York City.\n\n【128】This finding highlights the importance of at least 1 social determinant of health, such as housing or even arranging a temporary place for isolation or quarantine of the affected family members for those living in crowded residential units (eg, apartments) beyond testing and tracing to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmissibility in the community.\n\n【129】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【130】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【131】Third, as shown in Table 4 , among our study subjects, 8% had seasonal coronavirus infections (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43) during the past flu season (October 2019 through April 2020).

However, we believe that the present single group analysis still provides a valuable insight into the epidemiology of COVID-19 without including an arbitrary reference group. The community prevalence of COVID-19 in this setting is relatively low compared with the national level (68 per 1,000,000 vs 847 per 1,000,000 as of July 1, 2020), so the results may not be generalizable to other study settings. Desirability bias through phone interview might have played a role in the high percentage of adhering to public health measures, although it is unlikely.\n\n【143】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【144】Although the prevalence of non–SARS-CoV-2 infections in our study cohort (7%) was higher than the national average (4%) during the flu season, we did not observe subjects in this cohort testing positive for COVID-19. The combination of participants’ behavior in following the recommended public health measures and a social determinant of health, such as access to a single family housing, may significantly mitigate the risk of COVID-19. The biological effect of the preceding infections with non–SARS-CoV-2 Coronaviridae and its associated preexisting immune reactivity on the risk of COVID-19 remains to be determined.", "index": 21972, "show": true, "start": 21920, "end": 22115, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余标点"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【104】) an"}], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:35:33", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:39:59", "cost": 266.083}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:35", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:39:59", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:35:32"}

Patients were seen from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2018. Injuries were categorized into 3 groups: (1) soft tissue injury, (2) axial nonbony injury, and (3) bony injury. Patients underwent evaluation and were counseled to modify exercise activity.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified 89 patients for inclusion in the study. Within the soft tissue group, 66 patients (74.2%) had mechanical myofascial pain due to overuse. Rotator cuff injury was seen in 6 (6.7%), and trochanteric bursopathy was observed in 1 (1.1%). In the axial group, exacerbation of pain in degenerative joint disease (46 patients \\[51.7%\\]) and facet arthropathy (n=34 \\[38.2%\\]) were observed. Radiculopathy was seen in 5 patients (5.6%). Within the bony injury category, kyphoscoliosis was seen on imaging in 15 patients (16.9%). Spondylolisthesis was present in 15 patients (16.9%). Anterior wedging was seen in 16 (18.0%), and compression fractures were present in 13 (14.6%). The poses that were most commonly identified as causing the injuries involved hyperflexion and hyperextension of the spine.

A significantly increased mortality rate was observed among patients who had cardiac involvement of Wegener granulomatosis found by echocardiography.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】We found a high frequency of echocardiographic abnormalities that appear to be related to Wegener granulomatosis and associated with increased mortality. Because cardiac involvement in Wegener granulomatosis often is silent and associated with increased morbidity and worse prognosis, echocardiographic screening of patients with active Wegener granulomatosis may be of clinical value.", "index": 239, "show": true, "start": 239, "end": 478, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:32:44", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:33:03", "cost": 18.651}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:35", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:33:03", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:32:44"}

All influenza vaccinations administered during the period of August 1 to April 30 for influenza seasons 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014 were identified. We compared the risk of outcomes of interest between those who received influenza vaccination during their hospitalization vs those who were never vaccinated that season or were vaccinated at other times using propensity score analyses with inverse probability of treatment weighting. Outcomes of interest included rates of outpatient and emergency department visits, readmissions, fever, and clinical laboratory evaluations for infection (urine, blood, and wound culture; complete blood cell count) in the 7 days following discharge.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We included in the study 290,149 hospitalizations among 255,737 patients.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has further tested Mayo Clinic’s approach to leadership and has highlighted some of its greatest leadership strengths: physician leadership, the physician-administrator partnership, and collaborative problem solving and decision-making via the Clinical Practice Committee (CPC). In this commentary, we reflect on these strengths and describe how they have helped Mayo Clinic successfully respond to the pandemic.\n\n【3】The Physician-Administrator Partnership\n---------------------------------------\n\n【4】John Herrell, a former Chief Administrative Officer for Mayo Clinic, once stated, “Physicians are responsible and accountable for the success of the institution,” and “Administrators are responsible and accountable to our physician colleagues to help make that happen.”\n\n【5】The essence of an effective physician-administrator partnership is a joint commitment to these roles. Mayo Clinic’s approach is compelling — a partnership in which both disciplines jointly lead. The physician brings clinical expertise and vision to the decision-making process and the administrator leverages business skill and acumen. Among the many skill sets required of an administrator, a strategic one is the ability to create and ensure effective connections. The role of the connector is critical for integrating diverse teams that can overcome risks and quickly define new pathways. Each perspective is essential and interdependent, and this shared physician-administrator model of leadership has reinforced Mayo Clinic’s long-term success.\n\n【6】Role of the CPC\n---------------\n\n【7】Harry Harwick, Mayo Clinic’s first administrator, said, “One of the strongest convictions of the doctors Mayo was that the combined wisdom of a man’s peers is greater than that of any individual.”\n\n【8】Harwick added, “The first and perhaps greatest lesson I learned from the Mayos was that of teamwork.”\n\n【9】The CPC is the manifestation of the Mayo brothers’ commitment to teamwork. Members of the CPC collaborate to deliver a single, integrated, high-value, high-quality practice that promotes innovation and differentiation. In partnership with executive leaders, research leaders, and education leaders from the Mayo Clinic campuses, the CPC enables the organization to achieve its clinical priorities. In a time of crisis, the CPC leads operationally through an empowered model of decision-making, timely escalation of concerns, and optimization of performance metrics.\n\n【10】The Administrator’s Role in a Pandemic\n--------------------------------------\n\n【11】Health care administrators are uniquely skilled and positioned to manage complex problems. They are highly qualified to mitigate immediate risks to the institution yet to remain aligned to mid-term and long-term organizational strategies. Health care administrators also serve to identify and respond to unique opportunities that the crisis presents, creating the capacity for innovation and new solutions.\n\n【12】For example, a shift in the regulatory environment facilitated extension and acceleration of telehealth capabilities that had been developed over the past several years, dramatically increasing the ability to serve patients remotely through virtual visits and monitoring of high-risk patients in their homes. Technology also allowed Mayo Clinic to extend knowledge in new ways such as by making the Ask Mayo Expert COVID-19 tool publicly available, leveraging our research collaborations to broaden availability of the latest therapies and protocols, and using our education infrastructure to widely share our knowledge and expertise.\n\n【13】Challenges also drove substantial innovations in problem solving, including use of three-dimensional printing, partnering with manufacturers, and developing protocols for extended use and reprocessing of personal protective equipment. The administrator’s ability to be a connector during this phase was essential for aligning work towards a common goal, prioritizing risks, and developing effective and efficient teams able to mitigate risks within the organization. Problem-focused, cross-departmental teams were quickly formed and included members from supply chain, human resources, patient access, information technology, electronic health record, revenue cycle, analytics, and other functions.\n\n【14】On March 23, 2020, the clinical practice elected to pause visits for both inpatients and outpatients, including surgery and other procedures, for those patients whose care could be safely deferred. This decision was based on a risk model that included an assessment of level of care (from elective to emergent), the level of virus transmission within local communities, and the operational status of each hospital (from conventional to crisis care). At the same time, Mayo Clinic maintained a commitment to continue critical services for patients requiring access to care. This balance required administrative teams working as connectors to ensure that processes, resources, and systems were in place to support staff and patients.\n\n【15】Core to the decisions during the COVID-19 pandemic was a focus on Mayo Clinic values, the needs of patients, and a commitment to employees. Pausing care substantially affected patients and staff but served to provide for organizational stability. This decision afforded needed time to prepare and mitigate risks of a surge, refine protocols for staff and patient safety, ensure sufficient supply availability and protocols, and implement laboratory testing protocols. During this time, technology infrastructure was improved to support increased telehealth services and movement of nonessential staff to remote work in order to reduce the volume of staff onsite. These steps allowed for a successful reactivation of the practice with a thoughtful and balanced approach that matched resources, staffing, and alignment to our values, and provided a safer environment for patients and staff. Additionally, these steps allow for continued monitoring and thoughtful adjustments based on COVID-19 prevalence within each community.\n\n【16】The Importance of Communication\n-------------------------------\n\n【17】Harry Harwick emphasized the importance of being “well equipped to interpret the public’s reaction to medicine and its practitioners” and of how “the greatest single problem of the executive is to learn the pertinent facts of a given situation, the facts he must have to make his decision.”\n\n【18】This need is exponentially elevated during periods of human, social, and economic crisis. An effective administrator is a continual communicator — aware of the external environment, attuned to the needs of patients and staff, and skilled at using verbal and written tools to connect staff to answers and solutions.\n\n【19】The current era of enhanced connectivity and infinite access to data has given institutions unique ways to connect with employees, communities, and individuals throughout the world. During the early days of the pandemic, decision-making at Mayo Clinic was expedited and modified as information quickly evolved. This required frequent, clear, and transparent communications that supported a sense of calm and esprit de corps. Administrators handled shifts in external environments, including governmental guidance, and ensured frequent opportunities for bidirectional communication through various methods, including virtual town halls that welcomed unfiltered questions, podcasts, private Facebook groups, and newsletters. Through unabridged communication, an administrator can efficiently monitor tactics to evaluate success, progress, and failures to guide future actions.\n\n【20】In summary, the role of the administrator in a pandemic is as a collaborative partner, servant-leader, effective communicator, and connector. Even with a strong leadership model, Mayo Clinic is not immune to external disruptions. The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged us, but it will not break us. Together, as one strengthened union of forces, we will advance our capabilities and commitment to transforming medicine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:31:45", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:32:05", "cost": 20.258}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:35", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:32:05", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:31:45"}

He had a history of episodic back pain dating to his mid-20s, but the cause had never been determined. Unlike his prior episodes, on this occasion he first noticed the discomfort after what he thought was a flulike illness, characterized by fevers, chills, myalgia, malaise, and headache, as well as a 6.8-kg unintended weight loss. Although his constitutional symptoms had largely resolved in the week before his presentation, his lower back pain continued to worsen and began radiating to the perineum. His pain increased when he lay flat and was partially alleviated when he walked. The pain was generally worst at night and was accompanied by morning stiffness. He reported no focal weakness, bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, or history of uveitis, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, or sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【1】On physical examination, he was afebrile, and other vital signs were within normal limits. He had marked tenderness to palpation of the left sacroiliac (SI) joint. Results of a FABER (flexion, abduction, external rotation) test were positive on the left side, and a straight leg raise yielded negative results bilaterally. There were no cutaneous lesions, enthesitis, or ocular findings. His neurologic, cardiopulmonary, abdominal, and geniturinary tract examination findings were also unremarkable. Despite a trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the patient’s pain persisted for the next several weeks, and follow-up was arranged. At that time, his symptoms and physical examination findings were largely unchanged. Laboratory studies revealed the following (reference ranges given parenthetically): white blood cell count, 7.3 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L (3.5-10.5 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L); erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 34 mm/h (0-22 mm/h); and C-reactive protein, 13.2 mg/dL (<8 mg/dL). Results of an HLA-B27 antigen test were positive.\n\n【2】*   1.\n\n【3】    **Given the information obtained thus far, which _one_ of the following raises the posttest probability of ankylosing spondylitis _most_ substantially?**\n\n【4】    *   a.\n\n【5】        HLA-B27 positivity\n\n【6】    *   b.\n\n【7】        Features of inflammatory lower back pain\n\n【8】    *   c.\n\n【9】        Elevated acute-phase reactant\n\n【10】    *   d.\n\n【11】        No response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n\n【12】    *   e.\n\n【13】        Sudden onset of lower back pain\n\n【14】To better standardize the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, several classification criteria have been developed, including the modified New York, Amor, and Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society criteria. The sensitivity and specificity of the individual parameters within these criteria vary vastly. Owing to this variability, likelihood ratios (LRs) have been assigned to the clinical and laboratory parameters to assist in determining disease probability before ordering more advanced studies.\n\n【15】In this case, the most appropriate option is HLA-B27 positivity, which confers a positive LR of 9. The inflammatory lower back pain (LR, 3.1) and elevated acute-phase reactants (LR, 2.5) also increase the likelihood of ankylosing spondylitis but to a lesser degree. Taken together, the presence of just these 3 variables increases the posttest probability to 78%, assuming a pretest probability of 4.6%, which is the reported rate of ankylosing spondylitis in primary care patients who have long-term lower back pain.\n\n【16】Patients with ankylosing spondylitis are expected to have a good response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs rather than no response. The back pain experienced by those who have ankylosing spondylitis is generally long-term rather than short-term and has an age at onset of less than 45 years.\n\n【17】The patient continued to experience lower back pain despite 2 weeks of conservative therapy and requested stronger pain relief and further evaluation.\n\n【18】*   2.\n\n【19】    **Which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ next step in evaluating the etiology of this patient’s lower back pain?**\n\n【20】    *   a.\n\n【21】        Defer imaging unless back pain continues for 6 weeks despite conservative therapy\n\n【22】    *   b.\n\n【23】        Plain radiography\n\n【24】    *   c.\n\n【25】        Immediate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis/lumbosacral spine\n\n【26】    *   d.\n\n【27】        Computed tomography (CT) of the spine\n\n【28】    *   e.\n\n【29】        Corticosteroid injection\n\n【30】In the presence of substantial risk factors for ankylosing spondylitis and a failed trial of conservative therapy, imaging is the most appropriate next step, and the question becomes which study to obtain. Unlike imaging for myofascial back pain, ankylosing spondylitis imaging should not be delayed for an additional 6 weeks. Plain radiography is the criterion standard and is generally indicated because it is very sensitive for established disease that has caused damage to the SI joint. It has the additional benefits of greater accessibility and lower cost compared with MRI. However, MRI has greater capacity for assessing active inflammation and early sacroiliitis, but its role in evaluating long-term disease is still unclear. For this reason, many argue that plain film radiography is always indicated.\n\n【31】A CT scan may result in improved detection of long-term damage at the SI joint compared with radiography, but it is not used routinely because of the increased radiation exposure. Immediately sending the patient for corticosteroid injections would further delay diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【32】Plain radiography of the pelvis revealed irregular widening of the left SI joint. Much milder widening was noted in the right SI joint also. With concern for sacroiliitis related to ankylosing spondylitis, the patient was referred to rheumatology specialists. Given his recent history of fevers and chills and asymmetric widening of the SI joint evident on radiography, the decision was made to obtain MRI, which revealed severe left sacroiliitis with erosive changes and reactive edema within the adjacent soft tissues. There was confluent T1 marrow replacement in the adjacent iliac bone and sacrum, along with marked T2 hyperintense thickening and peripheral enhancement of the left S3 nerve root.\n\n【33】*   3.\n\n【34】    **On the basis of the patient’s MRI and clinical findings, which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ next step?**\n\n【35】    *   a.\n\n【36】        Obtain blood cultures\n\n【37】    *   b.\n\n【38】        Obtain blood cultures and start empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics\n\n【39】    *   c.\n\n【40】        Biopsy of the SI joint under CT guidance\n\n【41】    *   d.\n\n【42】        Screen for hepatitis B and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); if results are negative, start tumor necrosis factor inhibitor\n\n【43】    *   e.\n\n【44】        Screen for rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies\n\n【45】This patient has severe sacroiliitis, and differentiating infectious sacroiliitis from sacroiliitis associated with an axial spondyloarthritis is of paramount importance. On MRI, the patient has erosive intra-articular changes at the SI joint, and bone marrow edema—common features of both entities. However, the imaging findings of unilateral sacroiilitis, sacral distribution of bone marrow edema, and periarticular muscle edema greatly increase suspicion of infection.\n\n【46】Unilateral sacroiliitis: differential diagnosis between infectious sacroiliitis and spondyloarthritis based on MRI Findings.\n\n【47】The next task becomes a targeted microbiologic confirmation of the pathogen. Blood cultures have much lower yield than CT-guided biopsy. If an infection is confirmed, starting antibiotics would be appropriate but premature at this time and would decrease the yield of biopsy. Although anti–tumor necrosis factor agents can slow progression to permanent structural damage in ankylosing spondylitis, starting it before infection has been ruled out is inappropriate. Finally, screening for rheumatoid factor and anti–citrullinated protein antibodies does not address the immediate and serious concern of infection suggested by MRI.\n\n【48】Examination of this patient’s biopsy samples revealed chronic and granulomatous inflammation. No evidence of malignancy was found, and results of Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver stain were negative. A special stain for acid-fast bacilli yielded positive results, and cultures from the joint fluid and tissue eventually grew _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ (TB) complex. Quantiferon testing for TB was positive, with a TB antigen value of 10.72 IU/mL.\n\n【49】Of note, this patient had immigrated to the United States from Vietnam with his wife and children 6 months before his initial presentation. At that time, he was evaluated by the Department of Homeland Security for standard communicable diseases of public health relevance. A tuberculin purified protein derivative skin test was administered, producing a reaction size of 10 mm. This test was followed by chest radiography, which revealed no evidence of active pulmonary TB. To our knowledge, he did not receive treatment for latent TB.\n\n【50】*   4.\n\n【51】    **For the described HIV-negative patient from Vietnam without a history of bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination or known TB exposures, which _one_ of the following is the threshold at which a tuberculin purified protein derivative skin test result should be considered _positive_ ?**\n\n【52】    *   a.\n\n【53】        2.5 mm\n\n【54】    *   b.\n\n【55】        5 mm\n\n【56】    *   c.\n\n【57】        7 mm\n\n【58】    *   d.\n\n【59】        10 mm\n\n【60】    *   e.\n\n【61】        15 mm\n\n【62】Interpretation of tuberculin skin testing on the basis of risk factors is important and is commonly tested on licensing and board certification examinations. Had the patient been HIV-positive, immunosuppressed, or had recent contact with active TB disease, the threshold would be reduced to 5 mm. The correct threshold is 10 mm for a recent immigrant (<5 y) from a country with a high TB prevalence. An induration of 15 mm or more is positive for TB regardless of TB risk factors. Previous bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccination can cause false-positive tuberculin skin test results.\n\n【63】Official American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention clinical practice guidelines: diagnosis of tuberculosis in adults and children.\n\n【64】The patient was referred to infectious disease specialists who reported his case to local county public health officials. We initiated directly observed therapy with rifampin, isoniazid, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. Orthopedic surgery specialists also evaluated the patient but did not believe that surgical irrigation and debridement was indicated.\n\n【65】Before initiating therapy, we obtained baseline measurements of serum aminotransferase, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine levels and a platelet count, all of which were within normal limits. Additionally, the patient underwent screening for HIV, which yielded negative results. Because ethambutol would be included in his treatment, visual acuity and red and green color discrimination were tested as well.\n\n【66】Two weeks after treatment initiation, culture results indicated pan-susceptibility, and ethambutol was therefore discontinued, with continuation of rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide. Four weeks into treatment, the patient’s back pain had decreased; however, he returned to the clinic with numbness and tingling in both hands. Isoniazid-related neuropathy was suspected, and pyridoxine (vitamin B <sub>6 </sub> ) therapy was initiated. Despite this measure, his neurologic symptoms continued, prompting discontinuation of pyrazinamide in favor of reinitiation of ethambutol, along with continued rifampin and isoniazid.\n\n【67】*   5.\n\n【68】    **Given that this patient had no baseline laboratory or visual abnormalities, which _one_ of the following should be regularly assessed for the duration of his treatment?**\n\n【69】    *   a.\n\n【70】        Liver function\n\n【71】    *   b.\n\n【72】        Serum creatinine\n\n【73】    *   c.\n\n【74】        Platelet count\n\n【75】    *   d.\n\n【76】        Signs of visual disturbances\n\n【77】    *   e.\n\n【78】        Sputum specimen for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, at monthly intervals\n\n【79】Baseline evaluation of hepatic function, renal function, platelet count, and testing of visual acuity and red and green color discrimination should be performed for all patients before initiation of anti-TB therapy. Patients then require monthly clinical assessments for adverse effects of the medications, including questioning for hepatotoxicity, which may manifest with nausea, emesis, or right upper quadrant pain. Should a patient be at increased risk of hepatic toxicity, as from alcohol abuse or chronic hepatitis, for example, liver function should be monitored routinely to ensure that the liver disease does not worsen. The same is true for those who have baseline kidney disease or thrombocytopenia. All patients, regardless of their initial laboratory test results, should be questioned at monthly intervals about visual symptoms which may result from ethambutol. During treatment of patients who have active pulmonary TB, sputum specimens for acid-fast bacilli smears and cultures should be obtained monthly until results are negative for 2 consecutive months, but smears and cultures are not performed routinely for patients with extrapulmonary TB.\n\n【80】Official American Thoracic Society/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis.\n\n【81】Repeated MRI at 6 months revealed marked improvement in the inflammatory and reactive changes surrounding the joint but interval worsening of the destructive changes within the joint that occurred as a consequence of infection. These destructive changes were thought to represent a delayed radiographic response, given the normalization of inflammatory markers and clinical improvement. Three-drug therapy with ethambutol, rifampin, and isoniazid was therefore continued for 9 months total, at which time results of repeated clinical, laboratory, and imaging evaluations were reassuring, allowing discontinuation of therapy.\n\n【82】Discussion\n----------\n\n【83】_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ remains a global health priority, with 9.6 million new cases and 1.5 million TB-related deaths in 2014 alone.\n\n【84】The numbers are particularly tragic because the condition is treatable and often curable with early recognition. The diagnosis, however, requires a high index of suspicion, as TB has long been known for its ability to imitate other disorders. Most cases of TB in the United States occur in foreign-born individuals.\n\n【85】A critical clue in this case was the patient’s recent immigration from Vietnam, a country designated by the World Health Organization as one of 22 countries with a “high burden,” a label given to places with 100 or more TB cases per 100,000 population. Countries in the top 5 for number of incident cases are India, Indonesia, China, Pakistan, and South Africa. In total, 86% of cases occur in patients from Asian and African regions.\n\n【86】Awareness of the atypical manifestations is of growing importance in industrialized countries where extrapulmonary TB accounts for an increasing proportion of the total cases. Currently, nearly 20% of all TB cases in US national surveillance data are extrapulmonary, with a contribution of 11% from bone and joint sites.\n\n【87】Osteoarticular TB can present in any skeletal location, but the aerobic, acid-fast bacilli have a predilection for areas with abundant vascularity, including the spine and long bones of weight-bearing joints such as the knee and hip. Unlike infections from other microbes, osteoarticular TB tends to present in a subacute to chronic fashion. Pain and swelling may be the only signs of infection and may precede inflammatory features such as erythema and warmth by weeks.\n\n【88】Even constitutional symptoms and fever may not be present.\n\n【89】Patients with skeletal TB are unlikely to have primary pulmonary involvement at the same time; rather, it is usually due to reactivation of latent TB. An interesting consideration in the presented case is the patient’s long-standing history of lower back pain with inflammatory features suggestive of ankylosing spondylitis. A body of literature indicates that patients with rheumatologic conditions are at increased risk of infection because of their immunocompromised state, even before the initiation of medication that can further suppress their response to infection.\n\n【90】In addition, skeletal TB has been described in association with systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and even superimposed on gouty arthritis. However, given that our patient is of Southeast Asian descent, it should be noted that the distribution of HLA-B27 antigen is the lowest in equatorial areas and that certain subtypes of HLA-B27 antigen may not be associated with ankylosing spondylitis in Asians.\n\n【91】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【92】Association of HLA-B27 genetic polymorphisms with ankylosing spondylitis susceptibility worldwide: a meta-analysis.\n\n【93】One possibility is that his HLA-B27 antigen positivity was a “red herring.”\n\n【94】Testing with the Mantoux tuberculin skin test or interferon gamma release assay can help indicate whether a patient has a cellular immune response to TB. Further laboratory testing does not aid in the diagnosis of active extrapulmonary TB, as the white blood cell count and inflammatory markers may be normal or only mildly elevated. As discussed previously, imaging characteristics can be suggestive of bone and joint infections, but definitive diagnosis requires biopsy and cultures. On the biopsy sample, smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and nucleic acid amplification testing are useful for rapid detection of _M tuberculosis_ , but confirmation with mycobacterial cultures and drug susceptibility testing are essential for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Emerging nuclear acid amplification testing methods (ie, GeneXpert MTB/RIF™ \\[ _M tuberculosis/_ rifampin\\]) can detect resistance to rifampin and other agents within a matter of hours, but complete susceptibility testing still relies on conventional mycobacterial cultures, which may take weeks.\n\n【95】Treatment for extrapulmonary TB should be coordinated with local public health officials and in consultation with local or regional authorities. Treatment for all forms of pan-susceptible, active TB is administered in 2 phases—an 8-week initiation phase, typically consisting of treatment with pyrazinamide, rifampin, ethambutol, and isoniazid, followed by a longer continuation phase. Extrapulmonary pan-susceptible disease is generally treated with a continuation phase of 4 to 7 months, although this period is extended to 12 months for TB meningitis or other advanced disease.\n\n【96】Official American Thoracic Society/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guidelines: treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis.\n\n【97】Directly observed therapy is critical to minimize the chances of treatment failure, relapse, and emergence of drug resistance. Rates of relapse for TB sacroiliitis depend on treatment selection, duration, isolate susceptibility, adherence to therapy, and clinical characteristics, and they are estimated only imprecisely in the current literature. Surgical intervention is frequently necessary, particularly in cases of TB sacroiliitis.\n\n【98】Tuberculous sacroiliitis: a study of the diagnosis, therapy and medium-term results of 15 cases.\n\n【99】However, for patients with pan-sensitive TB sacroiliitis who receive adequate therapy, favorable outcomes with no relapse can be expected.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:30:20", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:31:46", "cost": 86.027}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:35", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:31:46", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:30:20"}

The broader term _purpura fulminans_ has been used, but it does not adequately describe this specific scenario. Any condition that critically diminishes the blood, nutrient, or oxygen supply to acral areas for a prolonged period can lead to peripheral symmetrical gangrene. The commonest cause is disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), most often secondary to infection. Another documented cause is use of vasopressors. The gangrene may be a manifestation of multiple organ system failure. Gangrene of the distal extremities is common. Other acral areas may be involved, such as the nose, ears, or vertex of the scalp. In the setting of DIC, hemorrhagic patches may coexist with the peripheral gangrene.\n\n【1】Although peripheral symmetrical gangrene has been described for decades,\n\n【2】information dealing with its management is scant. Therapeutic alternatives are largely anecdotal and are not based on controlled clinical trials. No specific treatment has been shown to consistently prevent progression or to reverse the gangrene. Management of underlying causes is crucial. Disseminated intravascular coagulation should be corrected as appropriate; its cause should be delineated and treated aggressively. Precipitating or exacerbating factors, such as vasopressor therapy (eg, dopamine infusion), should be eliminated if possible.

Relevant issues unclear in the database were studied in an additional 335 patients with locally advanced disease treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In the multivariable analysis, a significant interaction was found between tumor size and LN involvement ( _P_ <.001). In LN-negative diseases, the relationship between tumor size and BCSM was piecewise. Using 21- to 30-mm tumors as the reference, the hazard ratio (HR) of BCSM increased with increasing tumor size until a peak at 41 to 50 mm (HR, 1.49; _P_ <.001), after which increasing tumor size was unexpectedly related to decreasing hazard, with a nadir at 61 to 80 mm (HR, 1.06; _P_ \\=.70). The 61- to 80-mm tumors exhibited a significantly lower BCSM compared with the 41- to 50-mm ( _P_ \\=.02) and greater than 80-mm ( _P_ \\=.03) subgroups. This pattern remained after stratification by estrogen receptor status but was not observed in patients with LN-positive disease. Further analysis indicated that the survival advantage of 61- to 80-mm tumors in LN-negative disease might result from its low risk of distant metastasis.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】A relatively larger tumor size without LN involvement may be a surrogate for biologically indolent disease of distant metastasis. Our findings, if validated in other large databases, may provide better understanding of breast cancer biology.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AJCC ( American Joint Committee on Cancer ), BCSM ( breast cancer–specific mortality ), DRFS ( distant relapse-free survival ), ER ( estrogen receptor ), FDSCC ( Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center ), HR ( hazard ratio ), LN ( lymph node ), NCT ( neoadjuvant chemotherapy ), pCR ( pathological complete remission ), PR ( progesterone receptor ), RFS ( relapse-free survival ), SEER ( Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:45:50", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:46:46", "cost": 55.935}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:35", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:46:45", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:45:49"}

The categories of wrongness Meagher et al identify would be addressed. Could we then be confident that this first-in-human germline use of CRISPR was ethical? And if so, ethical by whose definition?\n\n【9】If these conditions of our thought experiment were secured, the 2018 hubbub might not have drawn the scorn it did. Some might still express vague concern to slow down, hoping to further examine the “implications” and “issues” this technology raises. Others might call for ethics to be “embedded” within the science going forward to “ensure” “responsible translation.” Maybe the ethics needs to just “catch up” with the science. Such is a common refrain for many emerging technologies. But within the ethical framework of the establishment, there would be little left to say about the moral permissibility of CRISPR or any other technology besides the precedence and procedure of the establishment.\n\n【10】I am a practicing physician. I see patients who read the news, express genuine moral concern about the world including science, and do not know what to think about topics ranging from Trump to climate change, to CBD (cannabidiol), to stem cells. Many of my patients know I write about and teach ethics. And it is in the clinic where I wonder how well the categories of wrongness from Meagher et al will resonate with a broad range of patients whose moral intuitions, though not ignorant to precedence and procedure, stretch far beyond those categories. So, it is with my clinical hat on that a bit of skepticism creeps in, not about the necessity of the categories of wrongness they outline but about the sufficiency of those categories for patients.\n\n【11】Practicing clinicians hoping to summarize and render something thoughtful to say to a broad range of patients about a complex emerging field may want to at least name categories of ethical concern beyond consent, risk assessment, peer review, and conflict of interest. The 2 examples are sacredness as well as desire and its relationship to finitude.\n\n【12】Suppose public and scientific debate were to regularly include the category of “sacredness” in ethics conversations on par with how we currently invoke concepts such as “risk” and “choice.” Surely, that would make ethics messier, but ethics is and arguably ought to be messy. Sacredness is a category explicitly invoked by conservatives in policy discussions surrounding the margins of life germane to germline gene editing. Liberals too invoke a version of sacredness, perhaps more implicitly, when discussing fracking, drilling, protecting public lands, genetically modified foods, agricultural sustainability, and oil spills. Researchers of any political ilk working with our American Indian and Alaska Native neighbors must take sacredness seriously to address the needs of their people. As a sociological matter, sacredness is an inconvenient yet crucially relevant category to the language of wrongness that the scientific establishment avoids at its peril.\n\n【13】Similarly, consider the categories of desire and finitude in these debates. These rarely make it into the establishment lexicon of moral analysis. Yet, even in the absence of scandal, CRISPR sure looks like one more episode in an ongoing saga of humanity’s desperate encounter with its own finitude. Tempted by the desire to control our destinies under the guise of “progress,” we humans instrumentalize and then manipulate the “building blocks” of our finite human bodies. We fall for CRISPR like we fall for other ways to (transiently) overcome our finitude, be they iPhones, Alexa, or self-parking cars. “If we _can_ do X ‘safely,’ then why wouldn’t we?” Whether it is engineering a human immunodeficiency virus–resistant baby or buying a better toaster, the struggle is the same. Over time, our collective fascination with new discrete technological fixes does not just prompt occasional “bad apple” abuses, it blinds us to more fundamental categories of rightness and wrongness such as misaligned desires, hubris, and control. Good ethics requires we recall Faust and Orwell, not just Kant and Mill. The language of consent, risk, due process, and conflict disclosure alone falsely reassures us while implicitly and unwittingly censuring a vocabulary that names the deeper influences on our collective choices.\n\n【14】Over time the instrumental and myopic nature of technology’s march could blunt our ability to plausibly invoke moral categories such as “sacredness” or our ability to see the finitude-fueled drivers of our desires. Moreover, merely saying the equivalent of “smart people from the government and academia are looking into this stuff” may not have the trust-engendering effect for which Meagher et al hope at least not with a broad range of patients. Will endorsing existing procedural norms of the establishment alone engender public trust in science? I suspect not. Some of my patients would scarcely call these categories ethics at all.\n\n【15】To be fair, no one article can outline every category of ethical concern. We should not hold these or any authors to such standards. Yet, if I were a philosopher-king of the ethics universe, I would swiftly offer a hearty “Amen” to the need for better transparency, self-regulation, and oversight for gene editing and related technologies offered by Meagher et al. Then, I would declare (kings can do that) that these and similar transgressions prompt deeper, harder conversations about where our judgments of wrongness come from and what it might take to deepen our moral discourse with our patients and our neighbors.\n\n【16】This broadening of categories may reopen conversations about if/when technologies as routine as in vitro fertilization are morally justified and whether new innovations such as uterine transplant are in fact the poster child of “responsible translation.” That could make conversations more sticky and complicated than a 20-minute office visit will allow, and physicians cannot necessarily claim expertise on these questions. Yet, somewhere, in some context would it not be reasonable to note that in vitro fertilization in the course of 40 years has instrumentalized procreation, fed public appetite for engineered parenting, and helped spur anxiety that old fashioned adoption may not be the most “authentic” parenting experience. Now uterine transplant seems to have fed into desires and even entitlement to a particular “gestational experience” under the clinical guise of “absolute uterine factor infertility.” Whatever we might say about “responsible translation,” there is much more to say about these practices than the scientific establishment would invite or expect. We need a different, richer vocabulary to discuss the rightness and wrongness not just of CRISPR but of the insidious urge to control and manipulate human nature in our late modern moment.\n\n【17】In a 1999 article “The idea of progress and the goals of medicine,” Mark J.

Collins—Human Genome Project\nThe American physician-geneticist Francis Sellers Collins became the second director of the National Center for Human Genome Research in April 1993. The position had been vacated the year before by James D. Watson (1928-), the Nobel laureate who codiscovered the chemical structure of DNA in 1953. As director of the Human Genome Project, Collins oversees a 15-year endeavor to completely map and sequence human DNA by 2005. Many scientists and medical researchers consider this project the most important scientific undertaking of our time. The work of the publicly funded Human Genome Project led by Collins complemented the work of the privately funded Human Genome Project led by J. Craig Venter (1946-) of Celera Genomics (Rockville, MD). Their cooperative efforts led to the simultaneous reporting of their data (Collins' work in _Nature_ , February 15, 2001, and Venter's work in _Science_ , February 16, 2001). Sequencing of the human genome represents the beginning of a new approach in biology and a new way of analyzing human disease. In 2000, the African country of Ghana issued a souvenir stamp (Scott No. 2215) that called attention to the Human Genome Project. This issuance provides an opportunity to honor Dr Francis S.

His father had a PhD degree in English, taught at a local college, and raised livestock on the family farm. Collins was home-schooled by his mother until he entered 6th grade. While in high school, Collins became interested in chemistry. In 1966, at the age of 16 years, he entered the University of Virginia at Charlottesville and received a BS degree in chemistry in 1970. After receiving his baccalaureate degree, Collins enrolled at Yale University in New Haven, CT and received a PhD degree in physical chemistry in 1974. Collins was encouraged by Walter Gilbert (1932-), a future (1980) Nobel laureate in chemistry who had abandoned a promising career as a physicist to concentrate on molecular biology.

Collins—Human Genome Project\nThe American physician-geneticist Francis Sellers Collins became the second director of the National Center for Human Genome Research in April 1993. The position had been vacated the year before by James D. Watson (1928-), the Nobel laureate who codiscovered the chemical structure of DNA in 1953. As director of the Human Genome Project, Collins oversees a 15-year endeavor to completely map and sequence human DNA by 2005. Many scientists and medical researchers consider this project the most important scientific undertaking of our time. The work of the publicly funded Human Genome Project led by Collins complemented the work of the privately funded Human Genome Project led by J. Craig Venter (1946-) of Celera Genomics (Rockville, MD). Their cooperative efforts led to the simultaneous reporting of their data (Collins' work in _Nature_ , February 15, 2001, and Venter's work in _Science_ , February 16, 2001). Sequencing of the human genome represents the beginning of a new approach in biology and a new way of analyzing human disease. In 2000, the African country of Ghana issued a souvenir stamp (Scott No. 2215) that called attention to the Human Genome Project. This issuance provides an opportunity to honor Dr Francis S.

However, despite his reputation as “New England’s hermit,” Thoreau traveled frequently. His last and longest journey was to Minnesota.\n\n【1】Thoreau was born David Henry Thoreau in Concord on July 12, 1817, and began calling himself “Henry David” after graduating from Harvard College in 1837. His father, John, was a pencil manufacturer; his mother, Cynthia Dunbar, was the daughter of Asa Dunbar, who led the “Butter Rebellion” over poor quality college food while a Harvard student in 1766 – the earliest recorded American student protest.\n\n【2】After graduation and a brief period working in the family pencil business, Henry Thoreau taught grammar school with his older brother John (until John's death of tetanus in 1842) and later worked as a land surveyor.\n\n【3】On May 11, 1861, a month after the Civil War began with an attack on Fort Sumter, Thoreau departed Concord accompanied by a family friend, 17-year-old Horace Mann, Jr. Thoreau was suffering from consumption (ie, tuberculosis), with which he had first been diagnosed in the mid-1830s while at Harvard College. He had been unwell since contracting bronchitis in 1860, allegedly after a late-night walk counting tree stumps in a rainstorm. His physicians advised him to go to the Mediterranean, Caribbean, or the Mississippi Valley to try and recuperate in a different climate – a common recommendation for tuberculosis during that era.\n\n【4】Thoreau chose Minnesota, writing to a friend, “It will be most expedient for me to try the air of Minnesota, say somewhere about St. Paul’s.” At the time, Minnesota was a sparsely populated “frontier” state, and the bracing continental climate of the Northern Plains was considered health-promoting.\n\n【5】Thoreau’s journey to Minnesota for health purposes is echoed in the migration of William Worrall Mayo (1819-1911), founder of Mayo Clinic. In 1854, after W.W. Mayo had been in practice in the Wabash River valley near Lafayette, Indiana, for several years, he grew tired of treating patients with “fever and ague” (ie, malaria) and weary of getting malaria himself. He hitched up his wagon and headed west out of town, telling his wife Louise, “I'm going to keep on driving until I get well or die.”\n\n【6】删除21:<u>Mayo ended up in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he attempted to develop a medical practice. However, there were already several physicians in St. Paul who were well established before Mayo arrived, and the patients he did see often could not pay him, so Mayo found it impossible to develop a practice that would support his family. Mayo then moved to a farm in the Minnesota River Valley near Le Seuer. In 1863, he was named the examining surgeon of the draft enrollment board for the 1st Minnesota District and moved to Rochester. Mayo's first son, William James, was born in June of 1861 (coincidentally, while Thoreau was traveling nearby in Minnesota). William's brother Charles Horace Mayo would follow in 1865.</u>\n\n【7】On May 23, 1861, after brief stops to visit Niagara Falls, Detroit, and Chicago, Henry Thoreau and Horace Mann Jr, arrived at the Mississippi River near East Dubuque, Illinois, and boarded the steamboat _Itasca_ headed upriver. Three days later, they reached St. Paul, and spent the next two weeks exploring Lake Calhoun, Lake Harriet, and Minnehaha Falls with Minnesota state geologist Charles Anderson. Thoreau was particularly interested in prairie gophers and wild crabapples.\n\n【8】Coincidentally, the visitors came across an advertisement in a Minneapolis newspaper offering a 6-day excursion down the Minnesota River. For $10, paying guests could join Minnesota Governor Alexander Ramsey (1815-1903) on the steamboat _Frank Steele_ to the Lower Sioux Agency reservation in Redwood County. The occasion of this trip was the annual distribution of a 50-year annuity payment from the US Government to the Mdewakanton Dakota Indians, as outlined in the 1851 Treaty of Mendota.\n\n【9】Thoreau noted that the Indians spoke eloquently but looked unhappy, especially their leader, Little Crow. Disputes over the annuity and insensitive handling of food sales by the US Indian Agents contributed to the Dakota War of 1862, of which Little Crow was a leader. The climax of the Dakota War was the “Battle of New Ulm” in August 1862, where W.W. Mayo distinguished himself as a field surgeon. During his 1861 journey to the reservation, Thoreau was disappointed not to see a bison, though he was fascinated to walk 3 miles on the prairie and not see a single tree.\n\n【10】删除21:<u>Thoreau's companion on his Minnesota journey was the son of Horace Mann, the leading proponent of public education in America, who had died in 1859 while on a trip to Antioch College in Ohio.

Despite extensive evaluation, is it not uncommon to be left without a definitive diagnosis.\n\n【2】A 52-year-old man was referred for evaluation of a spell of impaired consciousness, resulting in a motor vehicle accident 3 days before presentation. On the morning of the accident, he was feeling well apart from mild low back pain, for which he took 2 acetaminophen tablets and 2 ibuprofen tablets at 7:30 AM . He recalls driving out of his neighborhood and having a vague sense of watching himself drive. His memory of the event is otherwise limited, although he recalls hitting a curb and sitting in the car with airbags deployed. Review of a phone call at the time of the accident with his wife confirmed appropriate answering of questions, without repetitive question asking or aphasia suggestive of transient global amnesia or ischemia. Neurologic examination was normal. He was admitted to the hospital for observation. Results of a urine drug screen (UDS) were negative on admission. During hospitalization, he was noted to fall asleep mid-sentence and report odd dreams. Twelve hours after the accident, he had returned to normal. Results of a computed tomography scan of his head and telemetry were unremarkable. He was discharged without recurrent episodes. Results of brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram were normal. Subsequently, the pills he thought to be ibuprofen were screened through Pillbox  by Google, searching “pillbox 6469”; selecting the identical image to the tablets he ingested proved to be zolpidem 10 mg immediate-release tablets . Accordingly, he had ingested zolpidem 20 mg immediately before the accident, which is twice the highest recommended adult hypnotic dosage. Admission UDS eventually returned positive for zolpidem 3 days after admission. A confirmatory serum zolpidem level added on to the patient’s admission blood work taken 8 hours after ingestion on the day of the accident was elevated at 3.19 ng/L. As such, our patient’s accident was consistent with zolpidem-induced amnesia.\n\n【3】Figure Photograph shows the pills (on the table) taken by the patient.

The incidence of degenerative thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) rupture was also delineated. We compared these results with other population-based studies of AAD, degenerative TAA, and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) rupture.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】删除21:<u>During a 15-year period, we identified 177 patients with thoracic aortic disease. We focused on 39 patients with AAD (22% of the entire cohort) and 28 with TAA rupture (16%). The annual age- and sex-adjusted incidences were 3.5 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval, 2.4–4.6) for AAD and 3.5 per 100,000 persons (95% confidence interval, 2.2–4.9) for TAA rupture. Thirty-three dissections (85%) involved the ascending aorta, whereas 6 (15%) involved only the descending aorta. Nineteen patients (49%) underwent 22 operations for AAD, with a 30-day case fatality rate of 9%. Among all 39 patients with AAD, median survival was only 3 days.

As such, we appreciate having the opportunity to clarify and expound upon our differing opinions.\n\n【1】Kyle and Stanford stated that “although environmental and behavioral factors may influence body fat percentage, it is neither a healthy lifestyle characteristic nor should it be considered as a health behavior.” We agree that body fat percentage is not a health behavior, but we respectfully disagree that body fat percentage cannot be considered a lifestyle characteristic. For this particular analysis, we viewed body fat percentage as an exposure and an important health characteristic rather than an outcome because body fat percentage is associated with morbidity and mortality.\n\n【2】Further, our approach is consistent with that in other studies\n\n【3】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【4】and that of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,\n\n【5】which similarly have reported the 4 healthy lifestyle characteristics to be physical activity, well-balanced diet, nonsmoking status, and normal body weight.\n\n【6】The authors also indicated that “body composition (bone, lean and fat mass) is largely an inherited characteristic” and that “body composition varies significantly by sex, age, race, and ethnicity, which may account for the differences ascertained in this study.” We acknowledge that body composition, and in particular body fat percentage, may be influenced by inherited characteristics, but we also note that there is consistent evidence that modifiable factors (eg, diet and physical activity) influence body fat percentage.\n\n【7】With regard to body composition varying by sex, age, and race/ethnicity, we completely agree and in fact documented this point in Table 1 of our article. Further, these demographic characteristics were adjusted for in our multivariate models.\n\n【8】Kyle and Stanford further stated that a flaw in our study was our “conclusion that a very low percentage of adults have the characteristics of a healthy lifestyle.” In the first paragraph of the “Results” section of our article, we reported the prevalence of participants who had all 4 healthy lifestyle characteristics, as well as the prevalence estimates for those with 0, 1, 2, and 3 healthy lifestyle characteristics. This approach allows the reader to identify the percentage of American adults who have individual and multiple positive health characteristics.\n\n【9】The authors expressed concern about including body fat percentage as a healthy lifestyle characteristic, noting that “many individuals with obesity can and do practice healthy lifestyle behaviors.” We completely agree, and that is why we evaluated the independent associations of body fat percentage with cardiovascular disease biomarkers, as well as the joint associations of body fat percentage and healthy behaviors with the cardiovascular disease biomarkers. These results are presented and discussed in our article.\n\n【10】Kyle and Stanford concluded that “the flaw in this article reflects a widely held and false bias that obesity is exclusively the result of lifestyle behaviors.” We disagree with their interpretation. In fact, our study did not evaluate a direct link between health behaviors and obesity. Rather, we evaluated the independent and combined associations of the 4 health characteristics with cardiovascular disease biomarkers.\n\n【11】Although we appreciate Mr Kyle and Dr Stanford's interest in our article, their letter is not an accurate interpretation of our work or the study's findings.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": []}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:34", "update_time": "2024-08-26 01:19:22", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:36:57"}

However, the association between HCC surveillance and early diagnosis of PC in patients with HBV- and HCV-related chronic liver disease is unknown. Therefore, the Ehime Pancreato-Cholangiology (EPOCH) Study Group designed this study to determine whether patients with HBV- and HCV-related chronic liver disease who were undergoing surveillance for HCC were diagnosed as having PC at an early stage.\n\n【33】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【34】In this retrospective study, we examined data from 520 consecutive patients diagnosed as having PC from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2013, at Ehime University Hospital and its affiliated centers (EPOCH Study Group). The diagnosis of PC was based on tumor markers, abdominal imaging, or histologic findings, as previously described.\n\n【35】EPOCH Study Group  \nImprovement of long-term outcomes in pancreatic cancer and its associated factors within the gemcitabine era: a collaborative retrospective multicenter clinical review of 1,082 patients.\n\n【36】The present study examined data regarding age, sex, likelihood of PC diagnosis, UICC stage (7th edition)\n\n【37】at PC diagnosis, and markers for viral hepatitis (hepatitis B surface antigen and antibodies to HCV). The staging of PC was generally based on the clinical stage, although the classification of stage 0 was determined pathologically. Based on the aim of the present study, patients without test results for viral hepatitis markers (n=73) were excluded.\n\n【38】The data are reported as mean ± SD or number and percentage. Intergroup comparisons were performed using the χ 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> test. Differences were considered statistically significant at 2-tailed _P_ <.05. All the statistical analyses were performed using JMP software (version 13; SAS Institute Inc). Data were stored in a secure database, and patients were numerically coded to anonymize their data. The study’s protocol complied with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine.\n\n【39】Results\n-------\n\n【40】### Patient Characteristics\n\n【41】The cohort included 447 patients with PC (240 men and 207 women; mean ± SD age, 72±10 years; age range, 33-91 years). Forty-five patients (10%) were positive for either hepatitis B surface antigen (n=18, 4%) or anti-HCV (n=27, 6%), although none of them had coinfection. Of these 45 patients, 26 had newly diagnosed HBV/HCV infections at PC diagnosis; of the other 19 patients, 16 were undergoing periodic HCC surveillance, based on HBV- or HCV-related chronic liver disease, at their PC diagnosis (the HCC surveillance group) .\n\n【42】Figure 1 Study flow chart. Of 520 patients with pancreatic cancer (PC), 447 were included, and the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance group included 16 patients with PC who were undergoing HCC surveillance. EPOCH = Ehime Pancreato-Cholangiology; HBV = hepatitis B virus; HCV = hepatitis C virus.\n\n【43】### Distribution of the UICC Stages at PC Diagnosis\n\n【44】The overall distribution of the UICC stages at PC diagnosis was stage 0 (n=6, 1.3%), stage IA (n=31, 6.9%), stage IB (n=29, 6.5%), stage IIA (n=88, 19.7%), stage IIB (n=49, 11.0%), stage III (n=58, 13.0%), and stage IV (n=186, 41.6%). In the HCC surveillance group (n=16), the distribution was stage 0 (n=2, 12.5%), stage IA (n=3, 18.8%), stage IB (n=2, 12.5%), stage IIA (n=2, 12.5%), stage IIB (n=2, 12.5%), stage III (n=1, 6.3%), and stage IV (n=4, 25%) . In the nonsurveillance group (n=431), the distribution was stage 0 (n=4, 0.9%), stage IA (n=28, 6.5%), stage IB (n=27, 6.3%), stage IIA (n=86, 20.0%), stage IIB (n=48, 11.1%), stage III (n=56, 13.0%), and stage IV (n=182, 42.2%) . A dilated pancreatic duct led to the diagnosis of PC in all 6 patients with pathology-proven stage 0 disease after resection.\n\n【45】Figure 2 Distribution of the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) stages at the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. HCC = hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n【46】### Comparing UICC Stages Between the HCC Surveillance and Nonsurveillance Groups\n\n【47】When we compared the very early stage (stage 0) and the remaining stages (stages IA-IV), we found that the HCC surveillance group had significantly more patients with very-early-stage disease (12.5% vs 0.9%; _P_ \\=.02). Similar results were observed when stages IA and IB were included as early stages (stages 0-IA vs stages IB-IV: _P_ \\=.007; stages 0-IB vs stages IIA-IV: _P_ \\=.004). However, no significant difference was observed when stage IIA was included as an early stage (stages 0-IIA vs stages IIB-IV; _P_ \\=.10).\n\n【48】### Sample Case\n\n【49】A male patient in his early 80s with HCV-related liver cirrhosis had a history of HCC. He was undergoing HCC surveillance every 3 months (combined ultrasonography, enhanced computed tomography \\[CT\\], and tumor markers), which provided no notable findings until enhanced abdominal CT revealed a dilated main pancreatic duct (diameter, 5 mm), which was associated with atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail . Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography  and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP)  confirmed the dilated pancreatic duct. Further investigation, which included analysis of pancreatic juice that had been retrieved during the ERP, supported a suspicion of Papanicolaou class V cytology . Thus, he underwent distal pancreatectomy , and the final pathologic diagnosis was pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia-3 (UICC stage 0)  and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia-2 .\n\n【50】Figure 3 Preoperative imaging findings from a patient with pancreatic cancer. The arterial phase of contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed a dilated main pancreatic duct, which was associated with atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail (A). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a stricture in the main pancreatic duct, with dilation of the peripheral duct (B). Similar findings regarding the main pancreatic duct were observed during endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, and pancreatic juice was collected (C), which supported a suspicion of Papanicolaou class V cytology (D).\n\n【51】Figure 4 Postoperative pathologic findings from a patient with pancreatic cancer. Mapping of the resected surgical specimen (A) revealed pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia-3 (PanIN3) (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification × 100) (B) along the main pancreatic duct (red dots) and PanIN2 (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification × 400) (C) in the parenchyma of the pancreas (yellow dots). The pathologic features of PanIN3 were high-grade atypia and papillary proliferation in the epithelium of the main pancreatic duct, loss of nuclear polarity, abnormal mitoses, and nuclear irregularities (B).\n\n【52】Discussion\n----------\n\n【53】The present study revealed 2 main findings. First, patients with HBV- and HCV-related chronic liver disease who were undergoing surveillance for HCC could be diagnosed as having PC at an early stage. Second, even patients who were undergoing HCC surveillance were frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage, with 25% of those patients having distant metastasis.\n\n【54】The first main finding is related to the fact that surveillance for HCC involves routine abdominal imaging, regardless of whether the patient has clear symptoms. Thus, it may be important to focus on both the liver and the pancreas during this imaging, with care taken to determine whether a dilated pancreatic duct or cystic lesions are present. Because 25% of the HCC surveillance group was diagnosed as having distant metastasis, even standard of care is carefully evaluating the pancreas on all abdominal imaging studies. Furthermore, although the EPOCH Study Group focuses on pancreatic and biliary diseases, some members are board-certified hepatologists who provide good knowledge of both PC and chronic liver disease. However, in the general clinical setting, it is important to improve our understanding of the indirect findings of PC because patients with suspected PC must be referred to specialists and undergo endoscopic ultrasonography and ERP, in addition to more general magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and contrast-enhanced CT.\n\n【55】Diagnostic strategies for early pancreatic cancer.\n\n【56】Therefore, radiologists, ultrasonographers, and nonspecialists should be educated regarding the indirect findings of PC because any form of imaging follow-up (eg, postoperative screening for malignant disease) may help facilitate the early diagnosis of PC. Thus, the diagnosis of PC tumors with a diameter less than 10 mm could help improve 5-year survival to greater than 80%.\n\n【57】Japan Pancreatic Cancer Registry; 30th year anniversary: Japan Pancreas Society.\n\n【58】There are several possible explanations for the second main finding. First, the pancreas, and especially the pancreatic tail, can occasionally be difficult to visualize during ultrasonography. Second, pancreatic duct dilation is limited to a short range when the neoplastic lesion exists in the pancreatic tail, despite the tail being visualized. It may be possible to address these issues using contrast-enhanced CT if the incidence of PC is as high as the annual incidence of HCC, which is approximately 5% in patients with HBV- and HCV-related chronic liver diseases.\n\n【59】A multivariate analysis of risk factors for hepatocellular carcinogenesis: a prospective observation of 795 patients with viral and alcoholic cirrhosis.\n\n【60】However, this strategy seems impractical given that these patients do not have a high risk of PC and the prevalence of PC is low.\n\n【61】JPHC Study Group  \nHepatitis B and C virus infection and risk of pancreatic cancer: a population-based cohort study (JPHC Study Cohort II).\n\n【62】Therefore, patients with HBV- and HCV-related chronic liver diseases should be managed according to the HCC surveillance guidelines.\n\n【63】The present study has several limitations. The first is the retrospective design, as we did not have access to data regarding the tumor location or exact timing of the last abdominal imaging. Second, the prevalence of HBV and HCV infection in the present study (10%) was higher than that in the general Japanese population (HBV: 0.9% and HCV: 1.64% among 70- to 74-year-old Japanese individuals).\n\n【64】Total numbers of undiagnosed carriers of hepatitis C and B viruses in Japan estimated by age- and area-specific prevalence on the national scale.\n\n【65】Third, we did not have final staging data for all the patients because the intraoperatively estimated surgical stage was used for patients who could not complete surgical resection because of liver metastasis or dissemination, and the pathologic stage was used for patients who completed surgical resection. However, many physicians select the initial management strategy based on the clinical stage. Fourth, one might argue about the small number of patients in the HCC surveillance group (n=16), especially those who were diagnosed at stage 0 (n=2). Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to note that even when early stage was expanded up to stage IB, which is still within the resectable stage without metastasis, the HCC surveillance group had significantly more patients with PC at an early stage. Fifth, we focused on the stage at diagnosis of PC in this study, thus, the long-term outcome of these patients is unclear. Finally, although this was not an observational study of continuous patients with HBV- and HCV-related chronic liver disease undergoing HCC surveillance, false-positive findings of pancreatic lesions during HCC surveillance may lead to unnecessary procedures being performed. However, to our knowledge, there is no study showing the impact of incidentally detected pancreatic lesions during HCC surveillance. Furthermore, patients with HBV- and HCV-related chronic liver disease do not have a high risk of PC, and the prevalence of PC is low. Despite these limitations, it is important to identify efficient surrogate markers for PC, which can facilitate its early diagnosis and treatment. Thus, the present findings may be useful in this context, especially when screening populations with elevated prevalence of HBV and HCV infection and patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or a history of colorectal cancer because they share risk factors with PC (eg, diabetes and obesity).\n\n【66】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【67】Patients with HBV- and HCV-related chronic liver disease who underwent surveillance for HCC were diagnosed as having PC at a relatively early stage. Therefore, careful observation of the pancreas and special attention to the indirect features of PC are important during HCC surveillance. However, it is unclear whether patients who are diagnosed as having early-stage PC during HCC surveillance experience improved long-term outcomes because they may have advanced liver disease, which could alter the approach to managing PC. Nevertheless, the present findings indicate that even retrospective review of imaging findings may be useful for identifying features of PC (eg, a dilated pancreatic duct or cystic lesions), which could facilitate the diagnosis of early-stage PC before a masslike lesion can be detected. Further studies are needed to address these issues.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:29:59", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:30:38", "cost": 39.053}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:34", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:30:38", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:29:58"}

The association between the MELD and MELD-XI scoring systems and risk of postoperative outcomes was assessed in regression models adjusting for relevant covariates. The primary outcome was operative mortality (death within 90 days or in hospital). Secondary outcomes included various measures of postoperative morbidity.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A total of 175 and 226 patients had data for MELD/MELD-XI, respectively. Ninety-day mortality was 8.7%. When stratified into tertiles of MELD-XI, the unadjusted risk of 90-day mortality was 2.7%, 8.2%, and 16.0%, respectively. In Cox regression models fitted for MELD-XI and MELD, higher scores associated with increased risk of mortality ( _P_ <.001 for both). In secondary multivariable analyses, both MELD-XI and MELD were associated with increased incidence of renal failure and greater levels of chest-tube output and transfusion, whereas MELD-XI was additionally associated with prolonged intubation and extended intensive care unit and hospital stays.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Among patients undergoing pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis, MELD-XI and MELD were associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality. Although the simpler MELD-XI score generally performed as well or better than MELD as a correlate of various outcomes, both scores can serve as a simple yet robust risk stratification tool for patients undergoing pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CVP ( central venous pressure ), EuroSCORE ( European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation ), INR ( International Normalized Ratio ), LOS ( length of stay ), LVAD ( left-ventricular assist device ), MELD ( model for end-stage liver disease ), MELD-XI ( model for end-stage liver disease excluding international normalized ratio )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 09:48:53", "endTime": "2024/08/27 09:49:59", "cost": 66.11}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:34", "update_time": "2024-08-26 17:49:58", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 17:48:51"}

Bacilli cultured from 11 of these biopsies were gram negative, flagellate and microaerophilic, and appeared to be a new species related to the genus _Campylobacter._ They stated that these bacteria were present in almost all patients with active, chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer, or gastric ulcer and that they might be an important factor in the etiology of these diseases. Treatment of these patients with antibiotics resulted in disappearance of the bacteria and healing of the ulcer. They also reported that eradication of the bacteria markedly reduced the relapse rate of duodenal ulcer.\n\n【7】The medical community finally recognized the role of _Helicobacter_ (as the bacteria was renamed in 1989) after Marshall self-experimented by drinking a culture of the “curved” bacilli in 1984. This resulted in nausea, vomiting, and achlorydria. A gastric biopsy revealed severe gastritis and the presence of the organism. He then took antibiotics and recovered.\n\n【8】删除21:<u>Warren also helped in the development of the 删除19:<u><sup>14 </sup></u> C-urea breath-test for detecting _H. pylori_ in peptic ulcer patients in 1989.</u>\n\n【9】删除21:<u>Warren and Marshall were subsequently invited to speak at many medical meetings throughout the world.

The underlying pathogenic substrate of all these entities is the unstable coronary plaque with an overlying intracoronary thrombus. Initial management for the patient with suspected UA includes a resting electrocardiogram and oral administration of aspirin. ST-segment elevation indicates acute MI with the need for urgent reperfusion therapy. Patients without ST-segment elevation commonly have a mixture of VA and non-ST elevation MI; initial management is similar with assessment of near-term risk of MI or death as the next step. Features of UA indicating high risk include persistent ST-segment depression, persistent ischemic pain, elevated troponin level, or features of heart failure. Such patients undergo intensive medical therapy with heparin (unfractionated or low-molecular-weight), β-blockade, and IIb/IIa antiplatelet agents, usually followed by coronary angiography and percutaneous intervention. The timing of intervention depends on the patient's response to therapy. Intermediate- or low-risk patients (including those presenting to the emergency department) can be managed with a chest pain unit strategy, and those with normal results on serial electrocardiograms, cardiac marker studies, and functional testing can be safely discharged home. Others are admitted for elective angiography, intensive medical therapy, or both. Assessment of coronary risk factors and their modification is an important component of long-term therapy for both high-risk and low-risk patients with UA, as well as those determined to have had non-S I'elevation MI.\n\n【1】ACS ( acute coronary syndromes ), ECG ( electrocardiogram ), LV ( left ventricular ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), NSTMI ( non-ST elevation MI ), PCI ( percutaneous coronary intervention ), UA ( unstable angina )\n\n【2】Unstable angina (UA) is one of a group of entities referred to as acute coronary syndromes (ACS) comprising UA, non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTMI), and ST elevation MI. At presentation, UA and NSTMI are commonly indistinguishable and are therefore approached similarly. The pathogenic substrate of UA and NSTMI is usually an incompletely occluding intracoronary thrombus, superimposed on a complex atherosclerotic plaque. The unpredictable clinical manifestations of prolonged or rest angina are likely due to intermittent vessel occlusion from coexistent thrombosis and dethrombosis of the platelet-rich clot, secondary vasospasm, and distal platelet emboli. If untreated, UA progresses to death in 5% to 10% of patients and to nonfatal MI in 10% to 20%; most of these events occur within days to weeks after symptom onset.\n\n【3】While treatment is urgent, detection of the syndrome is sometimes complicated by atypical symptoms and lack of specific electrocardiographic (ECG) and laboratory findings, resulting in unnecessary hospitalization of some patients and inadvertent discharge of others. Our current understanding of the diagnosis and management of UA-NSTMI is best presented in an algorithm format and, as such, may serve as a generic “critical pathway” approach to this topic.\n\n【4】An algorithm for the management of the patient with suspected ACS is shown in Figure 1 . An ECG has a critical role, by first identifying patients with ST elevation MI in whom urgent reperfusion therapy is indicated. For all other patients, a directed cardiovascular history and examination begin the risk stratification process. Aspirin is often administered at this point unless dissection is suspected.\n\n【5】Fig. 1 Algorithm demonstrating the management of patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes. ECG = electrocardiogram; LMWH = low-molecular-weight heparin; MI = myocardial infarction; UFH= unfractionated heparin.\\* = Basedon Braunwald classification? or guidelines from the Agencyfor Health Care Policyand Research.\n\n【6】† = Most low-risk patient scan be managed without patient evaluation and primary prevention.\n\n【7】High-Risk Classification\n------------------------\n\n【8】Although the change in the frequency of both exertional angina and prolonged rest pain is considered under the “umbrella” of UA, the latter is far more likely to evolve to MI or death. Validated clinical instruments such as the Braunwald classification\n\n【9】or the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Unstable Angina Management Guidelines\n\n【10】use ECG and clinical variables to predict the near-term risk of MI or death based on individual patient characteristics; generally accepted high- and low-risk criteria have been formulated.\n\n【11】High-risk features include fixed or dynamic ST-segment depression on the resting ECG, persistent or recurrent ischemic pain, elevation of serum cardiac markers such as creatine kinase-MB or troponins, and substantial left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, including a clinical manifestation such as congestive heart failure or shock. Patients without these features who have only recent change in angina provocation or frequency or those with a clinically noncardiac (ie, pleurisy, chest wall tenderness) source may be considered at low to intermediate risk.\n\n【12】### Special Situations\n\n【13】**_Aspirin allergy_** —lopidogrel, 75 mg/d, may be substituted; thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has been noted in 11 cases (about 3 million individuals have received this drug; thus, the incidence is very low)\n\n【14】**_Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia_** —typically, this does not occur during the first 5 days of therapy unless recent prior exposure to heparin has occurred. Patients with this disorder often have an antibody to the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex. Substitute hirudin, a direct-acting antithrombin that is structurally and functionally unrelated to heparin\n\n【15】**_β-Blockers_** —contraindicated in second degree or greater atrioventricular block and in patients with severe asthma, but they should not be withheld in diabetic patients\n\n【16】**_Calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil)_** —indicated for rate control of rapid atrial fibrillation, which may accompany or precipitate ACS in some patients. However, there is no primary indication for these agents in ACS otherwise, and they should generally be avoided unless needed for angina control in addition to β-blocker\n\n【17】**_Refractory ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation_** —the drug of choice is now intravenous amiodarone, 150-mg bolus and intravenous infusion\n\n【18】**_Mechanical complications of ischemia or infarction_** — with extensive infarction, pump failure is the most serious and is a strong indication for reperfusion therapy as well as for inotropic support and intra-aortic balloon pumping. With inferior wall Ml, complications such as papillary muscle dysfunction or rupture and hemodynamically severe right ventricular infarction are more common. Surface or transesophageal echocardiography allows rapid and accurate differentiation of these etiologies\n\n【19】**_Sudden hemodynamic collapse_** —because preexisting symptoms of ACS may be vague in some patients (elderly, females, postoperative), the differential diagnosis is wide and also includes pulmonary embolus, dissection, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, and sepsis\n\n【20】### Common Drug Doses\n\n【21】**_Aspirin_** —180–325 mg chewed and subsequently taken daily\n\n【22】**_Unfractionated heparin_** —5000 U bolus, 1000 U/h drip or weight-based nomogram; target activated partial thromboplastin time, 50 to 70 seconds\n\n【23】**_Low-molecular-weight heparin_** —enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg twice a day subcutaneously\n\n【24】**_β-Blockers_**\n\n【25】Atenolol—intravenously, 5 mg over 5 minutes up to 3 doses; orally, 25 to 100 mg/d\n\n【26】Esmolol—500 μg/kg bolus and infusion of 10 to 200 μg/kg per minute\n\n【27】Metoprolol—intravenously, 5 mg over 5 minutes up to 3 doses; orally, 25 to 100 mg twice a day\n\n【28】**_Abciximab_** —0.25 mg/kg bolus and 0.125 ug/kg infusion (maximum, 10 μg/min) for 12 hours\n\n【29】**_Tirojiban_** —0.4 μg/kg per minute for 30 minutes, then 0.1 ug/kg per minute for 72 to 108 hours for ACS or 12 to 24 hours after PCl; reduced dose for renal insufficiency\n\n【30】**_Eptifibatide_** —180 μg/kg bolus, repeat in 10 minutes; 2 μg/kg per minute (reduce dose for renal insufficiency) 20 to 24 hours after PCl\n\n【31】The cardiac troponins are contractile proteins released with myocardial injury. Their presence in plasma, even at low levels, is highly sensitive and specific for injury; moreover, there is a direct relationship between level of elevation and subsequent mortality.\n\n【32】The prognostic value of troponin T in unstable angina.\n\n【33】Troponin elevation in patients otherwise considered to have _UA_ is likely due to microinfarction as a result of transient total vessel occlusion or platelet embolic showers, and it identifies a subset of patients who will benefit from more potent.intravenous platelet inhibitors. Troponin elevation reaches maximal sensitivity for myocardial damage at 6 to 8 hours after symptom onset; a normal value at this point demonstrates a highly negative predictive value (“rule out”). A low-level elevation creatine kinase-MB while less sensitive and specific than troponin, has similar prognostic importance.\n\n【34】Intensive Medical Therapy\n-------------------------\n\n【35】Intensive medical therapy in a monitored setting is indicated for high-risk patients. Aspirin and intravenous unfractionated heparin provide synergistic antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects and are of proven efficacy. β-Blockade is indicated with a target heart rate of 50 to 60 beats/min; LV dysfunction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes should not be considered absolute contraindications. A short-acting agent, such as esmolol, can be used, with rapid cessation if adverse effects occur. Intravenous nitroglycerin is useful for angina relief, although tolerance can develop within 24 hours.\n\n【36】### Low-Molecular-Weight Heparins\n\n【37】Low-molecular-weight heparins are produced by shortening the heterogeneous unfractionated heparin molecules, and they exert more inhibitory effect on factor Xa than on thrombin. Advantages include better bioavailability, more predictable effect, twice daily subcutaneous administration, and lack of need to monitor effect and adjust dose.\n\n【38】Of the available agents, only enoxaparin\n\n【39】Assessment of the treatment effect of enoxaparin for unstable angina/non-Q-wave myocardiat infarction: TIMI 1 1B-ESSENCE meta-analysis.\n\n【40】has shown a statistically significant reduction in MI or death compared with unfractionated heparin in patients with _UA_ (20% relative and 1.4% absolute decrease of MI or death at day 2; 3.2% absolute decrease at day 43). Either regular (unfractionated) heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is acceptable for use in ACS; low-molecular-weight heparin will likely be the agent of choice in the future.\n\n【41】### Glycoprotein Iib/Iiia Platelet Inhibitors\n\n【42】Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa platelet inhibitors act by competitive inhibition of the receptor providing the final common pathway of platelet aggregation. In a meta-analysis\n\n【43】Clinical outcomes of therapeutic agents that block the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa integrin in ischemic heart disease.\n\n【44】of more than 32,000 patients, many of whom had ACS, an odds ratio of 0.88 was observed for the end point of death or MI, with 13 fewer events per 1000 patients treated compared with controls. These agents are most effective in high-risk patients (those with elevated cardiac serum markers) and when administered before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The indications for use of these agents are expanding, and there is strong consensus that candidates include those with symptoms refractory to conventional intensive medical therapy (aspirin, heparin, β-blockers, nitrates), persistent ST-segment depression, or elevated serum markers as well as those with planned high-risk coronary intervention, ie, most high-risk patients with UA. Currently available agents include the chimeric antibody abciximab (ReoPro) and the nonantibody small molecule agents tirofiban (Aggrastat) and eptifibatide (Integrilin). Careful management of heparin anticoagulation is paramount to reduce bleeding risks; the currently available agents are contraindicated in patients with thrombocytopenia or bleeding diathesis. Use of these agents may rarely cause severe thrombocytopenia (<20,000 platelets/mm 删除19:<u><sup>3 </sup></u> in <1% of patients). The infusion must be discontinued, and platelet transfusion must be given.\n\n【45】Pharmacologic agents not currently recommended in most patients with UA-NSTMI include calcium channel blockers (especially dihydropyridines without concomitant β-blockade), hirudin (except for patients with a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia), fibrinolytics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (unless there is systolic LV dysfunction), and warfarin.\n\n【46】Intermediate- And Low-Risk Classifications\n------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Based on a clinical risk algorithm, patients in the intermediateto low-risk classification have an expected risk of MI or death of approximately 6% or 1 %, respectively. An emergency department-based chest pain unit has demonstrated utility in defining which of these patients are at sufficiently low risk to be discharged home. The remaining patients are admitted to a monitored area for observation. A 6-hour monitoring period, including serial ECGs and cardiac markers, is followed, if results are normal, by stress testing. In patients with ECG findings unsuitable for treadmill testing, stress imaging with an isotope or echocardiogram is selectively used. Patients in whom all results are normal are discharged home. With this strategy, most lowrisk and almost one half of intermediate-risk patients can safely avoid hospitalization.\n\n【48】Chest Pain Evaluation in the Emergency Room (CHEER) Investigators. A clinical trial of a chest-pain observation unit for patients with unstable angina.\n\n【49】Follow-up with a primary physician or cardiologist is desirable in those with unexplained or recurrent symptoms.\n\n【50】Coronary Angiography\n--------------------\n\n【51】Most patients with high-risk features and those whose test results in the chest pain unit are abnormal undergo definition of coronary anatomy. While some of these patients could conceivably be managed with intensive prolonged medical therapy, angiography is a safe and expedient method to identify the 20% of patients with normal coronaries and the 15% to 30% with left main or multivessel disease who may require surgery. In the rest of the patients, knowledge of lesion severity and distribution allows selection of candidates for PCl, surgery, or medical therapy.\n\n【52】Early Invasive Vs Conservative Approach\n---------------------------------------\n\n【53】Proponents of the early invasive approach advocate the aforementioned benefits of angiography and downplay “reperfusion momentum,” which may lead to excessive PCI of clinically important but stabilized stenoses. Proponents of the conservative approach cite the early effectiveness of initial medical therapy and the fact that once the lesion passivation (the stabilization or regression of the thrombus overlying the ruptured plaque) is achieved, there is a low likelihood of recurrent clinical events. Four trials (TIMI IIIB \\[Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction\\],\n\n【54】VANQWISH \\[Veterans Affairs Non-Q- Wave Infarction Strategies in Hospital\\],\n\n【55】Veterans Affairs Non-Q-Wave Infarction Strategies in Hospital (VANQWISH) Trial Investigators.\n\n【56】OASIS \\[Organisation to Assess Strategies for Ischemic syndromes\\],\n\n【57】OASIS (Organisation to Assess Strategies for lschaemic Syndromes) Registry Investigators. Variations between countries in invasive cardiac procedures and outcomes in patients with suspected unstable angina or myocardial infarction without initial ST elevation.\n\n【58】and FRISC II \\[FRagmin and Fast Revascularisation during InStability in Coronary artery disease\\]\n\n【59】examined these initial management approaches; results of 3 were inconclusive in part because of crossover between groups, lack of randomization, various admixture of UA and NSTMI, and a minority of patients in the “invasive” assigned group actually received revascularization. The recent FRISC II trial\n\n【60】” utilized a 2 by 2 factorial randomization of 2457 patients to dalteparin (Fragmin), a low-molecular-weight heparin, or unfractionated heparin and to early invasive or conservative strategies. Only a trend toward benefit from the lowmolecular-weight heparin was found, but those randomized to an invasive strategy had a 22% relative and 2.7% absolute reduction in nonfatal MI or death compared with the noninvasive group at 6 months (12.1% vs 9.4%). The trial incorporated stents and the GP IIb/IIIb platelet inhibitors, surgical mortality was low (reflecting contemporary practice), and there was low crossover (9% at 10 days). The median duration between hospitalization and intervention was 4 days; however, mortality was higher in the invasive group within the first 2 weeks (early hazard). There was no benefit observed in females (MI or death—invasive, _10.5%;_ conservative, 8.3%), age 65 years or younger (invasive, 8.1% conservative, 8.1 _%_ or those without ST depression at presentation (invasive, _8.4%;_ conservative, 8.9%). The greatest benefit was seen in diabetic patients (invasive, 18.3%; conservative, 24.5%), age 65 years or older (invasive, _10.5%;_ conservative, 15.8%), in men (invasive, _8.9%;_ conservative, 13.9%), and those with ST depression (invasive, _10.3%;_ conservative, _15.5%)._ Thus, the higher-risk patient achieved the most benefit from early revascularization in this trial, an observation that can be generalized to management of ACS in practice. In fact, the early invasive and noninvasive strategies are complementary rather than isolated, and individual treatment decisions must be made based on patient risk and the safety and efficacy of revascularization procedures at the specific medical center. In our practice, most high-risk patients with UA and most patients with non-Q-wave MI undergo 24 hours of medical stabilization, followed by elective angiography and PCI if clinically important lesions are seen. Medically refractory patients undergo urgent procedures. Patients with severe multivessel disease and diabetes undergo bypass surgery.\n\n【61】Primary And Secondary Prevention\n--------------------------------\n\n【62】Cessation of cigarette smoking; control of hypertension, weight, and hyperglycemia; and regular exercise are part of all preventive practices. Perhaps the most important “medical intervention” is lowering the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin). A low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 100 mg/dL is desirable in all patients with established coronary artery disease; the resultant reduction in coronary events is in excess of that expected for the amount of cholesterol lowering, perhaps because of anti-inflammatory and other plaque-stabilizing effects of this class of agents. In our practice, many patients with ACS are referred to our Cardiovascular Health Clinic for consultation and an exercise program before being discharged home.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:35:54", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:37:01", "cost": 67.619}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:34", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:37:01", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:35:53"}

July 2017 saw the transition of editorial leadership at the _Proceedings_ —I am doubly privileged not only by currently serving in this role but also by assuming it from William L. (Bill) Lanier, MD. Dr Lanier superbly led the _Proceedings_ for 18 years, during which time the _Proceedings_ established itself as the third largest indexed medical journal in the world; published seminal contributions that are highly cited; established a global reach and readership and a global provenance of submitting authors; successfully created in 2017 an online expansion journal ; and has now attained an impact factor of 6.686, as reported in the summer of 2017. Such a record of achievement by Dr Lanier and his team places the _Proceedings_ on a bedrock on which the stature of the _Proceedings_ can be further enhanced and provides a vantage point from which new features and initiatives in the _Proceedings_ can be envisioned and introduced.\n\n【1】Two new sections are now in place, with each section led by a dedicated editor. The Women's Health section features original articles, thematic reviews, commentaries, and editorials on salient aspects of this vital field. The _Proceedings_ is fortunate that this new Women's Health section is led by Vesna Garovic, MD, PhD, a nationally recognized expert in this field, especially as it relates to hypertensive, cardiovascular, and kidney diseases in women in general and the association of such diseases with disorders of pregnancy in particular. Dr Garovic currently serves as Chair of Research, Division of Nephrology and Hypertension and as Director, Office of Clinical Trials, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic. Also introduced is a new section devoted to guidelines, meta-analyses, and new methodologies. The _Proceedings_ is again fortunate in that this section is led by M. Hassan Murad, MD, MPH, a nationally recognized expert in evidence synthesis (systematic reviews, meta-analysis, network meta-analysis, meta-regression, and meta-narrative synthesis), methodologic research, and clinical practice guideline development. Dr Murad currently leads the Mayo Clinic Evidence-Based Practice Research Program and is a member of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development and Evaluation Working Group.\n\n【2】Two new types of peer-reviewed articles will be introduced this year, “Understanding Disease” and “Perspectives and Controversies.” Authors of such articles are either invited by the _Proceedings_ to provide such a contribution or may contact the _Proceedings_ if they wish to submit such a contribution for consideration for publication in the _Proceedings_ . “Understanding Disease” addresses an issue commonly experienced by generalists, specialists, and subspecialists—namely, a sense of incomplete and/or out-of-date knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of common diseases treated by other practitioners.

Also compared were B cells obtained from peripheral blood samples from 5 healthy controls and B cells from reactive lymph nodes from 3 otherwise healthy persons. The patients were treated at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, between January 15, 1991, and February 7, 2003. Mononuclear cells were stained by a 2-color (fluorescein isothiocyanate/phycoerythrin) flow cytometric assay using antibodies to the chemokine receptors (CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR5, CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, and CCR7) and also to CD19.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Of the 45 patients in this study, 20 had Rai stage 0 disease, 12 had stage I disease, 3 had stage II disease, 2 had stage III disease, and 8 had stage IV disease. The mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the chemokine receptor expression on B-CLL cells was compared with normal controls and was not significantly different, except for an increase in the median expression of CXCR3 ( _P_ \\=.003) and CCR7 ( _P_ \\=.001) on B-CLL cells. We also found a significant increase in the expression of CXCR4 and CCR7 in B-CLL cells from patients with stage IV compared with stage 0 disease ( _P_ \\=.001 and _P_ \\=.02, respectively). Furthermore, circulating B-CLL cells showed significantly higher expression of CXCR4 and CCR7 when compared with B lymphocytes in lymph nodes ( _P_ \\=.003 and _P_ <.001, respectively).\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】The expression of CXCR4 and CCR7 on B-CLL cells correlates with Rai stage. Also, these chemokine receptors may be down-regulated once malignant B cells enter the lymph nodes. To our knowledge, this is the first published report that shows the strong association of Rai stage with CXCR4 and CCR7 expression levels in B-CLL cells.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】B-CLL ( B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ), FITC ( fluorescein isothiocyanate ), IFN ( interferon ), Ig VH ( immunoglobulin variable region of the heavy chain ), MFI ( mean fluorescent intensity ), PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ), PE ( phycoerythrin ), SDF-1 ( stromal cell-derived factor 1 ), WBC ( white blood cell )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:32:35", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:32:51", "cost": 15.488}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:34", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:32:51", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:32:35"}

All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography within 24 hours of admission to the intensive care unit. Myocardial dysfunction was classified as left ventricular (LV) diastolic, LV systolic, and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. Frequency of myocardial dysfunction was calculated, and demographic, hemodynamic, and physiologic variables and mortality were compared between the myocardial dysfunction types and patients without cardiac dysfunction.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The frequency of myocardial dysfunction in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock was 64% (n=68). Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction was present in 39 patients (37%), LV systolic dysfunction in 29 (27%), and RV dysfunction in 33 (31%). There was significant overlap. The 30-day and 1-year mortality rates were 36% and 57%, respectively. There was no difference in mortality between patients with normal myocardial function and those with left, right, or any ventricular dysfunction.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Myocardial dysfunction is frequent in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock and has a wide spectrum including LV diastolic, LV systolic, and RV dysfunction types.

In addition to risks of microvascular disease, patients with type 2 DM often have multiple risk factors of macrovascular disease; for example, approximately 90% of patients with type 2 DM are overweight/obese. Type 2 DM is a complex disease that involves a variety of pathophysiologic abnormalities, including insulin resistance, increased hepatic glucose production, and abnormalities in the secretion of hormones, such as insulin, glucagon, amylin, and incretins. Incretins are gut-derived peptides with a variety of glucoregulatory functions. Incretin dysfunction can be treated with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (eg, exenatide and liraglutide) or inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) (eg, sitagliptin and saxagliptin), the enzyme that degrades GLP-1. The GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors both elevate GLP-1 activity and substantially improve glycemic control. The GLP-1 receptor agonists are more effective in lowering blood glucose and result in substantial weight loss, whereas therapy with DPP-4 inhibitors lowers blood glucose levels to a lesser degree, and they are weight neutral.

Under normal circumstances, the reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus is prevented by a complex barrier at the esophagogastric junction. Dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter and the presence of a hiatal hernia lead to failure of this barrier. Esophageal mucosal damage results from the chronic exposure of the esophageal mucosa to gastroduodenal contents and the lack of an effective mucosal defense.

These high-risk manifestations of coronary atherosclerosis are important causes of the use of emergency medical care and hospitalization in the United States. A quick but thorough assessment of the patient's history and findings on physical examination, electrocardiography, radiologic studies, and cardiac biomarker tests permit accurate diagnosis and aid in early risk stratification, which is essential for guiding treatment. High-risk patients with UA/NSTEMI are often treated with an early invasive strategy involving cardiac catheterization and prompt revascularization of viable myocardium at risk. Clinical outcomes can be optimized by revascularization coupled with aggressive medical therapy that includes anti-ischemic, antiplatelet, anticoagulant, and lipid-lowering drugs. Evidence-based guidelines provide recommendations for the management of ACS; however, therapeutic approaches to the management of ACS continue to evolve at a rapid pace driven by a multitude of large-scale randomized controlled trials. Thus, clinicians are frequently faced with the problem of determining which drug or therapeutic strategy will achieve the best results.

The biochemical parameters and appearance of the fluid assessed during diagnostic evaluation were analyzed.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The study consisted of 37 men (50%) and 37 women (50%), with a median age of 61.5 years (range, 20-93 years). Chylothorax was caused by surgical procedures in 51%. The chylous pleural fluid appeared milky in only 44%. Pleural effusion was exudative in 64 patients (86%) and transudative in 10 patients (14%). However, pleural fluid protein and lactate dehydrogenase levels varied widely. Transudative chylothorax was present in all 4 patients with cirrhosis but was also seen with other causes.

Hospital mortality, the primary outcome, was examined in nondiabetic and diabetic ICU patients receiving insulin and in patients not requiring insulin (control group).\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of 7285 patients, 2826 (39%) required insulin, 1083 of whom (15% of total) had a history of diabetes mellitus. The control group had a median (10th-90th percentile) glucose level of 118 mg/dL (range, 97–153 mg/dL) and a 5% mortality rate. The median glucose level was 134 mg/dL (range, 110–181 mg/dL) in nondiabetic patients and 170 mg/dL (121–238 mg/dL) in diabetic patients ( _P_ <.001), whereas mortality rates were 10% and 6%, respectively ( _P<_ .001).

Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune condition with widespread organ involvement including coronary and noncoronary cardiac manifestations.\n\n【15】Chest pain and troponin T elevation raise concern for ACS, particularly with ST changes on ECG. However, ACS alone would not explain the presenting features of hypoxemia, diffuse lung opacities, and scant hemoptysis in the setting of normal TTE findings. It is possible that the patient has concurrent non–ST elevation myocardial infarction or type 2 demand ischemia from worsening anemia and hemodynamic instability. This diagnosis should be further evaluated by trending troponin and possible coronary angiography following hemodynamic stabilization. Chest pain and “troponinemia” can also be seen in myocarditis, although more diffuse ST elevation on ECG and abnormalities on echocardiography would be expected. The presence of acute anemia, hemoptysis, and diffuse lung opacities is more suggestive of a primary pulmonary process. Antiphospholipid syndrome, a prothrombotic condition affecting both venous and arterial vessels, can increase the risk for pulmonary embolism and DAH.\n\n【16】The absence of the Westermark sign on CXR and the lack of right ventricular strain on TTE in combination with the supratherapeutic INR level make pulmonary embolism unlikely. Severe pneumonia complicated by sepsis could account for the hypotension, hypoxia, and scant hemoptysis; however, leukocytosis and fever would be anticipated. It is reasonable, however, to administer antibiotics empirically for pneumonia. In the setting of a known chronic autoimmune condition, anemia, hemoptysis, and diffuse patchy opacities on CXR, the suspicion for DAH causing pleuritic chest pain is high and should be further evaluated.\n\n【17】Clinical characteristics of patients with acute pulmonary embolism: data from PIOPED II.\n\n【18】High-resolution noncontrast chest computed tomography revealed diffuse ground-glass opacities.

The criterion standard for diagnosing DAH is flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy with sequential BAL.\n\n【32】Sequential BAL is performed by instilling and retrieving 3 aliquots of 50- to 60-mL sterile nonbacteriostatic saline from a subsegmental bronchus. Alveolar hemorrhage is confirmed when lavage aliquots become progressively more hemorrhagic, a finding that differentiates DAH from other causes of hemoptysis. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages found in BAL fluid, which are visualized by Prussian blue staining, can also be used to diagnose DAH, especially when more than 20% of 200 macrophages stain positive.\n\n【33】This finding is especially helpful in diagnosing DAH in the absence of frank hemoptysis or a grossly hemorrhagic BAL. Transesophageal echocardiography provides superior detail compared with TTE for heart valves and the atrial septa but has a limited role in evaluating hemoptysis. Coronary angiography and cardiac MRI would rule out the presence of coronary obstruction and myopericardial inflammation, respectively, but would not be helpful in confirming DAH.\n\n【34】Fiberoptic bronchoscopy with sequential BAL produced progressively bloody return with 30% hemosiderin-laden macrophages, supporting the diagnosis of DAH.\n\n【35】*   **3.**\n\n【36】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most appropriate_ next step in the management of this patient's hemoptysis?**\n\n【37】    *   a.\n\n【38】        Discontinue heparin\n\n【39】    *   b.\n\n【40】        Discontinue heparin and administer protamine sulfate\n\n【41】    *   c.\n\n【42】        Discontinue heparin, administer protamine sulfate, and transfuse fresh frozen plasma\n\n【43】    *   d.\n\n【44】        Interventional radiology–guided catheter embolization\n\n【45】    *   e.\n\n【46】        Trial of pulse-dose methylprednisolone\n\n【47】The presence of deep venous thrombosis in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation is more suggestive of an underlying vascular microthrombotic event and capillaritis underlying the bleeding diathesis. Discontinuing antithrombotic agents such as heparin or reversing anticoagulation using protamine sulfate or fresh frozen plasma are not indicated because that would increase the risk for further thrombotic events and conversion to a catastrophic antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which has a high mortality rate. Pulmonary coil embolization has been used to treat arteriovenous malformations but has no role in management of DAH because most of the bleeding is mediated by a microthrombotic process and is often localized to the level of the alveolar septae and pulmonary capillaries, which are not amenable to such a procedure. Most diseases causing capillaritis are treated with a combination of systemic glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive therapy, such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Often, pulse-dose glucocorticoids are initiated while awaiting the results of testing to confirm a specific cause of capillaritis, which will then guide selection of additional immunosuppressive therapy. Most experts recommend administering intravenous pulse methylprednisolone (500-1000 mg in divided doses daily) for up to 5 days followed by transition to high-dose oral glucocorticoids with a gradual taper and initiation of a corticosteroid-sparing agent for maintenance therapy. In addition to corticosteroids, anticoagulation should also be continued when possible. The preferred anticoagulation in this setting is unfractionated heparin because it can be reversed quickly if necessary.\n\n【48】Heparin infusion was continued, and pulse-dose glucocorticoids were initiated with 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone daily. Despite radiographic resolution of DAH within 24 hours and symptomatic improvement in oxygenation, the troponin T level remained elevated (1.3 ng/mL) and chest pain recurred. Repeated troponin T measurements at 3 and 6 hours were 1.5 ng/mL and 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. Electrocardiography documented normal sinus rhythm with persistent ST depressions in the anterolateral leads. A second TTE disclosed a 15% decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction and development of regional wall motion abnormalities, more pronounced in the anterior and apical regions. In the interim, moderate mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitations had also developed.\n\n【49】*   **4.**\n\n【50】    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ cause of this patient's recurrent chest pain?**\n\n【51】    *   a.\n\n【52】        Myocarditis\n\n【53】    *   b.\n\n【54】        Endocarditis\n\n【55】    *   c.\n\n【56】        Pericarditis\n\n【57】    *   d.\n\n【58】        Coronary arteritis\n\n【59】    *   e.\n\n【60】        ACS\n\n【61】Myocarditis, endocarditis, and pericarditis are common cardiac manifestations of SLE, with a reported prevalence of 3% to 15%, 32% to 38%, and 11% to 54%, respectively.\n\n【62】Myocarditis is often characterized by the presence of diffuse T-wave inversion or saddle-shaped ST-segment elevation on ECG, which is not present in this case. Cardiac MRI can be used to help diagnose myocarditis, but tissue biopsy is considered the diagnostic standard. Endocarditis often presents with new mitral regurgitation or nonbacterial valvular vegetations manifesting as valvular dysfunction or embolic phenomenon. Systemic lupus erythematosus–associated pericarditis often manifests as diffuse ST-segment elevation on ECG and as pericardial rubs on cardiac auscultation.

In the setting of SLE and APS, the management of left main or multivessel disease is complex. Limited studies have found high intraoperative mortality (89%) and postoperative complications (84.2%) associated with cardiac surgery in patients with APS.\n\n【83】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【84】Cardiovascular surgical outcomes in patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome—a case-series.\n\n【85】Because of the high rate of morbidity and mortality associated with intracardiac surgery, complex percutaneous coronary intervention is reasonable in such cases. However, there is a higher risk for repeated target vessel revascularization after 6 months in patients who have APS compared with patients who have ST-elevation myocardial infarctions without APS.\n\n【86】Long-term outcome of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention.\n\n【87】At the present time, our patient would not meet criteria for either left ventricular assist device or cardiac transplant. Medical management, although reasonable in patients with multiple comorbidities, would be difficult in this situation in which the guideline-driven use of medications would be limited by the patient's tenuous hemodynamics.\n\n【88】The patient underwent complex angioplasty with placement of 5 drug-eluting stents in the affected coronary lesions, which led to hemodynamic stability and immediate resolution of her chest pain. She was discharged from the hospital 72 hours later in good condition with a treatment regimen of warfarin and clopidogrel.\n\n【89】Discussion\n----------\n\n【90】Chest pain is a common clinical presentation in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. The differential diagnosis for patients presenting with chest pain is broad, ranging from benign disorders such as musculoskeletal chest pain to life-threatening myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism. In patients with autoimmune disease, such as SLE or APS, the cause of chest pain can be difficult to ascertain because of atypical clinical presentation, antibody-mediated laboratory abnormalities, and physician unfamiliarity with this population. In general, chest pain in patients with underlying autoimmune conditions requires a thorough work-up because of the increased risk of life-threatening complications associated with the inflammatory and/or prothrombotic state. This case illustrates the challenge associated with the diagnosis and management of chest pain in a patient with SLE and/or APS, particularly in the setting of hypoxic respiratory failure and hemodynamic instability.\n\n【91】Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune condition with heterogeneous clinical presentation and the presence of one or more antinuclear, anti–double-stranded DNA, or anti-Sm antibodies. Systemic lupus erythematosus has a reported prevalence of 25 to 150 cases per 100,000 population. This condition has widespread organ involvement. Cardiac manifestations are also common and can include inflammation of the pericardial, myocardial, and endocardial layers as well as accelerated coronary atherosclerosis formation in the absence of normal risk factors. Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with a higher risk of APS than found in the general population. Among patients with SLE, the prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies ranges from 15% to 34% compared with 1% to 5% in the general population. Antiphospholipid syndrome may develop in 50% to 70% of patients with SLE who harbor antiphospholipid antibodies after 20 years of follow-up.\n\n【92】Patients with APS generate antiphospholipid antibodies that bind to various plasma proteins involved in the anticoagulation pathway, such as protein C, protein S, or thrombomodulin. This process results in an increased risk of thrombi formation in the arterial and venous vessels throughout the body. When the pulmonary vasculature is involved, chest pain accompanied by a bleeding diathesis called DAH can occur. The criterion standard for diagnosing DAH is through fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bloody return on sequential BAL. The presence of at least 20% of 200 macrophages stained positive for hemosiderin can also be used to diagnose DAH in the absence of frank bloody return.\n\n【93】The pathophysiology of DAH in the setting of APS is not completely understood. The most commonly described manifestation of DAH is vascular thrombosis, with resulting end-organ injury mediated by APS-induced activation of endothelial cells and platelets with resultant complement activation and inhibition of anticoagulant factors.\n\n【94】Capillaritis has also been implicated in DAH. This process is mediated by APS-induced up-regulation of endothelial cell adhesion molecules with subsequent neutrophil recruitment and migration into the alveolar septae resulting in tissue destruction and hemorrhage.\n\n【95】Patients with APS who have DAH benefit from systemic glucocorticoids and/or immunosuppressive therapy, such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Unlike other etiologies of DAH, APS-mediated DAH requires continuation of anticoagulation despite an active bleeding process. The rationale behind this requirement is that the bleeding cascade was initiated by a thrombotic event and discontinuation will result in the propagation of existing thrombi and generation of new thrombus.\n\n【96】Coronary artery disease is common in patients with SLE and has considerable impact on morbidity and mortality. According to the Framingham Offspring Study, women in the 35- to 44-year age group who have lupus are more than 50 times more likely to have a myocardial infarction compared with women of similar age without lupus.\n\n【97】Age-specific incidence rates of myocardial infarction and angina in women with systemic lupus erythematosus: comparison with the Framingham Study.\n\n【98】In addition, a recent prospective cohort study evaluating atherosclerotic events in patients with SLE found that 1.8% of the participants were affected within 2 years of study enrollment.\n\n【99】Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics  \nAtherosclerotic vascular events in a multinational inception cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus.\n\n【100】Given the high risk of accelerated atherosclerosis, even in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, coronary angiography in the setting of ECG changes or cardiac enzyme elevation is warranted. The management of coronary artery disease in the setting of SLE and APS with multivessel involvement continues to be controversial. Small case series and retrospective studies have suggested increased perioperative or postoperative complications associated with cardiothoracic procedures, including coronary artery bypass graft surgery.\n\n【101】Cardiovascular surgical outcomes in patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome—a case-series.\n\n【102】At this time, only limited observational data is available documenting the safety and efficacy of percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent placement in this population, and further research is needed. Furthermore, insufficient evidence is available to guide postintervention anticoagulation. For patients who continue to take warfarin, monitoring factor Xa levels is suggested to assess adequate anticoagulation because the INR can be unreliable in these patients. Antiplatelet regimens are recommended after stent placement, and the use of both aspirin and clopidogrel has been suggested. This combination, however, is associated with an increased risk of bleeding complications, particularly in patients receiving glucocorticoids. If a single antiplatelet agent is added to warfarin, clopidogrel is preferred by some experts, as was done in our patient. We recommend collaboration among the patient/family, primary medicine team, and consulting services (cardiology, cardiothoracic surgery, rheumatology) to discuss individualized treatment options in these complex cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:22:01", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:23:00", "cost": 59.362}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:34", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:23:00", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:22:00"}

The broadened perspective on race-related incidence disparities for hematologic malignancies is of great interest.\n\n【1】In accord with these comments, we think that several lines of evidence support the action of susceptibility genes in multiple myeloma (MM) and its precursor, MGUS. In our Ghana study, we assessed the prevalence of MGUS among male Ghanaians and found it to be twice that of male whites in Olmsted County, MN. This pattern is consistent with our observation that African Americans have a 2- to 3-fold higher risk of MGUS and MM than whites but a similar risk of progression from MGUS to MM.\n\n【2】Risk of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and subsequent multiple myeloma among African American and white veterans in the United States.\n\n【3】Another line of evidence favoring genetic factors in the etiology of MGUS and MM is that relatives of patients with MM have a higher risk of developing MGUS and MM than relatives of matched controls. Recently, we conducted a large population-based study to assess risk of MM and MGUS among 22,490 first-degree relatives of 8406 patients diagnosed as having MM in Sweden. In that study, we found a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of developing MGUS and MM among first-degree relatives of patients with MM.\n\n【4】Further, among male Ghanaians in our African study, we found the prevalence of MGUS to be approximately 6% for all age groups (50 to 74 years). This observation contrasts with our findings in male whites, in whom the MGUS prevalence was 1.8%, 2.3%, 3.4%, 3.9%, and 5.1% for the age groups 50 to 54 years, 55 to 59 years, 60 to 64 years, 65 to 69 years, and 70 to 74 years, respectively.

These IgH translocations typically involve 1 of 5 chromosomal partners: 11q13 ( _CCND1_ ), which is the most common; 4p16.3 ( _FGFR-3_ and _MMSET_ ); 6p21 ( _CCND3_ ); 16p23 (c-maf); and 20p11 (mafB).\n\n【14】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【15】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【16】However, IgH translocations are noted only in approximately 50% of all MGUS cases.

In this model, approximately half of MGUS cases are thought to arise from pathogenetic IgH translocations involving 1 of the 5 recurrent partners discussed previously, whereas most of the remaining cases are associated with hyperdiploidy, usually of odd-numbered chromosomes (with the exception of 13).\n\n【17】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【18】Both IgH-translocated MGUS and hyperdiploidy-associated MGUS can be characterized by dysregulation of cyclin D genes.\n\n【19】The observed increase of MGUS among blacks, as well as the excess among first-degree relatives, could be due to unknown environmental factors, such as immune-related or infectious conditions, possibly in combination with genes. In our Ghana study, we assessed the influence of personal history of certain defined infections and risk of MGUS. We found no statistical association between infectious diseases and subsequent MGUS risk. However, as pointed out in our article, information on infectious disorders was based on self-report, which has some limitations.\n\n【20】Our overall interpretation of these findings is that the observed excess of MGUS and MM in blacks supports the hypothesis of a race-related genetic predisposition. In addition, the observed increased risk of MGUS in Ghanaians likely also reflects unknown environmental influences possibly interacting with genetic factors. We are currently investigating the opportunities to map susceptibility genes for MGUS and MM among African Americans using mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium (MALD) markers.\n\n【21】The data cited by Drs Ruiz-Delgado and Ruiz-Argüelles suggest that the admixed Mexican population is also ideal for mapping genes for MGUS, MM, and other hematologic malignancies.\n\n【22】Interestingly, recent gene-expression studies have found selected MGUS cases with strong similarities to patterns observed in patients with MM.\n\n【23】Gene-expression signature of benign monoclonal gammopathy evident in multiple myeloma is linked to good prognosis.\n\n【24】At this time, whether such features are associated with a higher risk of progression to MM is unknown. We consider these observations intriguing in that they hint that expression patterns could ultimately allow us to identify MGUS cases that could be selected for MM prevention trials.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:00:07", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:00:48", "cost": 40.536}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:34", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:00:48", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:00:07"}

In addition to the shared capacity for invading through normal tissues, both cancer cells and cells of the developing placenta create a microenvironment supportive of both immunologic privilege and angiogenesis. Systemic alterations in immunity are also detectable, particularly with respect to a helper T cell type 2 polarization evident in advanced cancers and midtrimester pregnancy. This review summarizes the similarities between growth and immune privilege in cancer and pregnancy and identifies areas for further investigation. Our PubMed search strategy included combinations of terms such as _immune tolerance, pregnancy, cancer, cytokines, angiogenesis_ , and _invasion_ . We did not place any restrictions on publication dates. The knowledge gained from analyzing similarities and differences between the physiologic state of pregnancy and the pathologic state of cancer could lead to identification of new potential targets for cancer therapeutic agents.\n\n【1】CTL ( CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte ), DC ( dendritic cell ), EVT ( extravillous trophoblast ), HLA ( human leukocyte antigen ), IL ( interleukin ), NK ( natural killer ), TH1 ( helper T cell type 1 ), TH2 ( helper T cell type 2 ), Treg ( regulatory T cell ), uNK ( uterine NK )\n\n【2】A substantial body of literature exists describing the mechanisms cancer cells use to escape apoptosis and migrate through normal structures while evading a host immune response. What is not well known, however, is how these complex and interrelated mechanisms are orchestrated, starting with modulation of the immune response within the tumor microenvironment and ending with migration and proliferation of cancer cells at distant sites. One potential model to further study how a single malignant cell could proliferate and then metastasize undetected within a host is that of normal human pregnancy, in which the developing placenta invades the uterus and a semiallogeneic fetus escapes rejection from the maternal immune system.\n\n【3】A multitude of immunomodulatory properties of the fetomaternal interface (placenta) have evolved to allow the survival of the immunologically distinct fetus to parturition without an attack from the maternal immune system. The similarities between the mechanisms involved in fetomaternal and tumor-associated immunologic tolerance are intriguing and suggest a common pattern; however, neither system of immune evasion is perfect. A clear example of placental failure to protect the fetus against maternal immunity is that of Rh incompatibility. In multiparous women sensitized against fetal Rh antigens, re-exposure to fetal Rh antigens with subsequent pregnancy may lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn and fetal death.\n\n【4】Such imperfections of shared mechanisms of immune tolerance between pregnancy and cancer suggest that cancer rejection via immunologic means may be possible, even considering the myriad mechanisms extending immunologic privilege to the fetus as well as cancer cells.\n\n【5】This review summarizes the parallels in proliferation, invasion, and immune privilege between cancer and pregnancy by first detailing shared characteristics of fetal-derived trophoblast cells of the placenta and tumor cells. It then describes the similarities between tolerogenic systems within the tumor microenvironment and the fetomaternal interface. Finally, it provides an overview of the evidence for systemic immune modulation in cancer and pregnancy and suggests the implications of these similarities in designing an integrated approach to cancer therapy. Our PubMed search strategy included combinations of terms such as _immune tolerance, pregnancy, cancer, cytokines, angiogenesis_ , and _invasion_ . We also searched for articles on cellular subsets, including natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory T cells (T <sub>reg </sub> ), and other lymphocyte populations with respect to their presence and function in pregnancy and cancer. We did not place any restrictions on publication dates. A better understanding of how the maternal immune system is altered during the normal processes of implantation, gestation, and labor may translate into individualized, novel therapies aimed at restoring immune competency in patients with advanced malignancies.\n\n【6】SHARED CHARACTERISTICS OF TROPHOBLAST CELLS AND TUMOR CELLS\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Five days after fertilization, the human zygote forms into a structure consisting of 2 primary cell lines: the inner cellmass (or embryoblast) and the trophoblast.\n\n【8】Trophoblast cells constitute the outer layer of the blastocyst, rapidly proliferating and invading the maternal endometrial decidua around day 7. A monolayer of cytotrophoblast cells surrounds the embryonic disc as the embryo completely embeds beneath the uterine decidua. By day 9, cytotrophoblast cells have differentiated into 2 distinct cell types: the syncytiotrophoblast and the extravillous trophoblast (EVT). The multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast cells form the external layer and are terminally differentiated. These cells are involved in fetomaternal nutrient exchanges and endocrine functions (such as β-human chorionic gonadotropic production). In contrast, EVT cells have a proliferative and invasive phenotype, migrating through the syncytiotrophoblast into the uterine wall to anchor the placenta beginning around day 14 after implantation.\n\n【9】These EVT cells display a phenotype strikingly similar to cancer cells with their capacity for proliferation, migration, and establishment of a blood supply, making them a compelling model for oncologic comparison . This review highlights several shared characteristics of trophoblast and tumor cells and discusses them in the context of existing or developmental targeted cancer therapeutics .\n\n【10】FIGURE Similarities between the fetomaternal interface and tumor microenvironment.

By binding to the IGF1R on cytotrophoblast cells, IGF stimulates proliferation through the MAPK pathway and survival via activation of the PI3K pathway.\n\n【48】Normally, levels of IGF are tightly regulated by IGF-binding proteins and protease pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, a binding protein.\n\n【49】Loss of binding protein regulation may contribute to the malignant phenotype.\n\n【50】In cancer cells, the IGF1R pathway is not only mitogenic and antiapoptotic but is involved in protecting cancer cells from damaging effects of chemotherapy and radiation, potentially as a result of its effects on downstream signaling pathways.\n\n【51】Additionally, the fetal form of the insulin receptor IR-A, which is highly expressed in fetal tissues and responsive to IGF2, is also a member of the IGF-signaling system.\n\n【52】In many cancers, including those of the breast and ovary, dysregulation of this fetal form of the insulin receptor becomes the predominant isoform leading to IGF2-stimulated proliferation and survival.\n\n【53】Elevated insulin receptor content in human breast cancer.\n\n【54】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【55】INVASION\n--------\n\n【56】The sine qua non of both a successful pregnancy and the growth of cancer is the establishment of a blood and nutrient supply, and invasion through normal tissues is required for this process. However, whereas cancer cells spread throughout the host and then engage in local proliferation, trophoblasts follow an organized pattern of differentiation from proliferation to invasion without distant metastasis.\n\n【57】Some of the molecular switches involved in this differentiation pattern and their relevance for cancer therapeutic agents are discussed in the sections that follow.\n\n【58】As EVT cells migrate down the cytotrophoblast cell columns into the maternal decidua , they encircle and erode into the maternal spiral arteries and differentiate from a proliferative phenotype into an invasive phenotype.\n\n【59】This differentiation occurs at about 10 to 12 weeks of gestation and is associated with opening of the intervillous space and exposure to maternal blood. Many parallels can be observed between invasive EVT cells and cancer cells. Some of these similarities are highlighted in the sections to follow; for a more in-depth discussion, readers should refer to excellent reviews by Soundararajan and Rao\n\n【60】and Ferretti et al.\n\n【61】Requirements for cellular invasion include changes in cell adhesion molecules, secretion of proteases, and availability of growth factors. An example of a cellular program used by both cancer cells\n\n【62】and trophoblast cells\n\n【63】to promote invasion is epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which results in loss of cell-to-cell contact inhibition. Associated with this program are changes in integrin expression and loss of E cadherin, allowing loss of polarity and enhanced motility.\n\n【64】Localization of E-cadherin in villous, extravillous and vascular trophoblasts during intrauterine, ectopic and molar pregnancy.\n\n【65】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【66】Expression of E-cadherin and its repressor snail in placental tissue of normal, preeclamptic and HELLP pregnancies.\n\n【67】Both trophoblast and cancer cells secrete proteases to degrade extracellular matrix proteins required for dispersal through tissues. The cytoplasm of migratory EVT cells express HSP27, which is correlated with MMP2 activity.\n\n【68】Basal HSP27 levels are unusually high in cancer cells, protecting them from apoptotic stimuli,\n\n【69】and are associated with metastatic potential.\n\n【70】Finally, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor stimulate motility of EVT cells through phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAPKs and the PI3K-dependent proteins, AKT and p38.\n\n【71】Epidermal growth factor-stimulated extravillous cytotrophoblast motility is mediated by the activation of PI3-K, Akt and both p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases.\n\n【72】Epidermal growth factor is associated with tumor cell invasiveness through expression of MMPs.\n\n【73】Switches involved in triggering trophoblast and cancer cell molecular programs for invasion are not completely understood. The Wnt pathway, a system highly conserved across species involved in cellular proliferation and motility, has recently been implicated in switching trophoblast cells from a proliferative to an invasive phenotype.\n\n【74】Activation of the canonical wingless/T-cell factor signaling pathway promotes invasive differentiation of human trophoblast.\n\n【75】Activation of the Wnt pathway is aberrant in many cancers, resulting in escape of β-catenin from proteosomal degradation, with subsequent β-catenin translocation into the cell nucleus and activation of multiple target genes.\n\n【76】Although direct activation of β-catenin alone has shown no effect on motility of EVT cells, inhibition of the Wnt—β-catenin pathway can block blastocyst implantation.\n\n【77】Inactivation of nuclear Wnt-β-catenin signaling limits blastocyst competency for implantation.\n\n【78】In EVT cells, activation of PAR1 (also known as the thrombin receptor) also stabilizes β-catenin and is associated with a proliferative and invasive capacity, whereas application of PAR1-silencing RNA inhibits EVT invasion.\n\n【79】Consistent with the need for tight regulation of invasive trophoblast cells, PAR1 is expressed in EVT cells between the 7th and 10th gestational week but is abruptly shut off by the 12th week.\n\n【80】The pattern of expression of protease-activated receptors (PARs) during early trophoblast development.\n\n【81】Constitutive increased expression of PAR1 can be seen in cancer cells, especially in cells lacking normal p53 activity.\n\n【82】p53 controls hPar1 function and expression.\n\n【83】In vitro assays have shown PAR1 antagonism to inhibit MMP1-induced endothelial cell activation in tumor—endothelial cell communication.\n\n【84】Tumor-derived matrix metalloproteinase-1 targets endothelial proteinase-activated receptor 1 promoting endothelial cell activation.\n\n【85】Whether this system could successfully be targeted for cancer therapy is under investigation. Other signal transduction pathways common in both trophoblast and cancer cell invasion include the JAK-STAT pathway,\n\n【86】FAKs, G proteins, Rho-associated kinase, MAPKs, PI3K, and SMAD family proteins.\n\n【87】All of these pathways represent areas of current anticancer therapeutic development.\n\n【88】As EVTs acquire an invasive phenotype during placental development, they become polyploid (4N-8N) by switching from mitotic division to endoreduplication,\n\n【89】a process in which G2 or M phase (4N) cells replicate DNA without undergoing mitosis. In trophoblast cell lines, polyploid trophoblast giant cells are relatively resistant to the DNA-damaging effects of radiation,\n\n【90】illustrating a mechanism by which survival is promoted in invasive trophoblast cells. This process can also be observed in cancer cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. Endoreduplication can be induced in tumor cells on exposure to genotoxic agents such as paclitaxel\n\n【91】Cell cycle checkpoint efficiency and cellular response to paclitaxel in prostate cancer cells.\n\n【92】and cisplatin; a nonproliferative, senescent state in a small population of cells is induced in the latter case. The polyploid tumor cells can undergo depolyploidization to form diploid, cisplatin-resistant escape cells.\n\n【93】Tumor cells can escape DNA-damaging cisplatin through DNA endoreduplication and reversible polyploidy.\n\n【94】In cells with an impaired p53 system, treatment with the Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 leads to endoreduplication followed by apoptosis.\n\n【95】However, in 2 wild-type p53 cancer cell lines, stabilization of p53 by Nutlin-3a, an inhibitor of the p53-binding protein MDM2, leads to initial endoreduplication followed by the emergence of stable radiation- and cisplatin-resistant tetraploid clones.\n\n【96】A better understanding of the EVT endoreduplication process may lead to the development of targeted drugs to maintain tumor cell chemotherapeutic sensitivity.\n\n【97】VASCULOGENIC MIMICRY\n--------------------\n\n【98】As trophoblasts invade maternal spiral arteries, they further differentiate to display a vascular phenotype in a process termed _vasculogenic mimicry_ , in which cells other than endothelial cells form vascular structures.\n\n【99】Human cytotrophoblasts adopt a vascular phenotype as they differentiate: a strategy for successful endovascular invasion?\n\n【100】Vasculogenic mimicry can also be observed in aggressive cancers, and the genes and signaling pathways involved with the process of vasculogenic mimicry may be shared between EVT and cancer cells.\n\n【101】For example, the matrix glycoprotein—binding galectin 3 is highly expressed in EVT cells.\n\n【102】Galectin-3 also appears to be a key factor in the development of an endothelial phenotype and the tube formation well described in aggressive melanomas.\n\n【103】Galectin inhibitors are in preclinical testing as cancer therapeutic agents.\n\n【104】Synthetic inhibitors of galectin-1 and -3 selectively modulate homotypic cell aggregation and tumor cell apoptosis.\n\n【105】Mig-7 was found in circulating tumor cells and tumor tissue (regardless of tissue of origin) from more than 200 patients with cancer; notably, it was absent from healthy controls.\n\n【106】Mig-7 expression is associated with invasion and vasculogenic mimicry in cancer cells and also has recently been demonstrated in invasive embryonic cytotrophoblasts, peaking when EVT cells invade maternal decidua and remodel the vasculature during early placental development.\n\n【107】This finding represents the only known expression of Mig-7 in noncancerous cells. Cancers with an endothelial phenotype have not been shown to be responsive to antiangiogenic therapies.\n\n【108】Effects of angiogenesis inhibitors on vascular network formation by human endothelial and melanoma cells.\n\n【109】Because cancer therapy aimed at proliferating cells is less likely to be effective in invading cells,\n\n【110】galactin-3, Mig-7, and other pathways involved in vasculogenic mimicry may also be important targets for cancer therapy.\n\n【111】ANGIOGENESIS\n------------\n\n【112】Molecular circuits involved in neoangiogenesis separate from vasculogenic mimicry are also likely shared between EVT and tumor cells.

Historically, the placenta was considered an inert, mechanical barrier protecting the semiallogeneic fetus from maternal immunologic attack.\n\n【136】Current evidence, however, supports just the opposite—many maternal and placental immunomodulatory factors are required for adequate placental invasion. Around 40% of decidual cells are cells of the innate immune system (eg, NK cells, macrophages, and DCs), a substantial proportion considering that the uterus is a nonlymphoid organ.\n\n【137】Likewise, although cancer previously has been considered immunologically invisible to the host, many recent studies support the notion that cancer cells actively engage immune cells; for example, the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has been well described in the literature.\n\n【138】The main components of the maternal immune response at the fetomaternal interface and the similarities to the tumor microenvironment are discussed in the sections that follow.\n\n【139】The most abundant immune cell present at the fetomaternal interface is the uterine NK (uNK) cell, which constitutes approximately 70% of all immune cells found in this tissue.\n\n【140】Recruitment of circulating NK cells through decidual tissues: a possible mechanism controlling NK cell accumulation in the uterus during early pregnancy.\n\n【141】Uterine NK cells are thought to be recruited from peripheral blood when interleukin (IL)-15 is secreted by endometrial stromal cells.\n\n【142】They are distinct from peripheral blood NK cells in that they do not express CD16, the FcRγIIIA receptor required for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\n【143】The mechanisms associated with this loss of CD16 are unclear but may be related to high levels of TGF-β within the microenvironment.\n\n【144】TGFβ promotes conversion of CD16 <sup>+ </sup> peripheral blood NK cells into CD16- NK cells with similarities to decidual NK cells.\n\n【145】Also, in contrast to peripheral blood NK cells, uNK cells are more immunomodulatory than cytotoxic, secreting galectin 1 to induce tolerogenic DCs\n\n【146】Human decidual natural killer cells are a unique NK cell subset with immunomodulatory potential.\n\n【147】as well as angiogenic factors VEGF and PGF that are important for decidual remodeling.\n\n【148】Decidual NK cells regulate key developmental processes at the human fetal-maternal interface.\n\n【149】An improper balance of cytotoxic to regulatory NK cells could contribute to recurrent miscarriage and pre-eclampsia.\n\n【150】Expression of IL-15 and NK cell infiltration have been reported in many different malignancies,\n\n【151】IFN-γ acts on T cells to induce NK cell mobilization and accumulation in target organs.\n\n【152】including renal cell carcinoma,\n\n【153】Membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-15 on renal tumor cells rescues natural killer cells from IL-2 starvation-induced apoptosis.\n\n【154】with variable prognostic implications. Recently, tumor-infiltrating CD16-NK cells have also been characterized and appear to behave similarly to uNK cells with respect to cytokine production and reduced cytotoxic activity.\n\n【155】Natural killer cells infiltrating human nonsmall-cell lung cancer are enriched in CD56 bright CD16 (-) cells and display an impaired capability to kill tumor cells.\n\n【156】A closer look at factors that determine the balance of killer and regulatory NK cells during pregnancy may help identify mechanisms that shift immunity toward NK cytotoxic activity in patients with cancer.\n\n【157】Also infiltrating the decidua, albeit in smaller numbers than uNK cells, are macrophages, T <sub>reg </sub> , and DCs. Macrophages phagocytose apoptotic EVT cells and secrete IL-10 and IDO, contributing to the tolerogenic T <sub>H </sub> 2 milieu.\n\n【158】Gene expression profiling of decidual macrophages supports an immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory phenotype with higher expression of _CCL18, IGF1, IDO_ , neuropilin 1, and other genes associated with M2-polarized macrophages.\n\n【159】Gene expression profiling of human decidual macrophages: evidence for immunosuppressive phenotype.\n\n【160】Tumor-associated macrophages can be both inflammatory and immunosuppressive, and T <sub>H </sub> 1/T <sub>H </sub> 2 polarization is effected through the activation of NF-κB (also known as NFKB1).\n\n【161】In fact, in vitro studies suggest that tumor-associated macrophages may be re-educated to display a classically activated rather than an M2 phenotype by inhibition of inhibitory kappa B kinase β, the major activator of NF-κB.\n\n【162】“Re-educating” tumor-associated macrophages by targeting NF-κB.\n\n【163】Regulatory T cells are additional important mediators of tolerance in both pregnancy and cancer. Immunophenotypically, these cells express surface CD4, CD25, and FOXP3, and they expand in both decidua\n\n【164】and peripheral blood\n\n【165】during normal pregnancies. This expansion is antigen-specific and is induced by paternal/fetal alloantigens\n\n【166】and not simply by hormonal changes in pregnancy.\n\n【167】Mechanisms of action of regulatory T cells specific for paternal antigens during pregnancy.\n\n【168】A decrease in this lymphocyte subset is associated with spontaneous abortion\n\n【169】and pre-eclampsia.\n\n【170】Distinct subsets of regulatory T cells during pregnancy: is the imbalance of these subsets involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia?\n\n【171】Regulatory T cells are also expanded in cancer and are implicated in impaired antitumor immunity,\n\n【172】suppression of effector T lymphocyte proliferation,\n\n【173】CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD25 <sup>+ </sup> CD127 (low/-) regulatory T cells express Foxp3 and suppress effector T cell proliferation and contribute to gastric cancers progression.\n\n【174】and increased tumor blood vessel density,\n\n【175】The presence of tumor-infiltrating FOXP3 <sup>+ </sup> lymphocytes correlates with intratumoral angiogenesis in endometrial cancer.\n\n【176】suggesting an important link between immunity and angiogenesis. Regulatory T cells in patients with cancer also recognize tumor-specific antigens and proliferate in response to antigenic stimulation.\n\n【177】Targeting the T <sub>reg </sub> population to boost antitumor immunity is under investigation with agents such as denileukin diftitox (IL2/diphtheria fusion protein) or LMB-2 (Fv fragment of CD25 antibody/ _Pseudomonas_ endotoxin A fusion protein) and CTLA-4 inhibitors.\n\n【178】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【179】Some of the benefit of cytotoxic chemotherapy may be derived from concomitant impairment of the immunosuppressive T <sub>reg </sub> proliferation driven by the cancer.\n\n【180】Antigen-presenting CD83 <sup>+ </sup> DCs are involved in the maintenance of the T <sub>H </sub> 2-predominant state in decidual tissues,\n\n【181】Predominance of Th2-promoting dendritic cells in early human pregnancy decidua.\n\n【182】as well as at other mucosal surfaces.\n\n【183】Human decidua contains potent immunostimulatory CD83 <sup>+ </sup> dendritic cells.\n\n【184】However, the role of the DC is likely more complex than antigen presentation and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. Ablation of uterine DCs leads to decidualization failure and embryo resorption in mice; this occurs even with syngeneic pregnancy in mice in which alloantigens are absent.\n\n【185】Uterine DCs are crucial for decidua formation during embryo implantation in mice.\n\n【186】Dendritic cells also represent another link between immunity and angiogenesis, secreting soluble FLT1 (also known as VEGFR1) and TGF-β1 required for endothelial cell survival and vascular maturation. In the absence of DCs, angiogenesis is severely impaired. In cancer, DCs also play a role that is more than immunoregulatory through their production of potent angiogenic growth factors. Moreover, cancer cells can secrete substances that suppress maturation of DCs, including VEGF, TGF-β, hepatocyte growth factor, and osteopontin, thereby maintaining a proangiogenic, immature DC phenotype.\n\n【187】Expression of certain cell surface molecules on both trophoblast and cancer cells can also confer immunologic protection. Among the most important of these molecules is the nonpolymorphic, highly conserved class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules such as HLAG\n\n【188】 in contrast, the highly diverse classical HLA class I proteins A, B, and C are essential in cell-mediated immune responses. In fact, in trophoblast cells, interferon-γ fails to stimulate classical HLA class I expression.\n\n【189】A similar property of down-regulated or absent classical HLA class I expression can cloak cancer cells from the host's immune system.\n\n【190】Cancer treatment modalities including gamma irradiation,\n\n【191】Gamma-radiation upregulates MHC class I/II and ICAM-I molecules in multiple myeloma cell lines and primary tumors.\n\n【192】radiopharmaceutical samarium-153-ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate,\n\n【193】The use of chelated radionuclide (samarium-153-ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate) to modulate phenotype of tumor cells and enhance T cell-mediated killing.\n\n【194】and chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil\n\n【195】5-fluorouracil derivatives induce differentiation mediated by tubulin and HLA class I modulation.\n\n【196】and hypomethylating agents\n\n【197】Functional up-regulation of human leukocyte antigen class I antigens expression by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine in cutaneous melanoma: immunotherapeutic implications.\n\n【198】increase HLA class I expression.\n\n【199】Expression of HLAG on trophoblast cells and cancer cells has important immunomodulatory effects. In the placenta, HLAG expression is most evident on EVTs at the fetomaternal interface, with lower expression at the proliferative area of the villous column and increased expression with invasive, interstitial, and endovascular EVT cells.\n\n【200】Human placental HLA-G expression is restricted to differentiated cytotrophoblasts.\n\n【201】On the basis of sequence homologies, _HLAG_ has been proposed as the ancestral MHC class I gene and has only a few known sequence variations in humans, in sharp contrast to the profound allelic diversity (measured in the hundreds of allelic variants) of classical MHC class I genes.\n\n【202】Evolution of MHC-G in primates: a different kind of molecule for each group of species.\n\n【203】Human leukocyte antigen-G interacts with NK cells via inhibitory receptors, such as CD94/NKG2A, ILT2, and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor KIR2DL4.\n\n【204】The role of HLAG is to suppress cytolytic killing by both NK and cytotoxic T cells, induce apoptosis of immune cells, regulate cytokine production in blood mononuclear cells, and reduce stimulatory capacity and impair maturation of DCs (reviewed in Hunt et al\n\n【205】). Within the tumor microenvironment, the generation of HLAG <sup>+ </sup> —suppressive NK cells occurs by trogocytosis (ie, the rapid cell-to-cell contact-dependent transfer of membranes and associated molecules from one cell to another), leading to the inhibition of other HLAG <sup>+ </sup> (cross-inhibition) or HLAG <sup>− </sup> NK cells through HLAG and ILT2 cross-linking.\n\n【206】Trogocytosis-based generation of suppressive NK cells.\n\n【207】Expression of HLAG is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders,\n\n【208】HLA-G and lymphoproliferative disorders.\n\n【209】melanoma,\n\n【210】Quantitative HLA-G expression in metastasising and non-metastasising primary thin cutaneous melanomas \\[letter\\].\n\n【211】mesothelioma,\n\n【212】Expression of HLA-G in malignant mesothelioma and clinically aggressive breast carcinoma.\n\n【213】breast carcinoma,\n\n【214】Expression of HLA-G in malignant mesothelioma and clinically aggressive breast carcinoma.\n\n【215】ovarian carcinoma,\n\n【216】HLA-G expression in effusions is a possible marker of tumor susceptibility to chemotherapy in ovarian carcinoma.\n\n【217】renal cell carcinoma,\n\n【218】squamous esophageal cancer,\n\n【219】gastric carcinoma,\n\n【220】cervical cancer,\n\n【221】non—small cell lung cancer,\n\n【222】bladder cancer,\n\n【223】Expression of HLA-G in cancer bladder.\n\n【224】prostate cancer,\n\n【225】endometrial cancer,\n\n【226】colorectal cancer,\n\n【227】and myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n【228】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【229】Unfavourable clinical implications for HLA-G expression in acute myeloid leukaemia.\n\n【230】However, relatively little is known about the regulation of the expression of this important immunomodulatory molecule.\n\n【231】Regulation of HLAG expression may be at the epigenetic level, with transcription of HLAG being detectable in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine.\n\n【232】Some preliminary evidence also supports a micro-RNA regulatory mechanism.\n\n【233】Clearly, HLAG represents an attractive target for immune-based cancer therapies given its preferential expression in many malignancies as well as limited expression in normal tissues.\n\n【234】The HLA-G gene is expressed at a low mRNA level in different human cells and tissues.\n\n【235】Targeting HLAG with a peptide-based vaccine strategy to develop a cytotoxic T-cell response against tumor cells bearing the molecule has proved feasible,\n\n【236】HLA-G as a target molecule in specific immunotherapy against renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【237】although much work remains before other methods of HLAG inhibition could lead to restoration of antitumor immunity.\n\n【238】Other cell surface tolerance signals common between trophoblasts and cancer cells include CD200 (OX-2) and CEACAM-1.

Implantation of the blastocyst occurs in a T <sub>H </sub> 1-predominant (inflammatory) milieu, but the fetomaternal interface must transition to a T <sub>H </sub> 2-polarized (immunologically tolerant) state for pregnancy to continue (for an excellent review, refer to van Mourik et al\n\n【258】). However, before implantation can occur, the endometrial lining must be receptive in the so-called window of implantation, in which many immunomodulatory genes are up-regulated monthly during the midsecretory phase of the menstrual cycle.\n\n【259】Under the influence of progesterone, the endometrial epithelium up-regulates decay-accelerating factor and osteoponin expression, and the endometrial stroma increases IL-15 expression.\n\n【260】Global gene profiling in human endometrium during the window of implantation.\n\n【261】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【262】Expression of complement regulatory proteins (eg, decay-accelerating factor) is a well-established immunomodulatory mechanism used by many cancers to escape complement-mediated cell death and evade an immune response by inhibiting T-cell proliferation.\n\n【263】Osteopontin has T <sub>H </sub> 1 cytokine functions and is chemotactic for macrophages, T cells, and DCs, the last of which it induces to secrete IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α).\n\n【264】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【265】Osteopontin functionally activates dendritic cells and induces their differentiation toward a Th1-polarizing phenotype.\n\n【266】Osteopontin is overexpressed in many cancers and is associated with metastatic potential.\n\n【267】Additionally, tissues that physiologically express high levels of osteopontin, such as bone, lung, and liver, may create a receptive microenvironment for metastasis via interaction with osteopontin receptor CD44 on the surface of cancer cells.\n\n【268】RANTES (CCL5) is a chemokine produced by trophoblasts that may play a role in apoptosis of potentially harmful maternal CD3 <sup>+ </sup> cells.\n\n【269】A potential tolerogenic immune mechanism in a trophoblast cell line through the activation of chemokine-induced T cell death and regulatory T cell modulation.\n\n【270】Melanoma cells can induce tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to secrete RANTES and subsequently undergo apoptosis as another mechanism to evade an immune response.\n\n【271】Trophoblast cells also secrete chemoattractant cytokines, such as GRO-α, MCP1, and IL-8, to actively recruit the CD14 <sup>+ </sup> monocytes to the fetomaternal interface.\n\n【272】Trophoblast-macrophage interactions: a regulatory network for the protection of pregnancy.\n\n【273】GRO-α is an oncogenic and angiogenic cytokine driven by RAS, which is inappropriately activated in most cancers.\n\n【274】Capable of inducing vascular permeability along with mononuclear cell recruitment, MCP1 is associated with angiogenesis and malignant pleural effusions.\n\n【275】A central role for tumor-derived monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in malignant pleural effusion.\n\n【276】Inhibition of MCP1 can lead to reduced malignant angiogenesis and recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages in a mouse model of melanoma.\n\n【277】Mutant MCP-1 therapy inhibits tumor angiogenesis and growth of malignant melanoma in mice.\n\n【278】Finally, the IL-8 pathway is well known to be a central immune and angiogenic factor within the tumor microenvironment and is important in stress-induced chemotherapeutic resistance.\n\n【279】A tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme, IDO is important in promoting tolerance by inhibiting proliferation of lymphocytes both at the fetomaternal interface\n\n【280】and tumor microenvironment.\n\n【281】Tryptophan levels have been observed to decrease in pregnancy with a return to normal, nonpregnant levels in the puerperium,\n\n【282】possibly a result of tryptophan degradation by IDO-expressing trophoblast cells.

Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 9 deregulation is an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis.\n\n【341】Expressed frequently in lung carcinomas,\n\n【342】PSG1 is associated with estrogen receptor negativity and a higher risk of death in early-stage breast cancer.\n\n【343】Glycodelin may be involved in tumor angiogenesis by increasing VEGF release in many cell lines.\n\n【344】Angiogenic role for glycodelin in tumorigenesis.\n\n【345】An inhibitor of TGF-β2 (overexpressed in many cancers) is in phase 1/2 cancer clinical trials.\n\n【346】Thrombospondin 1 is an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, although its expression in tumor stroma may render tumor cells insensitive to VEGF and help maintain tumor cell dormancy.\n\n【347】Another endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor, PEDF, may have anti-invasive effects on tumor cells.\n\n【348】MIF can stabilize HIF-1α, a factor central to cellular response to hypoxia.\n\n【349】Galectin1 expression within tumors and the stromal tissues is positively correlated with cancer aggressiveness\n\n【350】and a diminished T-cell response.\n\n【351】Another soluble immunomodulator, soluble CD30, a member of the tumor necrosis superfamily of receptors and marker of T <sub>H </sub> 2 polarization, is increased in women with normal pregnancies and reduced in those with preeclampsia and intrauterine growth retardation.\n\n【352】Maternal serum soluble CD30 is increased in normal pregnancy, but decreased in preeclampsia and small for gestational age pregnancies.\n\n【353】In addition to being prognostic in patients with CD30 <sup>+ </sup> classical Hodgkin lymphoma,\n\n【354】Plasma cytokine and soluble receptor signature predicts outcome of patients with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma: a study from the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte.\n\n【355】soluble CD30 is a potential marker of chronic B cell hyperactivation and can predict those at risk of AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n【356】The identification of common immunomodulators helps expand the concept of tolerance in pregnancy and cancer beyond T <sub>H </sub> 2 and toward a more complete understanding of chronic inflammation, angiogenesis, and immunologic privilege.\n\n【357】IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER THERAPEUTICS\n------------------------------------\n\n【358】As a healthy pregnancy progresses toward parturition, several changes within the mother reflect a restoration of active, T <sub>H </sub> 1-predominant immunity. Although T <sub>reg </sub> levels stay constant until the postpartum period,\n\n【359】a gradual return of CD16 <sup>+ </sup> NK cells is observed in late pregnancy.\n\n【360】Suppressed earlier in pregnancy, circulating cytotoxic γδ-T cells increase with the onset of labor.\n\n【361】Interleukin 2 levels decrease while granulocyte macrophage colony—stimulating factor and interferon-γ increase through the third trimester and even more markedly at the onset of labor.\n\n【362】Increased expression of genes associated with acuteinflammation and neutrophil and monocyte influx has been observed in human fetal membranes at parturition.\n\n【363】Human spontaneous labor without histologic chorioamnionitis is characterized by an acute inflammation gene expression signature.\n\n【364】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【365】Concomitant with an increase in the potent uterine contractile prostanoid PGF-2α, proinflammatory cytokines and MMPs prepare the uterus for labor.\n\n【366】Markedly down-regulated at term compared with midgestation are genes involved in angiogenesis, such as angiopoietin 2.\n\n【367】Gene expression profiling of the human maternal-fetal interface reveals dramatic changes between midgestation and term.\n\n【368】Taken together, these changes support a transition from a T <sub>H </sub> 2 to a T <sub>H </sub> 1 polarity during the third trimester.\n\n【369】In contrast, patients with advanced malignancies continue to experience a progressive failure of antitumor immunity, which has been associated with a T <sub>H </sub> 2-polarization and VEGF-driven chronic inflammation.\n\n【370】We have identified the expression of immunomodulatory genes known to be supportive of pregnancy in our own patients with metastatic melanoma via gene-expression profiling (unpublished data). We have also verified that these immunomodulatory genes are differentially expressed in melanoma vs benign melanocytic nevi in 2 independent publically available datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information/GenBank GEO database: GSE4587,\n\n【371】which was analyzed on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and GSE3189,\n\n【372】Novel genes associated with malignant melanoma but not benign melanocytic lesions.\n\n【373】which was analyzed on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Array Set HG-U133A platform (Affymetrix). We selected approximately 70 immunomodulatory genes on the basis of our critical review of the obstetrics literature, log-transformed the raw data, and performed an analysis of variance on this gene set on Partek 6.4 software. A summary of results is listed in Table 2 . Osteopontin and other important components of innate immunity such as _TLR2_ and _TLR4_ and _PTX3_ were significantly up-regulated in melanoma compared with benign nevi. Galectins 1 and 9 were also significantly up-regulated compared with nevi. Notably down-regulated in melanoma were genes known to be up-regulated in term placenta,\n\n【374】Gene expression profiling of the human maternal-fetal interface reveals dramatic changes between midgestation and term.\n\n【375】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【376】Profiling gene expression in human placentae of different gestational ages: an OPRU Network and UW SCOR Study.\n\n【377】including _LPL, FABP4_ , and _FZD10_ (a Wnt receptor). Overall, this pattern is supportive of our theory that tumor cells use similar mechanisms of immune escape as those cells of the developing placenta, although these similarities have not yet been studied in a systematic fashion. Given what we have learned about the similarities between the placenta and tumor microenvironment, we plan to next comprehensively evaluate changes in systemic immune homeostasis in pregnancy vs cancer in order to prioritize potential therapeutic targets. In particular, identifying immunologic distinctions between pregnancy and cancer will be critical for this process.\n\n【378】TABLE 2 Immunomodulatory Genes Differentially Expressed in Melanoma vs Benign Melanocytic Lesions\n\n【379】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【380】IL-8 = interleukin 8.

The challenge for investigators in this field will be to extend our observations beyond the T <sub>H </sub> 1/T <sub>H </sub> 2 paradigm in both pregnancy and cancer to a model that can both assess the status and guide treatment of malignancies in an individualized, rational, real-time manner. A critical need exists for the development of treatments aimed at all aspects of cancer: malignant proliferation, invasion, vasculogenic mimicry, angiogenesis, and immune privilege. Studying how all these aspects are orchestrated in the predictable, physiologic process of pregnancy can facilitate the search for novel cancer treatment strategies, from cytotoxic chemotherapy to biologic agents and immunologic adjuncts, in the often unpredictable and arduous fight against the pathologic process of cancer.\n\n【386】### Glossary of Genetics Terminology\n\n【387】_AKT_\n\n【388】v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog\n\n【389】_ALK_\n\n【390】anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase\n\n【391】_BCL2_\n\n【392】B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2\n\n【393】_CDK_\n\n【394】cyclin dependent kinase\n\n【395】_CEACAM1_\n\n【396】carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (biliary glycoprotein)\n\n【397】_CMET_ (also known as _MET_ )\n\n【398】met proto-oncogene (hepatocyte growth factor) receptor\n\n【399】_CSF_\n\n【400】colony-stimulating factor\n\n【401】_CSF1R_\n\n【402】CSF type 1 receptor\n\n【403】_CXCR4_\n\n【404】chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4\n\n【405】_EGF_\n\n【406】epidermal growth factor (beta-urogastrone)\n\n【407】_ERK_\n\n【408】extracellular signal—related kinase\n\n【409】_FABP4_\n\n【410】fatty acid—binding protein 4\n\n【411】_FAK_\n\n【412】focal adhesion kinase\n\n【413】_FAS_\n\n【414】Fas (TNF receptor superfamily, member 6)\n\n【415】_FASL_\n\n【416】FAS ligand\n\n【417】_FCγIIIA_\n\n【418】FC gamma receptor III A\n\n【419】_FGF_\n\n【420】fibroblast growth factor\n\n【421】_FLT1_\n\n【422】fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor receptor)\n\n【423】_FOXP3_\n\n【424】forkhead box P3\n\n【425】_FZD10_\n\n【426】frizzled homolog 10\n\n【427】_GRO-α_\n\n【428】growth-related oncogene α\n\n【429】_HGF_\n\n【430】hepatocyte growth factor\n\n【431】_HIF-1α_\n\n【432】hypoxia inducible factor 1α\n\n【433】_HSP27_\n\n【434】heat shock protein 27\n\n【435】_IDO_\n\n【436】indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase\n\n【437】_IGF_\n\n【438】insulinlike growth factor\n\n【439】_IGF1R_\n\n【440】IGF type 1 receptor\n\n【441】_ILT2_\n\n【442】Ig-like transcript 2\n\n【443】_JAK_\n\n【444】janus kinase\n\n【445】_LGALS_ 1\n\n【446】galactin 1\n\n【447】_LGALS_ 9\n\n【448】galactin 9\n\n【449】_LPL_\n\n【450】lipoprotein lipase\n\n【451】_MAPK_\n\n【452】mitogen-activated protein kinase\n\n【453】_MCP_ 1\n\n【454】monocyte chemoattractant protein 1\n\n【455】_MEK_ (also known as _MAP2K_ )\n\n【456】MAPK/ERK kinase\n\n【457】_MIF_\n\n【458】macrophage migration inhibitory factor\n\n【459】_Mig-_ 7\n\n【460】migration-induction protein 7\n\n【461】_MDM_ 2\n\n【462】mouse double minute 2\n\n【463】_MMP_\n\n【464】matrix metalloproteinase\n\n【465】_MTOR_\n\n【466】mammalian target of rapamycin\n\n【467】_MUC1_\n\n【468】mucin 1\n\n【469】_NF-κB_\n\n【470】nuclear factor κB\n\n【471】_p38_\n\n【472】tumor protein 38\n\n【473】_PAR1_\n\n【474】protease activated receptor 1\n\n【475】_PDGF_\n\n【476】platelet-derived growth factor\n\n【477】_PDGFR_\n\n【478】PDGF receptor\n\n【479】_PEDF_\n\n【480】pigment epithelial—derived factor\n\n【481】_PGE2_\n\n【482】prostaglandin E2\n\n【483】_PGF_\n\n【484】placental growth factor\n\n【485】_PI3K_\n\n【486】phosphoinositide-3 kinase\n\n【487】_PSG1_\n\n【488】pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1\n\n【489】_PTX3_\n\n【490】pentraxin 3\n\n【491】_RANTES_ (also known as _CCL5_ )\n\n【492】regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted\n\n【493】_RAF_\n\n【494】v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1\n\n【495】_RAS_\n\n【496】rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog\n\n【497】_SDF_ (also known as _CXCL12_ )\n\n【498】stromal-derived factor 1\n\n【499】_SPP1_\n\n【500】osteopontin\n\n【501】_STAT_\n\n【502】signal transducers and activator of transcription\n\n【503】_TGF_\n\n【504】transforming growth factor\n\n【505】_TIM3_ (also known as _HAVCR2_ )\n\n【506】T cell immunoglobulin mucin 3\n\n【507】_TIMP2_\n\n【508】tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2\n\n【509】_TLR_\n\n【510】toll-like receptor\n\n【511】_TNF_\n\n【512】tumor necrosis factor\n\n【513】_TRAIL_\n\n【514】TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand\n\n【515】_TRAILR_\n\n【516】TRAIL receptor\n\n【517】_uPA_\n\n【518】urokinase plasminogen activator\n\n【519】_VEGF_\n\n【520】vascular endothelial growth factor\n\n【521】_VEGFR_\n\n【522】VEGF receptor\n\n【523】_waf1/cip1_ (also known as _CDKN1A_ )\n\n【524】cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A\n\n【525】_Wnt_\n\n【526】wingless/T-cell factor\n\n【527】_XIAP_\n\n【528】X-link inhibitor of apoptosis protein\n\n【529】Author Interview\n----------------\n\n【530】Interview with Dr. Shernan Holtan", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "For expansion of all gene symbols, see Glossary of Genetics Terminology at the end of the article.", "content": "【0】Cancer and Pregnancy: Parallels in Growth, Invasion, and Immune Modulation and Implications for Cancer Therapeutic Agents\nMany proliferative, invasive, and immune tolerance mechanisms that support normal human pregnancy are also exploited by malignancies to establish a nutrient supply and evade or edit the host immune response. In addition to the shared capacity for invading through normal tissues, both cancer cells and cells of the developing placenta create a microenvironment supportive of both immunologic privilege and angiogenesis. Systemic alterations in immunity are also detectable, particularly with respect to a helper T cell type 2 polarization evident in advanced cancers and midtrimester pregnancy. This review summarizes the similarities between growth and immune privilege in cancer and pregnancy and identifies areas for further investigation. Our PubMed search strategy included combinations of terms such as _immune tolerance, pregnancy, cancer, cytokines, angiogenesis_ , and _invasion_ . We did not place any restrictions on publication dates. The knowledge gained from analyzing similarities and differences between the physiologic state of pregnancy and the pathologic state of cancer could lead to identification of new potential targets for cancer therapeutic agents.\n\n【1】CTL ( CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte ), DC ( dendritic cell ), EVT ( extravillous trophoblast ), HLA ( human leukocyte antigen ), IL ( interleukin ), NK ( natural killer ), TH1 ( helper T cell type 1 ), TH2 ( helper T cell type 2 ), Treg ( regulatory T cell ), uNK ( uterine NK )\n\n【2】A substantial body of literature exists describing the mechanisms cancer cells use to escape apoptosis and migrate through normal structures while evading a host immune response. What is not well known, however, is how these complex and interrelated mechanisms are orchestrated, starting with modulation of the immune response within the tumor microenvironment and ending with migration and proliferation of cancer cells at distant sites. One potential model to further study how a single malignant cell could proliferate and then metastasize undetected within a host is that of normal human pregnancy, in which the developing placenta invades the uterus and a semiallogeneic fetus escapes rejection from the maternal immune system.\n\n【3】A multitude of immunomodulatory properties of the fetomaternal interface (placenta) have evolved to allow the survival of the immunologically distinct fetus to parturition without an attack from the maternal immune system. The similarities between the mechanisms involved in fetomaternal and tumor-associated immunologic tolerance are intriguing and suggest a common pattern; however, neither system of immune evasion is perfect. A clear example of placental failure to protect the fetus against maternal immunity is that of Rh incompatibility. In multiparous women sensitized against fetal Rh antigens, re-exposure to fetal Rh antigens with subsequent pregnancy may lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn and fetal death.\n\n【4】Such imperfections of shared mechanisms of immune tolerance between pregnancy and cancer suggest that cancer rejection via immunologic means may be possible, even considering the myriad mechanisms extending immunologic privilege to the fetus as well as cancer cells.\n\n【5】This review summarizes the parallels in proliferation, invasion, and immune privilege between cancer and pregnancy by first detailing shared characteristics of fetal-derived trophoblast cells of the placenta and tumor cells. It then describes the similarities between tolerogenic systems within the tumor microenvironment and the fetomaternal interface. Finally, it provides an overview of the evidence for systemic immune modulation in cancer and pregnancy and suggests the implications of these similarities in designing an integrated approach to cancer therapy. Our PubMed search strategy included combinations of terms such as _immune tolerance, pregnancy, cancer, cytokines, angiogenesis_ , and _invasion_ . We also searched for articles on cellular subsets, including natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory T cells (T <sub>reg </sub> ), and other lymphocyte populations with respect to their presence and function in pregnancy and cancer. We did not place any restrictions on publication dates. A better understanding of how the maternal immune system is altered during the normal processes of implantation, gestation, and labor may translate into individualized, novel therapies aimed at restoring immune competency in patients with advanced malignancies.\n\n【6】SHARED CHARACTERISTICS OF TROPHOBLAST CELLS AND TUMOR CELLS\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Five days after fertilization, the human zygote forms into a structure consisting of 2 primary cell lines: the inner cellmass (or embryoblast) and the trophoblast.\n\n【8】Trophoblast cells constitute the outer layer of the blastocyst, rapidly proliferating and invading the maternal endometrial decidua around day 7. A monolayer of cytotrophoblast cells surrounds the embryonic disc as the embryo completely embeds beneath the uterine decidua. By day 9, cytotrophoblast cells have differentiated into 2 distinct cell types: the syncytiotrophoblast and the extravillous trophoblast (EVT). The multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast cells form the external layer and are terminally differentiated. These cells are involved in fetomaternal nutrient exchanges and endocrine functions (such as β-human chorionic gonadotropic production). In contrast, EVT cells have a proliferative and invasive phenotype, migrating through the syncytiotrophoblast into the uterine wall to anchor the placenta beginning around day 14 after implantation.\n\n【9】These EVT cells display a phenotype strikingly similar to cancer cells with their capacity for proliferation, migration, and establishment of a blood supply, making them a compelling model for oncologic comparison . This review highlights several shared characteristics of trophoblast and tumor cells and discusses them in the context of existing or developmental targeted cancer therapeutics .\n\n【10】FIGURE Similarities between the fetomaternal interface and tumor microenvironment.

By binding to the IGF1R on cytotrophoblast cells, IGF stimulates proliferation through the MAPK pathway and survival via activation of the PI3K pathway.\n\n【48】Normally, levels of IGF are tightly regulated by IGF-binding proteins and protease pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, a binding protein.\n\n【49】Loss of binding protein regulation may contribute to the malignant phenotype.\n\n【50】In cancer cells, the IGF1R pathway is not only mitogenic and antiapoptotic but is involved in protecting cancer cells from damaging effects of chemotherapy and radiation, potentially as a result of its effects on downstream signaling pathways.\n\n【51】Additionally, the fetal form of the insulin receptor IR-A, which is highly expressed in fetal tissues and responsive to IGF2, is also a member of the IGF-signaling system.\n\n【52】In many cancers, including those of the breast and ovary, dysregulation of this fetal form of the insulin receptor becomes the predominant isoform leading to IGF2-stimulated proliferation and survival.\n\n【53】Elevated insulin receptor content in human breast cancer.\n\n【54】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【55】INVASION\n--------\n\n【56】The sine qua non of both a successful pregnancy and the growth of cancer is the establishment of a blood and nutrient supply, and invasion through normal tissues is required for this process. However, whereas cancer cells spread throughout the host and then engage in local proliferation, trophoblasts follow an organized pattern of differentiation from proliferation to invasion without distant metastasis.\n\n【57】Some of the molecular switches involved in this differentiation pattern and their relevance for cancer therapeutic agents are discussed in the sections that follow.\n\n【58】As EVT cells migrate down the cytotrophoblast cell columns into the maternal decidua , they encircle and erode into the maternal spiral arteries and differentiate from a proliferative phenotype into an invasive phenotype.\n\n【59】This differentiation occurs at about 10 to 12 weeks of gestation and is associated with opening of the intervillous space and exposure to maternal blood. Many parallels can be observed between invasive EVT cells and cancer cells. Some of these similarities are highlighted in the sections to follow; for a more in-depth discussion, readers should refer to excellent reviews by Soundararajan and Rao\n\n【60】and Ferretti et al.\n\n【61】Requirements for cellular invasion include changes in cell adhesion molecules, secretion of proteases, and availability of growth factors. An example of a cellular program used by both cancer cells\n\n【62】and trophoblast cells\n\n【63】to promote invasion is epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which results in loss of cell-to-cell contact inhibition. Associated with this program are changes in integrin expression and loss of E cadherin, allowing loss of polarity and enhanced motility.\n\n【64】Localization of E-cadherin in villous, extravillous and vascular trophoblasts during intrauterine, ectopic and molar pregnancy.\n\n【65】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【66】Expression of E-cadherin and its repressor snail in placental tissue of normal, preeclamptic and HELLP pregnancies.\n\n【67】Both trophoblast and cancer cells secrete proteases to degrade extracellular matrix proteins required for dispersal through tissues. The cytoplasm of migratory EVT cells express HSP27, which is correlated with MMP2 activity.\n\n【68】Basal HSP27 levels are unusually high in cancer cells, protecting them from apoptotic stimuli,\n\n【69】and are associated with metastatic potential.\n\n【70】Finally, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor stimulate motility of EVT cells through phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAPKs and the PI3K-dependent proteins, AKT and p38.\n\n【71】Epidermal growth factor-stimulated extravillous cytotrophoblast motility is mediated by the activation of PI3-K, Akt and both p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases.\n\n【72】Epidermal growth factor is associated with tumor cell invasiveness through expression of MMPs.\n\n【73】Switches involved in triggering trophoblast and cancer cell molecular programs for invasion are not completely understood. The Wnt pathway, a system highly conserved across species involved in cellular proliferation and motility, has recently been implicated in switching trophoblast cells from a proliferative to an invasive phenotype.\n\n【74】Activation of the canonical wingless/T-cell factor signaling pathway promotes invasive differentiation of human trophoblast.\n\n【75】Activation of the Wnt pathway is aberrant in many cancers, resulting in escape of β-catenin from proteosomal degradation, with subsequent β-catenin translocation into the cell nucleus and activation of multiple target genes.\n\n【76】Although direct activation of β-catenin alone has shown no effect on motility of EVT cells, inhibition of the Wnt—β-catenin pathway can block blastocyst implantation.\n\n【77】Inactivation of nuclear Wnt-β-catenin signaling limits blastocyst competency for implantation.\n\n【78】In EVT cells, activation of PAR1 (also known as the thrombin receptor) also stabilizes β-catenin and is associated with a proliferative and invasive capacity, whereas application of PAR1-silencing RNA inhibits EVT invasion.\n\n【79】Consistent with the need for tight regulation of invasive trophoblast cells, PAR1 is expressed in EVT cells between the 7th and 10th gestational week but is abruptly shut off by the 12th week.\n\n【80】The pattern of expression of protease-activated receptors (PARs) during early trophoblast development.\n\n【81】Constitutive increased expression of PAR1 can be seen in cancer cells, especially in cells lacking normal p53 activity.\n\n【82】p53 controls hPar1 function and expression.\n\n【83】In vitro assays have shown PAR1 antagonism to inhibit MMP1-induced endothelial cell activation in tumor—endothelial cell communication.\n\n【84】Tumor-derived matrix metalloproteinase-1 targets endothelial proteinase-activated receptor 1 promoting endothelial cell activation.\n\n【85】Whether this system could successfully be targeted for cancer therapy is under investigation. Other signal transduction pathways common in both trophoblast and cancer cell invasion include the JAK-STAT pathway,\n\n【86】FAKs, G proteins, Rho-associated kinase, MAPKs, PI3K, and SMAD family proteins.\n\n【87】All of these pathways represent areas of current anticancer therapeutic development.\n\n【88】As EVTs acquire an invasive phenotype during placental development, they become polyploid (4N-8N) by switching from mitotic division to endoreduplication,\n\n【89】a process in which G2 or M phase (4N) cells replicate DNA without undergoing mitosis. In trophoblast cell lines, polyploid trophoblast giant cells are relatively resistant to the DNA-damaging effects of radiation,\n\n【90】illustrating a mechanism by which survival is promoted in invasive trophoblast cells. This process can also be observed in cancer cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. Endoreduplication can be induced in tumor cells on exposure to genotoxic agents such as paclitaxel\n\n【91】Cell cycle checkpoint efficiency and cellular response to paclitaxel in prostate cancer cells.\n\n【92】and cisplatin; a nonproliferative, senescent state in a small population of cells is induced in the latter case. The polyploid tumor cells can undergo depolyploidization to form diploid, cisplatin-resistant escape cells.\n\n【93】Tumor cells can escape DNA-damaging cisplatin through DNA endoreduplication and reversible polyploidy.\n\n【94】In cells with an impaired p53 system, treatment with the Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 leads to endoreduplication followed by apoptosis.\n\n【95】However, in 2 wild-type p53 cancer cell lines, stabilization of p53 by Nutlin-3a, an inhibitor of the p53-binding protein MDM2, leads to initial endoreduplication followed by the emergence of stable radiation- and cisplatin-resistant tetraploid clones.\n\n【96】A better understanding of the EVT endoreduplication process may lead to the development of targeted drugs to maintain tumor cell chemotherapeutic sensitivity.\n\n【97】VASCULOGENIC MIMICRY\n--------------------\n\n【98】As trophoblasts invade maternal spiral arteries, they further differentiate to display a vascular phenotype in a process termed _vasculogenic mimicry_ , in which cells other than endothelial cells form vascular structures.\n\n【99】Human cytotrophoblasts adopt a vascular phenotype as they differentiate: a strategy for successful endovascular invasion?\n\n【100】Vasculogenic mimicry can also be observed in aggressive cancers, and the genes and signaling pathways involved with the process of vasculogenic mimicry may be shared between EVT and cancer cells.\n\n【101】For example, the matrix glycoprotein—binding galectin 3 is highly expressed in EVT cells.\n\n【102】Galectin-3 also appears to be a key factor in the development of an endothelial phenotype and the tube formation well described in aggressive melanomas.\n\n【103】Galectin inhibitors are in preclinical testing as cancer therapeutic agents.\n\n【104】Synthetic inhibitors of galectin-1 and -3 selectively modulate homotypic cell aggregation and tumor cell apoptosis.\n\n【105】Mig-7 was found in circulating tumor cells and tumor tissue (regardless of tissue of origin) from more than 200 patients with cancer; notably, it was absent from healthy controls.\n\n【106】Mig-7 expression is associated with invasion and vasculogenic mimicry in cancer cells and also has recently been demonstrated in invasive embryonic cytotrophoblasts, peaking when EVT cells invade maternal decidua and remodel the vasculature during early placental development.\n\n【107】This finding represents the only known expression of Mig-7 in noncancerous cells. Cancers with an endothelial phenotype have not been shown to be responsive to antiangiogenic therapies.\n\n【108】Effects of angiogenesis inhibitors on vascular network formation by human endothelial and melanoma cells.\n\n【109】Because cancer therapy aimed at proliferating cells is less likely to be effective in invading cells,\n\n【110】galactin-3, Mig-7, and other pathways involved in vasculogenic mimicry may also be important targets for cancer therapy.\n\n【111】ANGIOGENESIS\n------------\n\n【112】Molecular circuits involved in neoangiogenesis separate from vasculogenic mimicry are also likely shared between EVT and tumor cells. Angiopoietins and VEGF family members are extremely important in both spiral artery remodeling in placentation\n\n【113】Localization of angiogenic growth factors and their receptors in the human placental bed throughout normal human pregnancy.\n\n【114】and the growth of many tumor types.\n\n【115】Inhibition of VEGF has become an important therapeutic strategy in many cancers, although resistance can develop,\n\n【116】resulting from the induction of an angiogenic rescue program characterized by the up-regulation of multiple angiogenic genes in hypoxic tumor cells and supporting stroma.\n\n【117】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【118】Anti-PlGF inhibits growth of VEGF(R)-inhibitor-resistant tumors without affecting healthy vessels.\n\n【119】Another member of the VEGF family, PGF, is a part of the VEGF blockade—associated rescue program that is involved in the response to pathologic conditions, such as wounds, ischemia, inflammation, or cancer.\n\n【120】Both VEGF and PGF are highly expressed in trophoblast cells.\n\n【121】It is interesting that serum levels of PGF increase after treatment of patients with cancer with the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab.\n\n【122】Surrogate markers for antiangiogenic therapy and dose-limiting toxicities for bevacizumab with radiation and chemotherapy: continued experience of a phase I trial in rectal cancer patients \\[letter\\].\n\n【123】Preclinical studies indicate that PGF blockade reduces neoangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, hampers recruitment of intratumoral macrophages, and is not associated with the typical anti-VEGF adverse effects (thrombosis, hypertension, proteinuria, and microvascular pruning) in healthy mice.\n\n【124】Anti-PlGF inhibits growth of VEGF(R)-inhibitor-resistant tumors without affecting healthy vessels.\n\n【125】Also important for angiogenesis is the oxygen-sensitive MTOR pathway.\n\n【126】Central to controlling trophoblast cell proliferation in response to nutrients and growth factors,\n\n【127】MTOR is expressed on the transporting epithelium of intact human placenta.\n\n【128】It is downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway; controls cell cycle progression and cell size and mass; is involved in angiogenesis via the VEGF, IGF, and HIF-1α—signaling pathways; and is constitutively activated in many malignancies.\n\n【129】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【130】The MTOR inhibitor everolimus has antiangiogenic properties.\n\n【131】mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) has antiangiogenic/vascular properties distinct from a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\n【132】A better understanding of the PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway and other molecular circuits used by trophoblast cells in proliferation, invasion, and endothelial interactions may lead to the development of targeted therapies for cancer.\n\n【133】Overall, we are in our infancy of understanding the complexity, redundancy, and interrelatedness of these molecular pathways in both placentation and neoplasia.\n\n【134】IMMUNOLOGIC PROPERTIES OF THE FETOMATERNAL INTERFACE AND TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【135】In addition to sharing many proliferative and invasive features, the cells of the trophoblast, like cancer cells, actively modulate the host immune response to develop and sustain a nutrient supply. Historically, the placenta was considered an inert, mechanical barrier protecting the semiallogeneic fetus from maternal immunologic attack.\n\n【136】Current evidence, however, supports just the opposite—many maternal and placental immunomodulatory factors are required for adequate placental invasion. Around 40% of decidual cells are cells of the innate immune system (eg, NK cells, macrophages, and DCs), a substantial proportion considering that the uterus is a nonlymphoid organ.\n\n【137】Likewise, although cancer previously has been considered immunologically invisible to the host, many recent studies support the notion that cancer cells actively engage immune cells; for example, the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has been well described in the literature.\n\n【138】The main components of the maternal immune response at the fetomaternal interface and the similarities to the tumor microenvironment are discussed in the sections that follow.\n\n【139】The most abundant immune cell present at the fetomaternal interface is the uterine NK (uNK) cell, which constitutes approximately 70% of all immune cells found in this tissue.\n\n【140】Recruitment of circulating NK cells through decidual tissues: a possible mechanism controlling NK cell accumulation in the uterus during early pregnancy.\n\n【141】Uterine NK cells are thought to be recruited from peripheral blood when interleukin (IL)-15 is secreted by endometrial stromal cells.\n\n【142】They are distinct from peripheral blood NK cells in that they do not express CD16, the FcRγIIIA receptor required for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\n【143】The mechanisms associated with this loss of CD16 are unclear but may be related to high levels of TGF-β within the microenvironment.\n\n【144】TGFβ promotes conversion of CD16 <sup>+ </sup> peripheral blood NK cells into CD16- NK cells with similarities to decidual NK cells.\n\n【145】Also, in contrast to peripheral blood NK cells, uNK cells are more immunomodulatory than cytotoxic, secreting galectin 1 to induce tolerogenic DCs\n\n【146】Human decidual natural killer cells are a unique NK cell subset with immunomodulatory potential.\n\n【147】as well as angiogenic factors VEGF and PGF that are important for decidual remodeling.\n\n【148】Decidual NK cells regulate key developmental processes at the human fetal-maternal interface.\n\n【149】An improper balance of cytotoxic to regulatory NK cells could contribute to recurrent miscarriage and pre-eclampsia.\n\n【150】Expression of IL-15 and NK cell infiltration have been reported in many different malignancies,\n\n【151】IFN-γ acts on T cells to induce NK cell mobilization and accumulation in target organs.\n\n【152】including renal cell carcinoma,\n\n【153】Membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-15 on renal tumor cells rescues natural killer cells from IL-2 starvation-induced apoptosis.\n\n【154】with variable prognostic implications. Recently, tumor-infiltrating CD16-NK cells have also been characterized and appear to behave similarly to uNK cells with respect to cytokine production and reduced cytotoxic activity.\n\n【155】Natural killer cells infiltrating human nonsmall-cell lung cancer are enriched in CD56 bright CD16 (-) cells and display an impaired capability to kill tumor cells.\n\n【156】A closer look at factors that determine the balance of killer and regulatory NK cells during pregnancy may help identify mechanisms that shift immunity toward NK cytotoxic activity in patients with cancer.\n\n【157】Also infiltrating the decidua, albeit in smaller numbers than uNK cells, are macrophages, T <sub>reg </sub> , and DCs. Macrophages phagocytose apoptotic EVT cells and secrete IL-10 and IDO, contributing to the tolerogenic T <sub>H </sub> 2 milieu.\n\n【158】Gene expression profiling of decidual macrophages supports an immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory phenotype with higher expression of _CCL18, IGF1, IDO_ , neuropilin 1, and other genes associated with M2-polarized macrophages.\n\n【159】Gene expression profiling of human decidual macrophages: evidence for immunosuppressive phenotype.\n\n【160】Tumor-associated macrophages can be both inflammatory and immunosuppressive, and T <sub>H </sub> 1/T <sub>H </sub> 2 polarization is effected through the activation of NF-κB (also known as NFKB1).\n\n【161】In fact, in vitro studies suggest that tumor-associated macrophages may be re-educated to display a classically activated rather than an M2 phenotype by inhibition of inhibitory kappa B kinase β, the major activator of NF-κB.\n\n【162】“Re-educating” tumor-associated macrophages by targeting NF-κB.\n\n【163】Regulatory T cells are additional important mediators of tolerance in both pregnancy and cancer. Immunophenotypically, these cells express surface CD4, CD25, and FOXP3, and they expand in both decidua\n\n【164】and peripheral blood\n\n【165】during normal pregnancies. This expansion is antigen-specific and is induced by paternal/fetal alloantigens\n\n【166】and not simply by hormonal changes in pregnancy.\n\n【167】Mechanisms of action of regulatory T cells specific for paternal antigens during pregnancy.\n\n【168】A decrease in this lymphocyte subset is associated with spontaneous abortion\n\n【169】and pre-eclampsia.\n\n【170】Distinct subsets of regulatory T cells during pregnancy: is the imbalance of these subsets involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia?\n\n【171】Regulatory T cells are also expanded in cancer and are implicated in impaired antitumor immunity,\n\n【172】suppression of effector T lymphocyte proliferation,\n\n【173】CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD25 <sup>+ </sup> CD127 (low/-) regulatory T cells express Foxp3 and suppress effector T cell proliferation and contribute to gastric cancers progression.\n\n【174】and increased tumor blood vessel density,\n\n【175】The presence of tumor-infiltrating FOXP3 <sup>+ </sup> lymphocytes correlates with intratumoral angiogenesis in endometrial cancer.\n\n【176】suggesting an important link between immunity and angiogenesis. Regulatory T cells in patients with cancer also recognize tumor-specific antigens and proliferate in response to antigenic stimulation.\n\n【177】Targeting the T <sub>reg </sub> population to boost antitumor immunity is under investigation with agents such as denileukin diftitox (IL2/diphtheria fusion protein) or LMB-2 (Fv fragment of CD25 antibody/ _Pseudomonas_ endotoxin A fusion protein) and CTLA-4 inhibitors.\n\n【178】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【179】Some of the benefit of cytotoxic chemotherapy may be derived from concomitant impairment of the immunosuppressive T <sub>reg </sub> proliferation driven by the cancer.\n\n【180】Antigen-presenting CD83 <sup>+ </sup> DCs are involved in the maintenance of the T <sub>H </sub> 2-predominant state in decidual tissues,\n\n【181】Predominance of Th2-promoting dendritic cells in early human pregnancy decidua.\n\n【182】as well as at other mucosal surfaces.\n\n【183】Human decidua contains potent immunostimulatory CD83 <sup>+ </sup> dendritic cells.\n\n【184】However, the role of the DC is likely more complex than antigen presentation and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. Ablation of uterine DCs leads to decidualization failure and embryo resorption in mice; this occurs even with syngeneic pregnancy in mice in which alloantigens are absent.\n\n【185】Uterine DCs are crucial for decidua formation during embryo implantation in mice.\n\n【186】Dendritic cells also represent another link between immunity and angiogenesis, secreting soluble FLT1 (also known as VEGFR1) and TGF-β1 required for endothelial cell survival and vascular maturation. In the absence of DCs, angiogenesis is severely impaired. In cancer, DCs also play a role that is more than immunoregulatory through their production of potent angiogenic growth factors. Moreover, cancer cells can secrete substances that suppress maturation of DCs, including VEGF, TGF-β, hepatocyte growth factor, and osteopontin, thereby maintaining a proangiogenic, immature DC phenotype.\n\n【187】Expression of certain cell surface molecules on both trophoblast and cancer cells can also confer immunologic protection. Among the most important of these molecules is the nonpolymorphic, highly conserved class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules such as HLAG\n\n【188】 in contrast, the highly diverse classical HLA class I proteins A, B, and C are essential in cell-mediated immune responses. In fact, in trophoblast cells, interferon-γ fails to stimulate classical HLA class I expression.\n\n【189】A similar property of down-regulated or absent classical HLA class I expression can cloak cancer cells from the host's immune system.\n\n【190】Cancer treatment modalities including gamma irradiation,\n\n【191】Gamma-radiation upregulates MHC class I/II and ICAM-I molecules in multiple myeloma cell lines and primary tumors.\n\n【192】radiopharmaceutical samarium-153-ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate,\n\n【193】The use of chelated radionuclide (samarium-153-ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate) to modulate phenotype of tumor cells and enhance T cell-mediated killing.\n\n【194】and chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil\n\n【195】5-fluorouracil derivatives induce differentiation mediated by tubulin and HLA class I modulation.\n\n【196】and hypomethylating agents\n\n【197】Functional up-regulation of human leukocyte antigen class I antigens expression by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine in cutaneous melanoma: immunotherapeutic implications.\n\n【198】increase HLA class I expression.\n\n【199】Expression of HLAG on trophoblast cells and cancer cells has important immunomodulatory effects. In the placenta, HLAG expression is most evident on EVTs at the fetomaternal interface, with lower expression at the proliferative area of the villous column and increased expression with invasive, interstitial, and endovascular EVT cells.\n\n【200】Human placental HLA-G expression is restricted to differentiated cytotrophoblasts.\n\n【201】On the basis of sequence homologies, _HLAG_ has been proposed as the ancestral MHC class I gene and has only a few known sequence variations in humans, in sharp contrast to the profound allelic diversity (measured in the hundreds of allelic variants) of classical MHC class I genes.\n\n【202】Evolution of MHC-G in primates: a different kind of molecule for each group of species.\n\n【203】Human leukocyte antigen-G interacts with NK cells via inhibitory receptors, such as CD94/NKG2A, ILT2, and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor KIR2DL4.\n\n【204】The role of HLAG is to suppress cytolytic killing by both NK and cytotoxic T cells, induce apoptosis of immune cells, regulate cytokine production in blood mononuclear cells, and reduce stimulatory capacity and impair maturation of DCs (reviewed in Hunt et al\n\n【205】). Within the tumor microenvironment, the generation of HLAG <sup>+ </sup> —suppressive NK cells occurs by trogocytosis (ie, the rapid cell-to-cell contact-dependent transfer of membranes and associated molecules from one cell to another), leading to the inhibition of other HLAG <sup>+ </sup> (cross-inhibition) or HLAG <sup>− </sup> NK cells through HLAG and ILT2 cross-linking.\n\n【206】Trogocytosis-based generation of suppressive NK cells.\n\n【207】Expression of HLAG is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders,\n\n【208】HLA-G and lymphoproliferative disorders.\n\n【209】melanoma,\n\n【210】Quantitative HLA-G expression in metastasising and non-metastasising primary thin cutaneous melanomas \\[letter\\].\n\n【211】mesothelioma,\n\n【212】Expression of HLA-G in malignant mesothelioma and clinically aggressive breast carcinoma.\n\n【213】breast carcinoma,\n\n【214】Expression of HLA-G in malignant mesothelioma and clinically aggressive breast carcinoma.\n\n【215】ovarian carcinoma,\n\n【216】HLA-G expression in effusions is a possible marker of tumor susceptibility to chemotherapy in ovarian carcinoma.\n\n【217】renal cell carcinoma,\n\n【218】squamous esophageal cancer,\n\n【219】gastric carcinoma,\n\n【220】cervical cancer,\n\n【221】non—small cell lung cancer,\n\n【222】bladder cancer,\n\n【223】Expression of HLA-G in cancer bladder.\n\n【224】prostate cancer,\n\n【225】endometrial cancer,\n\n【226】colorectal cancer,\n\n【227】and myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n【228】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【229】Unfavourable clinical implications for HLA-G expression in acute myeloid leukaemia.\n\n【230】However, relatively little is known about the regulation of the expression of this important immunomodulatory molecule.\n\n【231】Regulation of HLAG expression may be at the epigenetic level, with transcription of HLAG being detectable in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine.\n\n【232】Some preliminary evidence also supports a micro-RNA regulatory mechanism.\n\n【233】Clearly, HLAG represents an attractive target for immune-based cancer therapies given its preferential expression in many malignancies as well as limited expression in normal tissues.\n\n【234】The HLA-G gene is expressed at a low mRNA level in different human cells and tissues.\n\n【235】Targeting HLAG with a peptide-based vaccine strategy to develop a cytotoxic T-cell response against tumor cells bearing the molecule has proved feasible,\n\n【236】HLA-G as a target molecule in specific immunotherapy against renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【237】although much work remains before other methods of HLAG inhibition could lead to restoration of antitumor immunity.\n\n【238】Other cell surface tolerance signals common between trophoblasts and cancer cells include CD200 (OX-2) and CEACAM-1.

We have also verified that these immunomodulatory genes are differentially expressed in melanoma vs benign melanocytic nevi in 2 independent publically available datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information/GenBank GEO database: GSE4587,\n\n【371】which was analyzed on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and GSE3189,\n\n【372】Novel genes associated with malignant melanoma but not benign melanocytic lesions.\n\n【373】which was analyzed on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Array Set HG-U133A platform (Affymetrix).

A summary of results is listed in Table 2 . Osteopontin and other important components of innate immunity such as _TLR2_ and _TLR4_ and _PTX3_ were significantly up-regulated in melanoma compared with benign nevi. Galectins 1 and 9 were also significantly up-regulated compared with nevi.

Overall, this pattern is supportive of our theory that tumor cells use similar mechanisms of immune escape as those cells of the developing placenta, although these similarities have not yet been studied in a systematic fashion. Given what we have learned about the similarities between the placenta and tumor microenvironment, we plan to next comprehensively evaluate changes in systemic immune homeostasis in pregnancy vs cancer in order to prioritize potential therapeutic targets. In particular, identifying immunologic distinctions between pregnancy and cancer will be critical for this process.\n\n【378】TABLE 2 Immunomodulatory Genes Differentially Expressed in Melanoma vs Benign Melanocytic Lesions\n\n【379】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【380】IL-8 = interleukin 8.

The challenge for investigators in this field will be to extend our observations beyond the T <sub>H </sub> 1/T <sub>H </sub> 2 paradigm in both pregnancy and cancer to a model that can both assess the status and guide treatment of malignancies in an individualized, rational, real-time manner. A critical need exists for the development of treatments aimed at all aspects of cancer: malignant proliferation, invasion, vasculogenic mimicry, angiogenesis, and immune privilege. Studying how all these aspects are orchestrated in the predictable, physiologic process of pregnancy can facilitate the search for novel cancer treatment strategies, from cytotoxic chemotherapy to biologic agents and immunologic adjuncts, in the often unpredictable and arduous fight against the pathologic process of cancer.\n\n【386】### Glossary of Genetics Terminology\n\n【387】_AKT_\n\n【388】v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog\n\n【389】_ALK_\n\n【390】anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase\n\n【391】_BCL2_\n\n【392】B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2\n\n【393】_CDK_\n\n【394】cyclin dependent kinase\n\n【395】_CEACAM1_\n\n【396】carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (biliary glycoprotein)\n\n【397】_CMET_ (also known as _MET_ )\n\n【398】met proto-oncogene (hepatocyte growth factor) receptor\n\n【399】_CSF_\n\n【400】colony-stimulating factor\n\n【401】_CSF1R_\n\n【402】CSF type 1 receptor\n\n【403】_CXCR4_\n\n【404】chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4\n\n【405】_EGF_\n\n【406】epidermal growth factor (beta-urogastrone)\n\n【407】_ERK_\n\n【408】extracellular signal—related kinase\n\n【409】_FABP4_\n\n【410】fatty acid—binding protein 4\n\n【411】_FAK_\n\n【412】focal adhesion kinase\n\n【413】_FAS_\n\n【414】Fas (TNF receptor superfamily, member 6)\n\n【415】_FASL_\n\n【416】FAS ligand\n\n【417】_FCγIIIA_\n\n【418】FC gamma receptor III A\n\n【419】_FGF_\n\n【420】fibroblast growth factor\n\n【421】_FLT1_\n\n【422】fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor receptor)\n\n【423】_FOXP3_\n\n【424】forkhead box P3\n\n【425】_FZD10_\n\n【426】frizzled homolog 10\n\n【427】_GRO-α_\n\n【428】growth-related oncogene α\n\n【429】_HGF_\n\n【430】hepatocyte growth factor\n\n【431】_HIF-1α_\n\n【432】hypoxia inducible factor 1α\n\n【433】_HSP27_\n\n【434】heat shock protein 27\n\n【435】_IDO_\n\n【436】indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase\n\n【437】_IGF_\n\n【438】insulinlike growth factor\n\n【439】_IGF1R_\n\n【440】IGF type 1 receptor\n\n【441】_ILT2_\n\n【442】Ig-like transcript 2\n\n【443】_JAK_\n\n【444】janus kinase\n\n【445】_LGALS_ 1\n\n【446】galactin 1\n\n【447】_LGALS_ 9\n\n【448】galactin 9\n\n【449】_LPL_\n\n【450】lipoprotein lipase\n\n【451】_MAPK_\n\n【452】mitogen-activated protein kinase\n\n【453】_MCP_ 1\n\n【454】monocyte chemoattractant protein 1\n\n【455】_MEK_ (also known as _MAP2K_ )\n\n【456】MAPK/ERK kinase\n\n【457】_MIF_\n\n【458】macrophage migration inhibitory factor\n\n【459】_Mig-_ 7\n\n【460】migration-induction protein 7\n\n【461】_MDM_ 2\n\n【462】mouse double minute 2\n\n【463】_MMP_\n\n【464】matrix metalloproteinase\n\n【465】_MTOR_\n\n【466】mammalian target of rapamycin\n\n【467】_MUC1_\n\n【468】mucin 1\n\n【469】_NF-κB_\n\n【470】nuclear factor κB\n\n【471】_p38_\n\n【472】tumor protein 38\n\n【473】_PAR1_\n\n【474】protease activated receptor 1\n\n【475】_PDGF_\n\n【476】platelet-derived growth factor\n\n【477】_PDGFR_\n\n【478】PDGF receptor\n\n【479】_PEDF_\n\n【480】pigment epithelial—derived factor\n\n【481】_PGE2_\n\n【482】prostaglandin E2\n\n【483】_PGF_\n\n【484】placental growth factor\n\n【485】_PI3K_\n\n【486】phosphoinositide-3 kinase\n\n【487】_PSG1_\n\n【488】pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1\n\n【489】_PTX3_\n\n【490】pentraxin 3\n\n【491】_RANTES_ (also known as _CCL5_ )\n\n【492】regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted\n\n【493】_RAF_\n\n【494】v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1\n\n【495】_RAS_\n\n【496】rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog\n\n【497】_SDF_ (also known as _CXCL12_ )\n\n【498】stromal-derived factor 1\n\n【499】_SPP1_\n\n【500】osteopontin\n\n【501】_STAT_\n\n【502】signal transducers and activator of transcription\n\n【503】_TGF_\n\n【504】transforming growth factor\n\n【505】_TIM3_ (also known as _HAVCR2_ )\n\n【506】T cell immunoglobulin mucin 3\n\n【507】_TIMP2_\n\n【508】tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2\n\n【509】_TLR_\n\n【510】toll-like receptor\n\n【511】_TNF_\n\n【512】tumor necrosis factor\n\n【513】_TRAIL_\n\n【514】TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand\n\n【515】_TRAILR_\n\n【516】TRAIL receptor\n\n【517】_uPA_\n\n【518】urokinase plasminogen activator\n\n【519】_VEGF_\n\n【520】vascular endothelial growth factor\n\n【521】_VEGFR_\n\n【522】VEGF receptor\n\n【523】_waf1/cip1_ (also known as _CDKN1A_ )\n\n【524】cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A\n\n【525】_Wnt_\n\n【526】wingless/T-cell factor\n\n【527】_XIAP_\n\n【528】X-link inhibitor of apoptosis protein\n\n【529】Author Interview\n----------------\n\n【530】Interview with Dr. Shernan Holtan", "index": 6636, "show": true, "start": 6636, "end": 6734, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【24】a HLA = human leukocyte antigen.

In addition to the shared capacity for invading through normal tissues, both cancer cells and cells of the developing placenta create a microenvironment supportive of both immunologic privilege and angiogenesis. Systemic alterations in immunity are also detectable, particularly with respect to a helper T cell type 2 polarization evident in advanced cancers and midtrimester pregnancy. This review summarizes the similarities between growth and immune privilege in cancer and pregnancy and identifies areas for further investigation. Our PubMed search strategy included combinations of terms such as _immune tolerance, pregnancy, cancer, cytokines, angiogenesis_ , and _invasion_ .

The knowledge gained from analyzing similarities and differences between the physiologic state of pregnancy and the pathologic state of cancer could lead to identification of new potential targets for cancer therapeutic agents.\n\n【1】CTL ( CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte ), DC ( dendritic cell ), EVT ( extravillous trophoblast ), HLA ( human leukocyte antigen ), IL ( interleukin ), NK ( natural killer ), TH1 ( helper T cell type 1 ), TH2 ( helper T cell type 2 ), Treg ( regulatory T cell ), uNK ( uterine NK )\n\n【2】A substantial body of literature exists describing the mechanisms cancer cells use to escape apoptosis and migrate through normal structures while evading a host immune response. What is not well known, however, is how these complex and interrelated mechanisms are orchestrated, starting with modulation of the immune response within the tumor microenvironment and ending with migration and proliferation of cancer cells at distant sites. One potential model to further study how a single malignant cell could proliferate and then metastasize undetected within a host is that of normal human pregnancy, in which the developing placenta invades the uterus and a semiallogeneic fetus escapes rejection from the maternal immune system.\n\n【3】A multitude of immunomodulatory properties of the fetomaternal interface (placenta) have evolved to allow the survival of the immunologically distinct fetus to parturition without an attack from the maternal immune system. The similarities between the mechanisms involved in fetomaternal and tumor-associated immunologic tolerance are intriguing and suggest a common pattern; however, neither system of immune evasion is perfect. A clear example of placental failure to protect the fetus against maternal immunity is that of Rh incompatibility. In multiparous women sensitized against fetal Rh antigens, re-exposure to fetal Rh antigens with subsequent pregnancy may lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn and fetal death.\n\n【4】Such imperfections of shared mechanisms of immune tolerance between pregnancy and cancer suggest that cancer rejection via immunologic means may be possible, even considering the myriad mechanisms extending immunologic privilege to the fetus as well as cancer cells.\n\n【5】This review summarizes the parallels in proliferation, invasion, and immune privilege between cancer and pregnancy by first detailing shared characteristics of fetal-derived trophoblast cells of the placenta and tumor cells. It then describes the similarities between tolerogenic systems within the tumor microenvironment and the fetomaternal interface. Finally, it provides an overview of the evidence for systemic immune modulation in cancer and pregnancy and suggests the implications of these similarities in designing an integrated approach to cancer therapy. Our PubMed search strategy included combinations of terms such as _immune tolerance, pregnancy, cancer, cytokines, angiogenesis_ , and _invasion_ . We also searched for articles on cellular subsets, including natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory T cells (T <sub>reg </sub> ), and other lymphocyte populations with respect to their presence and function in pregnancy and cancer. We did not place any restrictions on publication dates. A better understanding of how the maternal immune system is altered during the normal processes of implantation, gestation, and labor may translate into individualized, novel therapies aimed at restoring immune competency in patients with advanced malignancies.\n\n【6】SHARED CHARACTERISTICS OF TROPHOBLAST CELLS AND TUMOR CELLS\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Five days after fertilization, the human zygote forms into a structure consisting of 2 primary cell lines: the inner cellmass (or embryoblast) and the trophoblast.\n\n【8】Trophoblast cells constitute the outer layer of the blastocyst, rapidly proliferating and invading the maternal endometrial decidua around day 7. A monolayer of cytotrophoblast cells surrounds the embryonic disc as the embryo completely embeds beneath the uterine decidua. By day 9, cytotrophoblast cells have differentiated into 2 distinct cell types: the syncytiotrophoblast and the extravillous trophoblast (EVT). The multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast cells form the external layer and are terminally differentiated. These cells are involved in fetomaternal nutrient exchanges and endocrine functions (such as β-human chorionic gonadotropic production). In contrast, EVT cells have a proliferative and invasive phenotype, migrating through the syncytiotrophoblast into the uterine wall to anchor the placenta beginning around day 14 after implantation.\n\n【9】These EVT cells display a phenotype strikingly similar to cancer cells with their capacity for proliferation, migration, and establishment of a blood supply, making them a compelling model for oncologic comparison . This review highlights several shared characteristics of trophoblast and tumor cells and discusses them in the context of existing or developmental targeted cancer therapeutics .\n\n【10】FIGURE Similarities between the fetomaternal interface and tumor microenvironment.

By binding to the IGF1R on cytotrophoblast cells, IGF stimulates proliferation through the MAPK pathway and survival via activation of the PI3K pathway.\n\n【48】Normally, levels of IGF are tightly regulated by IGF-binding proteins and protease pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, a binding protein.\n\n【49】Loss of binding protein regulation may contribute to the malignant phenotype.\n\n【50】In cancer cells, the IGF1R pathway is not only mitogenic and antiapoptotic but is involved in protecting cancer cells from damaging effects of chemotherapy and radiation, potentially as a result of its effects on downstream signaling pathways.\n\n【51】Additionally, the fetal form of the insulin receptor IR-A, which is highly expressed in fetal tissues and responsive to IGF2, is also a member of the IGF-signaling system.\n\n【52】In many cancers, including those of the breast and ovary, dysregulation of this fetal form of the insulin receptor becomes the predominant isoform leading to IGF2-stimulated proliferation and survival.\n\n【53】Elevated insulin receptor content in human breast cancer.\n\n【54】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【55】INVASION\n--------\n\n【56】The sine qua non of both a successful pregnancy and the growth of cancer is the establishment of a blood and nutrient supply, and invasion through normal tissues is required for this process. However, whereas cancer cells spread throughout the host and then engage in local proliferation, trophoblasts follow an organized pattern of differentiation from proliferation to invasion without distant metastasis.\n\n【57】Some of the molecular switches involved in this differentiation pattern and their relevance for cancer therapeutic agents are discussed in the sections that follow.\n\n【58】As EVT cells migrate down the cytotrophoblast cell columns into the maternal decidua , they encircle and erode into the maternal spiral arteries and differentiate from a proliferative phenotype into an invasive phenotype.\n\n【59】This differentiation occurs at about 10 to 12 weeks of gestation and is associated with opening of the intervillous space and exposure to maternal blood. Many parallels can be observed between invasive EVT cells and cancer cells. Some of these similarities are highlighted in the sections to follow; for a more in-depth discussion, readers should refer to excellent reviews by Soundararajan and Rao\n\n【60】and Ferretti et al.\n\n【61】Requirements for cellular invasion include changes in cell adhesion molecules, secretion of proteases, and availability of growth factors. An example of a cellular program used by both cancer cells\n\n【62】and trophoblast cells\n\n【63】to promote invasion is epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which results in loss of cell-to-cell contact inhibition. Associated with this program are changes in integrin expression and loss of E cadherin, allowing loss of polarity and enhanced motility.\n\n【64】Localization of E-cadherin in villous, extravillous and vascular trophoblasts during intrauterine, ectopic and molar pregnancy.\n\n【65】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【66】Expression of E-cadherin and its repressor snail in placental tissue of normal, preeclamptic and HELLP pregnancies.\n\n【67】Both trophoblast and cancer cells secrete proteases to degrade extracellular matrix proteins required for dispersal through tissues. The cytoplasm of migratory EVT cells express HSP27, which is correlated with MMP2 activity.\n\n【68】Basal HSP27 levels are unusually high in cancer cells, protecting them from apoptotic stimuli,\n\n【69】and are associated with metastatic potential.\n\n【70】Finally, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor stimulate motility of EVT cells through phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAPKs and the PI3K-dependent proteins, AKT and p38.\n\n【71】Epidermal growth factor-stimulated extravillous cytotrophoblast motility is mediated by the activation of PI3-K, Akt and both p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases.\n\n【72】Epidermal growth factor is associated with tumor cell invasiveness through expression of MMPs.\n\n【73】Switches involved in triggering trophoblast and cancer cell molecular programs for invasion are not completely understood. The Wnt pathway, a system highly conserved across species involved in cellular proliferation and motility, has recently been implicated in switching trophoblast cells from a proliferative to an invasive phenotype.\n\n【74】Activation of the canonical wingless/T-cell factor signaling pathway promotes invasive differentiation of human trophoblast.\n\n【75】Activation of the Wnt pathway is aberrant in many cancers, resulting in escape of β-catenin from proteosomal degradation, with subsequent β-catenin translocation into the cell nucleus and activation of multiple target genes.\n\n【76】Although direct activation of β-catenin alone has shown no effect on motility of EVT cells, inhibition of the Wnt—β-catenin pathway can block blastocyst implantation.\n\n【77】Inactivation of nuclear Wnt-β-catenin signaling limits blastocyst competency for implantation.\n\n【78】In EVT cells, activation of PAR1 (also known as the thrombin receptor) also stabilizes β-catenin and is associated with a proliferative and invasive capacity, whereas application of PAR1-silencing RNA inhibits EVT invasion.\n\n【79】Consistent with the need for tight regulation of invasive trophoblast cells, PAR1 is expressed in EVT cells between the 7th and 10th gestational week but is abruptly shut off by the 12th week.\n\n【80】The pattern of expression of protease-activated receptors (PARs) during early trophoblast development.\n\n【81】Constitutive increased expression of PAR1 can be seen in cancer cells, especially in cells lacking normal p53 activity.\n\n【82】p53 controls hPar1 function and expression.\n\n【83】In vitro assays have shown PAR1 antagonism to inhibit MMP1-induced endothelial cell activation in tumor—endothelial cell communication.\n\n【84】Tumor-derived matrix metalloproteinase-1 targets endothelial proteinase-activated receptor 1 promoting endothelial cell activation.\n\n【85】Whether this system could successfully be targeted for cancer therapy is under investigation. Other signal transduction pathways common in both trophoblast and cancer cell invasion include the JAK-STAT pathway,\n\n【86】FAKs, G proteins, Rho-associated kinase, MAPKs, PI3K, and SMAD family proteins.\n\n【87】All of these pathways represent areas of current anticancer therapeutic development.\n\n【88】As EVTs acquire an invasive phenotype during placental development, they become polyploid (4N-8N) by switching from mitotic division to endoreduplication,\n\n【89】a process in which G2 or M phase (4N) cells replicate DNA without undergoing mitosis. In trophoblast cell lines, polyploid trophoblast giant cells are relatively resistant to the DNA-damaging effects of radiation,\n\n【90】illustrating a mechanism by which survival is promoted in invasive trophoblast cells. This process can also be observed in cancer cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. Endoreduplication can be induced in tumor cells on exposure to genotoxic agents such as paclitaxel\n\n【91】Cell cycle checkpoint efficiency and cellular response to paclitaxel in prostate cancer cells.\n\n【92】and cisplatin; a nonproliferative, senescent state in a small population of cells is induced in the latter case. The polyploid tumor cells can undergo depolyploidization to form diploid, cisplatin-resistant escape cells.\n\n【93】Tumor cells can escape DNA-damaging cisplatin through DNA endoreduplication and reversible polyploidy.\n\n【94】In cells with an impaired p53 system, treatment with the Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 leads to endoreduplication followed by apoptosis.\n\n【95】However, in 2 wild-type p53 cancer cell lines, stabilization of p53 by Nutlin-3a, an inhibitor of the p53-binding protein MDM2, leads to initial endoreduplication followed by the emergence of stable radiation- and cisplatin-resistant tetraploid clones.\n\n【96】A better understanding of the EVT endoreduplication process may lead to the development of targeted drugs to maintain tumor cell chemotherapeutic sensitivity.\n\n【97】VASCULOGENIC MIMICRY\n--------------------\n\n【98】As trophoblasts invade maternal spiral arteries, they further differentiate to display a vascular phenotype in a process termed _vasculogenic mimicry_ , in which cells other than endothelial cells form vascular structures.\n\n【99】Human cytotrophoblasts adopt a vascular phenotype as they differentiate: a strategy for successful endovascular invasion?\n\n【100】Vasculogenic mimicry can also be observed in aggressive cancers, and the genes and signaling pathways involved with the process of vasculogenic mimicry may be shared between EVT and cancer cells.\n\n【101】For example, the matrix glycoprotein—binding galectin 3 is highly expressed in EVT cells.\n\n【102】Galectin-3 also appears to be a key factor in the development of an endothelial phenotype and the tube formation well described in aggressive melanomas.\n\n【103】Galectin inhibitors are in preclinical testing as cancer therapeutic agents.\n\n【104】Synthetic inhibitors of galectin-1 and -3 selectively modulate homotypic cell aggregation and tumor cell apoptosis.\n\n【105】Mig-7 was found in circulating tumor cells and tumor tissue (regardless of tissue of origin) from more than 200 patients with cancer; notably, it was absent from healthy controls.\n\n【106】Mig-7 expression is associated with invasion and vasculogenic mimicry in cancer cells and also has recently been demonstrated in invasive embryonic cytotrophoblasts, peaking when EVT cells invade maternal decidua and remodel the vasculature during early placental development.\n\n【107】This finding represents the only known expression of Mig-7 in noncancerous cells. Cancers with an endothelial phenotype have not been shown to be responsive to antiangiogenic therapies.\n\n【108】Effects of angiogenesis inhibitors on vascular network formation by human endothelial and melanoma cells.\n\n【109】Because cancer therapy aimed at proliferating cells is less likely to be effective in invading cells,\n\n【110】galactin-3, Mig-7, and other pathways involved in vasculogenic mimicry may also be important targets for cancer therapy.\n\n【111】ANGIOGENESIS\n------------\n\n【112】Molecular circuits involved in neoangiogenesis separate from vasculogenic mimicry are also likely shared between EVT and tumor cells. Angiopoietins and VEGF family members are extremely important in both spiral artery remodeling in placentation\n\n【113】Localization of angiogenic growth factors and their receptors in the human placental bed throughout normal human pregnancy.\n\n【114】and the growth of many tumor types.\n\n【115】Inhibition of VEGF has become an important therapeutic strategy in many cancers, although resistance can develop,\n\n【116】resulting from the induction of an angiogenic rescue program characterized by the up-regulation of multiple angiogenic genes in hypoxic tumor cells and supporting stroma.\n\n【117】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【118】Anti-PlGF inhibits growth of VEGF(R)-inhibitor-resistant tumors without affecting healthy vessels.\n\n【119】Another member of the VEGF family, PGF, is a part of the VEGF blockade—associated rescue program that is involved in the response to pathologic conditions, such as wounds, ischemia, inflammation, or cancer.\n\n【120】Both VEGF and PGF are highly expressed in trophoblast cells.\n\n【121】It is interesting that serum levels of PGF increase after treatment of patients with cancer with the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab.\n\n【122】Surrogate markers for antiangiogenic therapy and dose-limiting toxicities for bevacizumab with radiation and chemotherapy: continued experience of a phase I trial in rectal cancer patients \\[letter\\].\n\n【123】Preclinical studies indicate that PGF blockade reduces neoangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, hampers recruitment of intratumoral macrophages, and is not associated with the typical anti-VEGF adverse effects (thrombosis, hypertension, proteinuria, and microvascular pruning) in healthy mice.\n\n【124】Anti-PlGF inhibits growth of VEGF(R)-inhibitor-resistant tumors without affecting healthy vessels.\n\n【125】Also important for angiogenesis is the oxygen-sensitive MTOR pathway.\n\n【126】Central to controlling trophoblast cell proliferation in response to nutrients and growth factors,\n\n【127】MTOR is expressed on the transporting epithelium of intact human placenta.\n\n【128】It is downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway; controls cell cycle progression and cell size and mass; is involved in angiogenesis via the VEGF, IGF, and HIF-1α—signaling pathways; and is constitutively activated in many malignancies.\n\n【129】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【130】The MTOR inhibitor everolimus has antiangiogenic properties.\n\n【131】mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) has antiangiogenic/vascular properties distinct from a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\n【132】A better understanding of the PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway and other molecular circuits used by trophoblast cells in proliferation, invasion, and endothelial interactions may lead to the development of targeted therapies for cancer.\n\n【133】Overall, we are in our infancy of understanding the complexity, redundancy, and interrelatedness of these molecular pathways in both placentation and neoplasia.\n\n【134】IMMUNOLOGIC PROPERTIES OF THE FETOMATERNAL INTERFACE AND TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【135】In addition to sharing many proliferative and invasive features, the cells of the trophoblast, like cancer cells, actively modulate the host immune response to develop and sustain a nutrient supply. Historically, the placenta was considered an inert, mechanical barrier protecting the semiallogeneic fetus from maternal immunologic attack.\n\n【136】Current evidence, however, supports just the opposite—many maternal and placental immunomodulatory factors are required for adequate placental invasion. Around 40% of decidual cells are cells of the innate immune system (eg, NK cells, macrophages, and DCs), a substantial proportion considering that the uterus is a nonlymphoid organ.\n\n【137】Likewise, although cancer previously has been considered immunologically invisible to the host, many recent studies support the notion that cancer cells actively engage immune cells; for example, the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has been well described in the literature.\n\n【138】The main components of the maternal immune response at the fetomaternal interface and the similarities to the tumor microenvironment are discussed in the sections that follow.\n\n【139】The most abundant immune cell present at the fetomaternal interface is the uterine NK (uNK) cell, which constitutes approximately 70% of all immune cells found in this tissue.\n\n【140】Recruitment of circulating NK cells through decidual tissues: a possible mechanism controlling NK cell accumulation in the uterus during early pregnancy.\n\n【141】Uterine NK cells are thought to be recruited from peripheral blood when interleukin (IL)-15 is secreted by endometrial stromal cells.\n\n【142】They are distinct from peripheral blood NK cells in that they do not express CD16, the FcRγIIIA receptor required for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\n【143】The mechanisms associated with this loss of CD16 are unclear but may be related to high levels of TGF-β within the microenvironment.\n\n【144】TGFβ promotes conversion of CD16 <sup>+ </sup> peripheral blood NK cells into CD16- NK cells with similarities to decidual NK cells.\n\n【145】Also, in contrast to peripheral blood NK cells, uNK cells are more immunomodulatory than cytotoxic, secreting galectin 1 to induce tolerogenic DCs\n\n【146】Human decidual natural killer cells are a unique NK cell subset with immunomodulatory potential.\n\n【147】as well as angiogenic factors VEGF and PGF that are important for decidual remodeling.\n\n【148】Decidual NK cells regulate key developmental processes at the human fetal-maternal interface.\n\n【149】An improper balance of cytotoxic to regulatory NK cells could contribute to recurrent miscarriage and pre-eclampsia.\n\n【150】Expression of IL-15 and NK cell infiltration have been reported in many different malignancies,\n\n【151】IFN-γ acts on T cells to induce NK cell mobilization and accumulation in target organs.\n\n【152】including renal cell carcinoma,\n\n【153】Membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-15 on renal tumor cells rescues natural killer cells from IL-2 starvation-induced apoptosis.\n\n【154】with variable prognostic implications. Recently, tumor-infiltrating CD16-NK cells have also been characterized and appear to behave similarly to uNK cells with respect to cytokine production and reduced cytotoxic activity.\n\n【155】Natural killer cells infiltrating human nonsmall-cell lung cancer are enriched in CD56 bright CD16 (-) cells and display an impaired capability to kill tumor cells.\n\n【156】A closer look at factors that determine the balance of killer and regulatory NK cells during pregnancy may help identify mechanisms that shift immunity toward NK cytotoxic activity in patients with cancer.\n\n【157】Also infiltrating the decidua, albeit in smaller numbers than uNK cells, are macrophages, T <sub>reg </sub> , and DCs. Macrophages phagocytose apoptotic EVT cells and secrete IL-10 and IDO, contributing to the tolerogenic T <sub>H </sub> 2 milieu.\n\n【158】Gene expression profiling of decidual macrophages supports an immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory phenotype with higher expression of _CCL18, IGF1, IDO_ , neuropilin 1, and other genes associated with M2-polarized macrophages.\n\n【159】Gene expression profiling of human decidual macrophages: evidence for immunosuppressive phenotype.\n\n【160】Tumor-associated macrophages can be both inflammatory and immunosuppressive, and T <sub>H </sub> 1/T <sub>H </sub> 2 polarization is effected through the activation of NF-κB (also known as NFKB1).\n\n【161】In fact, in vitro studies suggest that tumor-associated macrophages may be re-educated to display a classically activated rather than an M2 phenotype by inhibition of inhibitory kappa B kinase β, the major activator of NF-κB.\n\n【162】“Re-educating” tumor-associated macrophages by targeting NF-κB.\n\n【163】Regulatory T cells are additional important mediators of tolerance in both pregnancy and cancer. Immunophenotypically, these cells express surface CD4, CD25, and FOXP3, and they expand in both decidua\n\n【164】and peripheral blood\n\n【165】during normal pregnancies.

Regulatory T cells in patients with cancer also recognize tumor-specific antigens and proliferate in response to antigenic stimulation.\n\n【177】Targeting the T <sub>reg </sub> population to boost antitumor immunity is under investigation with agents such as denileukin diftitox (IL2/diphtheria fusion protein) or LMB-2 (Fv fragment of CD25 antibody/ _Pseudomonas_ endotoxin A fusion protein) and CTLA-4 inhibitors.\n\n【178】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【179】Some of the benefit of cytotoxic chemotherapy may be derived from concomitant impairment of the immunosuppressive T <sub>reg </sub> proliferation driven by the cancer.\n\n【180】Antigen-presenting CD83 <sup>+ </sup> DCs are involved in the maintenance of the T <sub>H </sub> 2-predominant state in decidual tissues,\n\n【181】Predominance of Th2-promoting dendritic cells in early human pregnancy decidua.\n\n【182】as well as at other mucosal surfaces.\n\n【183】Human decidua contains potent immunostimulatory CD83 <sup>+ </sup> dendritic cells.\n\n【184】However, the role of the DC is likely more complex than antigen presentation and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. Ablation of uterine DCs leads to decidualization failure and embryo resorption in mice; this occurs even with syngeneic pregnancy in mice in which alloantigens are absent.\n\n【185】Uterine DCs are crucial for decidua formation during embryo implantation in mice.\n\n【186】Dendritic cells also represent another link between immunity and angiogenesis, secreting soluble FLT1 (also known as VEGFR1) and TGF-β1 required for endothelial cell survival and vascular maturation. In the absence of DCs, angiogenesis is severely impaired. In cancer, DCs also play a role that is more than immunoregulatory through their production of potent angiogenic growth factors. Moreover, cancer cells can secrete substances that suppress maturation of DCs, including VEGF, TGF-β, hepatocyte growth factor, and osteopontin, thereby maintaining a proangiogenic, immature DC phenotype.\n\n【187】Expression of certain cell surface molecules on both trophoblast and cancer cells can also confer immunologic protection. Among the most important of these molecules is the nonpolymorphic, highly conserved class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules such as HLAG\n\n【188】 in contrast, the highly diverse classical HLA class I proteins A, B, and C are essential in cell-mediated immune responses. In fact, in trophoblast cells, interferon-γ fails to stimulate classical HLA class I expression.\n\n【189】A similar property of down-regulated or absent classical HLA class I expression can cloak cancer cells from the host's immune system.\n\n【190】Cancer treatment modalities including gamma irradiation,\n\n【191】Gamma-radiation upregulates MHC class I/II and ICAM-I molecules in multiple myeloma cell lines and primary tumors.\n\n【192】radiopharmaceutical samarium-153-ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate,\n\n【193】The use of chelated radionuclide (samarium-153-ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate) to modulate phenotype of tumor cells and enhance T cell-mediated killing.\n\n【194】and chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil\n\n【195】5-fluorouracil derivatives induce differentiation mediated by tubulin and HLA class I modulation.\n\n【196】and hypomethylating agents\n\n【197】Functional up-regulation of human leukocyte antigen class I antigens expression by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine in cutaneous melanoma: immunotherapeutic implications.\n\n【198】increase HLA class I expression.\n\n【199】Expression of HLAG on trophoblast cells and cancer cells has important immunomodulatory effects.

Within the tumor microenvironment, the generation of HLAG <sup>+ </sup> —suppressive NK cells occurs by trogocytosis (ie, the rapid cell-to-cell contact-dependent transfer of membranes and associated molecules from one cell to another), leading to the inhibition of other HLAG <sup>+ </sup> (cross-inhibition) or HLAG <sup>− </sup> NK cells through HLAG and ILT2 cross-linking.\n\n【206】Trogocytosis-based generation of suppressive NK cells.\n\n【207】Expression of HLAG is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders,\n\n【208】HLA-G and lymphoproliferative disorders.\n\n【209】melanoma,\n\n【210】Quantitative HLA-G expression in metastasising and non-metastasising primary thin cutaneous melanomas \\[letter\\].\n\n【211】mesothelioma,\n\n【212】Expression of HLA-G in malignant mesothelioma and clinically aggressive breast carcinoma.\n\n【213】breast carcinoma,\n\n【214】Expression of HLA-G in malignant mesothelioma and clinically aggressive breast carcinoma.\n\n【215】ovarian carcinoma,\n\n【216】HLA-G expression in effusions is a possible marker of tumor susceptibility to chemotherapy in ovarian carcinoma.\n\n【217】renal cell carcinoma,\n\n【218】squamous esophageal cancer,\n\n【219】gastric carcinoma,\n\n【220】cervical cancer,\n\n【221】non—small cell lung cancer,\n\n【222】bladder cancer,\n\n【223】Expression of HLA-G in cancer bladder.\n\n【224】prostate cancer,\n\n【225】endometrial cancer,\n\n【226】colorectal cancer,\n\n【227】and myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n【228】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【229】Unfavourable clinical implications for HLA-G expression in acute myeloid leukaemia.\n\n【230】However, relatively little is known about the regulation of the expression of this important immunomodulatory molecule.\n\n【231】Regulation of HLAG expression may be at the epigenetic level, with transcription of HLAG being detectable in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine.\n\n【232】Some preliminary evidence also supports a micro-RNA regulatory mechanism.\n\n【233】Clearly, HLAG represents an attractive target for immune-based cancer therapies given its preferential expression in many malignancies as well as limited expression in normal tissues.\n\n【234】The HLA-G gene is expressed at a low mRNA level in different human cells and tissues.\n\n【235】Targeting HLAG with a peptide-based vaccine strategy to develop a cytotoxic T-cell response against tumor cells bearing the molecule has proved feasible,\n\n【236】HLA-G as a target molecule in specific immunotherapy against renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【237】although much work remains before other methods of HLAG inhibition could lead to restoration of antitumor immunity.\n\n【238】Other cell surface tolerance signals common between trophoblasts and cancer cells include CD200 (OX-2) and CEACAM-1.

Implantation of the blastocyst occurs in a T <sub>H </sub> 1-predominant (inflammatory) milieu, but the fetomaternal interface must transition to a T <sub>H </sub> 2-polarized (immunologically tolerant) state for pregnancy to continue (for an excellent review, refer to van Mourik et al\n\n【258】).

We have also verified that these immunomodulatory genes are differentially expressed in melanoma vs benign melanocytic nevi in 2 independent publically available datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information/GenBank GEO database: GSE4587,\n\n【371】which was analyzed on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and GSE3189,\n\n【372】Novel genes associated with malignant melanoma but not benign melanocytic lesions.\n\n【373】which was analyzed on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Array Set HG-U133A platform (Affymetrix).

A summary of results is listed in Table 2 . Osteopontin and other important components of innate immunity such as _TLR2_ and _TLR4_ and _PTX3_ were significantly up-regulated in melanoma compared with benign nevi. Galectins 1 and 9 were also significantly up-regulated compared with nevi.

Overall, this pattern is supportive of our theory that tumor cells use similar mechanisms of immune escape as those cells of the developing placenta, although these similarities have not yet been studied in a systematic fashion. Given what we have learned about the similarities between the placenta and tumor microenvironment, we plan to next comprehensively evaluate changes in systemic immune homeostasis in pregnancy vs cancer in order to prioritize potential therapeutic targets.

The challenge for investigators in this field will be to extend our observations beyond the T <sub>H </sub> 1/T <sub>H </sub> 2 paradigm in both pregnancy and cancer to a model that can both assess the status and guide treatment of malignancies in an individualized, rational, real-time manner. A critical need exists for the development of treatments aimed at all aspects of cancer: malignant proliferation, invasion, vasculogenic mimicry, angiogenesis, and immune privilege. Studying how all these aspects are orchestrated in the predictable, physiologic process of pregnancy can facilitate the search for novel cancer treatment strategies, from cytotoxic chemotherapy to biologic agents and immunologic adjuncts, in the often unpredictable and arduous fight against the pathologic process of cancer.\n\n【386】### Glossary of Genetics Terminology\n\n【387】_AKT_\n\n【388】v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog\n\n【389】_ALK_\n\n【390】anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase\n\n【391】_BCL2_\n\n【392】B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2\n\n【393】_CDK_\n\n【394】cyclin dependent kinase\n\n【395】_CEACAM1_\n\n【396】carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (biliary glycoprotein)\n\n【397】_CMET_ (also known as _MET_ )\n\n【398】met proto-oncogene (hepatocyte growth factor) receptor\n\n【399】_CSF_\n\n【400】colony-stimulating factor\n\n【401】_CSF1R_\n\n【402】CSF type 1 receptor\n\n【403】_CXCR4_\n\n【404】chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4\n\n【405】_EGF_\n\n【406】epidermal growth factor (beta-urogastrone)\n\n【407】_ERK_\n\n【408】extracellular signal—related kinase\n\n【409】_FABP4_\n\n【410】fatty acid—binding protein 4\n\n【411】_FAK_\n\n【412】focal adhesion kinase\n\n【413】_FAS_\n\n【414】Fas (TNF receptor superfamily, member 6)\n\n【415】_FASL_\n\n【416】FAS ligand\n\n【417】_FCγIIIA_\n\n【418】FC gamma receptor III A\n\n【419】_FGF_\n\n【420】fibroblast growth factor\n\n【421】_FLT1_\n\n【422】fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor receptor)\n\n【423】_FOXP3_\n\n【424】forkhead box P3\n\n【425】_FZD10_\n\n【426】frizzled homolog 10\n\n【427】_GRO-α_\n\n【428】growth-related oncogene α\n\n【429】_HGF_\n\n【430】hepatocyte growth factor\n\n【431】_HIF-1α_\n\n【432】hypoxia inducible factor 1α\n\n【433】_HSP27_\n\n【434】heat shock protein 27\n\n【435】_IDO_\n\n【436】indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase\n\n【437】_IGF_\n\n【438】insulinlike growth factor\n\n【439】_IGF1R_\n\n【440】IGF type 1 receptor\n\n【441】_ILT2_\n\n【442】Ig-like transcript 2\n\n【443】_JAK_\n\n【444】janus kinase\n\n【445】_LGALS_ 1\n\n【446】galactin 1\n\n【447】_LGALS_ 9\n\n【448】galactin 9\n\n【449】_LPL_\n\n【450】lipoprotein lipase\n\n【451】_MAPK_\n\n【452】mitogen-activated protein kinase\n\n【453】_MCP_ 1\n\n【454】monocyte chemoattractant protein 1\n\n【455】_MEK_ (also known as _MAP2K_ )\n\n【456】MAPK/ERK kinase\n\n【457】_MIF_\n\n【458】macrophage migration inhibitory factor\n\n【459】_Mig-_ 7\n\n【460】migration-induction protein 7\n\n【461】_MDM_ 2\n\n【462】mouse double minute 2\n\n【463】_MMP_\n\n【464】matrix metalloproteinase\n\n【465】_MTOR_\n\n【466】mammalian target of rapamycin\n\n【467】_MUC1_\n\n【468】mucin 1\n\n【469】_NF-κB_\n\n【470】nuclear factor κB\n\n【471】_p38_\n\n【472】tumor protein 38\n\n【473】_PAR1_\n\n【474】protease activated receptor 1\n\n【475】_PDGF_\n\n【476】platelet-derived growth factor\n\n【477】_PDGFR_\n\n【478】PDGF receptor\n\n【479】_PEDF_\n\n【480】pigment epithelial—derived factor\n\n【481】_PGE2_\n\n【482】prostaglandin E2\n\n【483】_PGF_\n\n【484】placental growth factor\n\n【485】_PI3K_\n\n【486】phosphoinositide-3 kinase\n\n【487】_PSG1_\n\n【488】pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1\n\n【489】_PTX3_\n\n【490】pentraxin 3\n\n【491】_RANTES_ (also known as _CCL5_ )\n\n【492】regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted\n\n【493】_RAF_\n\n【494】v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1\n\n【495】_RAS_\n\n【496】rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog\n\n【497】_SDF_ (also known as _CXCL12_ )\n\n【498】stromal-derived factor 1\n\n【499】_SPP1_\n\n【500】osteopontin\n\n【501】_STAT_\n\n【502】signal transducers and activator of transcription\n\n【503】_TGF_\n\n【504】transforming growth factor\n\n【505】_TIM3_ (also known as _HAVCR2_ )\n\n【506】T cell immunoglobulin mucin 3\n\n【507】_TIMP2_\n\n【508】tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2\n\n【509】_TLR_\n\n【510】toll-like receptor\n\n【511】_TNF_\n\n【512】tumor necrosis factor\n\n【513】_TRAIL_\n\n【514】TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand\n\n【515】_TRAILR_\n\n【516】TRAIL receptor\n\n【517】_uPA_\n\n【518】urokinase plasminogen activator\n\n【519】_VEGF_\n\n【520】vascular endothelial growth factor\n\n【521】_VEGFR_\n\n【522】VEGF receptor\n\n【523】_waf1/cip1_ (also known as _CDKN1A_ )\n\n【524】cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A\n\n【525】_Wnt_\n\n【526】wingless/T-cell factor\n\n【527】_XIAP_\n\n【528】X-link inhibitor of apoptosis protein\n\n【529】Author Interview\n----------------\n\n【530】Interview with Dr. Shernan Holtan", "index": 11790, "show": true, "start": 11777, "end": 11912, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": " For expansion of all gene symbols, see Glossary to Genetics Terminology at the end of the article.", "content": "【0】Cancer and Pregnancy: Parallels in Growth, Invasion, and Immune Modulation and Implications for Cancer Therapeutic Agents\nMany proliferative, invasive, and immune tolerance mechanisms that support normal human pregnancy are also exploited by malignancies to establish a nutrient supply and evade or edit the host immune response. In addition to the shared capacity for invading through normal tissues, both cancer cells and cells of the developing placenta create a microenvironment supportive of both immunologic privilege and angiogenesis. Systemic alterations in immunity are also detectable, particularly with respect to a helper T cell type 2 polarization evident in advanced cancers and midtrimester pregnancy. This review summarizes the similarities between growth and immune privilege in cancer and pregnancy and identifies areas for further investigation. Our PubMed search strategy included combinations of terms such as _immune tolerance, pregnancy, cancer, cytokines, angiogenesis_ , and _invasion_ . We did not place any restrictions on publication dates. The knowledge gained from analyzing similarities and differences between the physiologic state of pregnancy and the pathologic state of cancer could lead to identification of new potential targets for cancer therapeutic agents.\n\n【1】CTL ( CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte ), DC ( dendritic cell ), EVT ( extravillous trophoblast ), HLA ( human leukocyte antigen ), IL ( interleukin ), NK ( natural killer ), TH1 ( helper T cell type 1 ), TH2 ( helper T cell type 2 ), Treg ( regulatory T cell ), uNK ( uterine NK )\n\n【2】A substantial body of literature exists describing the mechanisms cancer cells use to escape apoptosis and migrate through normal structures while evading a host immune response. What is not well known, however, is how these complex and interrelated mechanisms are orchestrated, starting with modulation of the immune response within the tumor microenvironment and ending with migration and proliferation of cancer cells at distant sites. One potential model to further study how a single malignant cell could proliferate and then metastasize undetected within a host is that of normal human pregnancy, in which the developing placenta invades the uterus and a semiallogeneic fetus escapes rejection from the maternal immune system.\n\n【3】A multitude of immunomodulatory properties of the fetomaternal interface (placenta) have evolved to allow the survival of the immunologically distinct fetus to parturition without an attack from the maternal immune system. The similarities between the mechanisms involved in fetomaternal and tumor-associated immunologic tolerance are intriguing and suggest a common pattern; however, neither system of immune evasion is perfect. A clear example of placental failure to protect the fetus against maternal immunity is that of Rh incompatibility. In multiparous women sensitized against fetal Rh antigens, re-exposure to fetal Rh antigens with subsequent pregnancy may lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn and fetal death.\n\n【4】Such imperfections of shared mechanisms of immune tolerance between pregnancy and cancer suggest that cancer rejection via immunologic means may be possible, even considering the myriad mechanisms extending immunologic privilege to the fetus as well as cancer cells.\n\n【5】This review summarizes the parallels in proliferation, invasion, and immune privilege between cancer and pregnancy by first detailing shared characteristics of fetal-derived trophoblast cells of the placenta and tumor cells. It then describes the similarities between tolerogenic systems within the tumor microenvironment and the fetomaternal interface. Finally, it provides an overview of the evidence for systemic immune modulation in cancer and pregnancy and suggests the implications of these similarities in designing an integrated approach to cancer therapy. Our PubMed search strategy included combinations of terms such as _immune tolerance, pregnancy, cancer, cytokines, angiogenesis_ , and _invasion_ . We also searched for articles on cellular subsets, including natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory T cells (T <sub>reg </sub> ), and other lymphocyte populations with respect to their presence and function in pregnancy and cancer. We did not place any restrictions on publication dates. A better understanding of how the maternal immune system is altered during the normal processes of implantation, gestation, and labor may translate into individualized, novel therapies aimed at restoring immune competency in patients with advanced malignancies.\n\n【6】SHARED CHARACTERISTICS OF TROPHOBLAST CELLS AND TUMOR CELLS\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Five days after fertilization, the human zygote forms into a structure consisting of 2 primary cell lines: the inner cellmass (or embryoblast) and the trophoblast.\n\n【8】Trophoblast cells constitute the outer layer of the blastocyst, rapidly proliferating and invading the maternal endometrial decidua around day 7. A monolayer of cytotrophoblast cells surrounds the embryonic disc as the embryo completely embeds beneath the uterine decidua. By day 9, cytotrophoblast cells have differentiated into 2 distinct cell types: the syncytiotrophoblast and the extravillous trophoblast (EVT). The multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast cells form the external layer and are terminally differentiated. These cells are involved in fetomaternal nutrient exchanges and endocrine functions (such as β-human chorionic gonadotropic production). In contrast, EVT cells have a proliferative and invasive phenotype, migrating through the syncytiotrophoblast into the uterine wall to anchor the placenta beginning around day 14 after implantation.\n\n【9】These EVT cells display a phenotype strikingly similar to cancer cells with their capacity for proliferation, migration, and establishment of a blood supply, making them a compelling model for oncologic comparison . This review highlights several shared characteristics of trophoblast and tumor cells and discusses them in the context of existing or developmental targeted cancer therapeutics .\n\n【10】FIGURE Similarities between the fetomaternal interface and tumor microenvironment.

By binding to the IGF1R on cytotrophoblast cells, IGF stimulates proliferation through the MAPK pathway and survival via activation of the PI3K pathway.\n\n【48】Normally, levels of IGF are tightly regulated by IGF-binding proteins and protease pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, a binding protein.\n\n【49】Loss of binding protein regulation may contribute to the malignant phenotype.\n\n【50】In cancer cells, the IGF1R pathway is not only mitogenic and antiapoptotic but is involved in protecting cancer cells from damaging effects of chemotherapy and radiation, potentially as a result of its effects on downstream signaling pathways.\n\n【51】Additionally, the fetal form of the insulin receptor IR-A, which is highly expressed in fetal tissues and responsive to IGF2, is also a member of the IGF-signaling system.\n\n【52】In many cancers, including those of the breast and ovary, dysregulation of this fetal form of the insulin receptor becomes the predominant isoform leading to IGF2-stimulated proliferation and survival.\n\n【53】Elevated insulin receptor content in human breast cancer.\n\n【54】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【55】INVASION\n--------\n\n【56】The sine qua non of both a successful pregnancy and the growth of cancer is the establishment of a blood and nutrient supply, and invasion through normal tissues is required for this process. However, whereas cancer cells spread throughout the host and then engage in local proliferation, trophoblasts follow an organized pattern of differentiation from proliferation to invasion without distant metastasis.\n\n【57】Some of the molecular switches involved in this differentiation pattern and their relevance for cancer therapeutic agents are discussed in the sections that follow.\n\n【58】As EVT cells migrate down the cytotrophoblast cell columns into the maternal decidua , they encircle and erode into the maternal spiral arteries and differentiate from a proliferative phenotype into an invasive phenotype.\n\n【59】This differentiation occurs at about 10 to 12 weeks of gestation and is associated with opening of the intervillous space and exposure to maternal blood. Many parallels can be observed between invasive EVT cells and cancer cells. Some of these similarities are highlighted in the sections to follow; for a more in-depth discussion, readers should refer to excellent reviews by Soundararajan and Rao\n\n【60】and Ferretti et al.\n\n【61】Requirements for cellular invasion include changes in cell adhesion molecules, secretion of proteases, and availability of growth factors. An example of a cellular program used by both cancer cells\n\n【62】and trophoblast cells\n\n【63】to promote invasion is epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which results in loss of cell-to-cell contact inhibition.

The Wnt pathway, a system highly conserved across species involved in cellular proliferation and motility, has recently been implicated in switching trophoblast cells from a proliferative to an invasive phenotype.\n\n【74】Activation of the canonical wingless/T-cell factor signaling pathway promotes invasive differentiation of human trophoblast.\n\n【75】Activation of the Wnt pathway is aberrant in many cancers, resulting in escape of β-catenin from proteosomal degradation, with subsequent β-catenin translocation into the cell nucleus and activation of multiple target genes.\n\n【76】Although direct activation of β-catenin alone has shown no effect on motility of EVT cells, inhibition of the Wnt—β-catenin pathway can block blastocyst implantation.\n\n【77】Inactivation of nuclear Wnt-β-catenin signaling limits blastocyst competency for implantation.\n\n【78】In EVT cells, activation of PAR1 (also known as the thrombin receptor) also stabilizes β-catenin and is associated with a proliferative and invasive capacity, whereas application of PAR1-silencing RNA inhibits EVT invasion.\n\n【79】Consistent with the need for tight regulation of invasive trophoblast cells, PAR1 is expressed in EVT cells between the 7th and 10th gestational week but is abruptly shut off by the 12th week.\n\n【80】The pattern of expression of protease-activated receptors (PARs) during early trophoblast development.\n\n【81】Constitutive increased expression of PAR1 can be seen in cancer cells, especially in cells lacking normal p53 activity.\n\n【82】p53 controls hPar1 function and expression.\n\n【83】In vitro assays have shown PAR1 antagonism to inhibit MMP1-induced endothelial cell activation in tumor—endothelial cell communication.\n\n【84】Tumor-derived matrix metalloproteinase-1 targets endothelial proteinase-activated receptor 1 promoting endothelial cell activation.\n\n【85】Whether this system could successfully be targeted for cancer therapy is under investigation. Other signal transduction pathways common in both trophoblast and cancer cell invasion include the JAK-STAT pathway,\n\n【86】FAKs, G proteins, Rho-associated kinase, MAPKs, PI3K, and SMAD family proteins.\n\n【87】All of these pathways represent areas of current anticancer therapeutic development.\n\n【88】As EVTs acquire an invasive phenotype during placental development, they become polyploid (4N-8N) by switching from mitotic division to endoreduplication,\n\n【89】a process in which G2 or M phase (4N) cells replicate DNA without undergoing mitosis. In trophoblast cell lines, polyploid trophoblast giant cells are relatively resistant to the DNA-damaging effects of radiation,\n\n【90】illustrating a mechanism by which survival is promoted in invasive trophoblast cells. This process can also be observed in cancer cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. Endoreduplication can be induced in tumor cells on exposure to genotoxic agents such as paclitaxel\n\n【91】Cell cycle checkpoint efficiency and cellular response to paclitaxel in prostate cancer cells.\n\n【92】and cisplatin; a nonproliferative, senescent state in a small population of cells is induced in the latter case. The polyploid tumor cells can undergo depolyploidization to form diploid, cisplatin-resistant escape cells.\n\n【93】Tumor cells can escape DNA-damaging cisplatin through DNA endoreduplication and reversible polyploidy.\n\n【94】In cells with an impaired p53 system, treatment with the Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 leads to endoreduplication followed by apoptosis.\n\n【95】However, in 2 wild-type p53 cancer cell lines, stabilization of p53 by Nutlin-3a, an inhibitor of the p53-binding protein MDM2, leads to initial endoreduplication followed by the emergence of stable radiation- and cisplatin-resistant tetraploid clones.\n\n【96】A better understanding of the EVT endoreduplication process may lead to the development of targeted drugs to maintain tumor cell chemotherapeutic sensitivity.\n\n【97】VASCULOGENIC MIMICRY\n--------------------\n\n【98】As trophoblasts invade maternal spiral arteries, they further differentiate to display a vascular phenotype in a process termed _vasculogenic mimicry_ , in which cells other than endothelial cells form vascular structures.\n\n【99】Human cytotrophoblasts adopt a vascular phenotype as they differentiate: a strategy for successful endovascular invasion?\n\n【100】Vasculogenic mimicry can also be observed in aggressive cancers, and the genes and signaling pathways involved with the process of vasculogenic mimicry may be shared between EVT and cancer cells.\n\n【101】For example, the matrix glycoprotein—binding galectin 3 is highly expressed in EVT cells.\n\n【102】Galectin-3 also appears to be a key factor in the development of an endothelial phenotype and the tube formation well described in aggressive melanomas.\n\n【103】Galectin inhibitors are in preclinical testing as cancer therapeutic agents.\n\n【104】Synthetic inhibitors of galectin-1 and -3 selectively modulate homotypic cell aggregation and tumor cell apoptosis.\n\n【105】Mig-7 was found in circulating tumor cells and tumor tissue (regardless of tissue of origin) from more than 200 patients with cancer; notably, it was absent from healthy controls.\n\n【106】Mig-7 expression is associated with invasion and vasculogenic mimicry in cancer cells and also has recently been demonstrated in invasive embryonic cytotrophoblasts, peaking when EVT cells invade maternal decidua and remodel the vasculature during early placental development.\n\n【107】This finding represents the only known expression of Mig-7 in noncancerous cells.

Historically, the placenta was considered an inert, mechanical barrier protecting the semiallogeneic fetus from maternal immunologic attack.\n\n【136】Current evidence, however, supports just the opposite—many maternal and placental immunomodulatory factors are required for adequate placental invasion. Around 40% of decidual cells are cells of the innate immune system (eg, NK cells, macrophages, and DCs), a substantial proportion considering that the uterus is a nonlymphoid organ.\n\n【137】Likewise, although cancer previously has been considered immunologically invisible to the host, many recent studies support the notion that cancer cells actively engage immune cells; for example, the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has been well described in the literature.\n\n【138】The main components of the maternal immune response at the fetomaternal interface and the similarities to the tumor microenvironment are discussed in the sections that follow.\n\n【139】The most abundant immune cell present at the fetomaternal interface is the uterine NK (uNK) cell, which constitutes approximately 70% of all immune cells found in this tissue.\n\n【140】Recruitment of circulating NK cells through decidual tissues: a possible mechanism controlling NK cell accumulation in the uterus during early pregnancy.\n\n【141】Uterine NK cells are thought to be recruited from peripheral blood when interleukin (IL)-15 is secreted by endometrial stromal cells.\n\n【142】They are distinct from peripheral blood NK cells in that they do not express CD16, the FcRγIIIA receptor required for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\n【143】The mechanisms associated with this loss of CD16 are unclear but may be related to high levels of TGF-β within the microenvironment.\n\n【144】TGFβ promotes conversion of CD16 <sup>+ </sup> peripheral blood NK cells into CD16- NK cells with similarities to decidual NK cells.\n\n【145】Also, in contrast to peripheral blood NK cells, uNK cells are more immunomodulatory than cytotoxic, secreting galectin 1 to induce tolerogenic DCs\n\n【146】Human decidual natural killer cells are a unique NK cell subset with immunomodulatory potential.\n\n【147】as well as angiogenic factors VEGF and PGF that are important for decidual remodeling.\n\n【148】Decidual NK cells regulate key developmental processes at the human fetal-maternal interface.\n\n【149】An improper balance of cytotoxic to regulatory NK cells could contribute to recurrent miscarriage and pre-eclampsia.\n\n【150】Expression of IL-15 and NK cell infiltration have been reported in many different malignancies,\n\n【151】IFN-γ acts on T cells to induce NK cell mobilization and accumulation in target organs.\n\n【152】including renal cell carcinoma,\n\n【153】Membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-15 on renal tumor cells rescues natural killer cells from IL-2 starvation-induced apoptosis.\n\n【154】with variable prognostic implications. Recently, tumor-infiltrating CD16-NK cells have also been characterized and appear to behave similarly to uNK cells with respect to cytokine production and reduced cytotoxic activity.\n\n【155】Natural killer cells infiltrating human nonsmall-cell lung cancer are enriched in CD56 bright CD16 (-) cells and display an impaired capability to kill tumor cells.\n\n【156】A closer look at factors that determine the balance of killer and regulatory NK cells during pregnancy may help identify mechanisms that shift immunity toward NK cytotoxic activity in patients with cancer.\n\n【157】Also infiltrating the decidua, albeit in smaller numbers than uNK cells, are macrophages, T <sub>reg </sub> , and DCs. Macrophages phagocytose apoptotic EVT cells and secrete IL-10 and IDO, contributing to the tolerogenic T <sub>H </sub> 2 milieu.\n\n【158】Gene expression profiling of decidual macrophages supports an immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory phenotype with higher expression of _CCL18, IGF1, IDO_ , neuropilin 1, and other genes associated with M2-polarized macrophages.\n\n【159】Gene expression profiling of human decidual macrophages: evidence for immunosuppressive phenotype.\n\n【160】Tumor-associated macrophages can be both inflammatory and immunosuppressive, and T <sub>H </sub> 1/T <sub>H </sub> 2 polarization is effected through the activation of NF-κB (also known as NFKB1).\n\n【161】In fact, in vitro studies suggest that tumor-associated macrophages may be re-educated to display a classically activated rather than an M2 phenotype by inhibition of inhibitory kappa B kinase β, the major activator of NF-κB.\n\n【162】“Re-educating” tumor-associated macrophages by targeting NF-κB.\n\n【163】Regulatory T cells are additional important mediators of tolerance in both pregnancy and cancer. Immunophenotypically, these cells express surface CD4, CD25, and FOXP3, and they expand in both decidua\n\n【164】and peripheral blood\n\n【165】during normal pregnancies. This expansion is antigen-specific and is induced by paternal/fetal alloantigens\n\n【166】and not simply by hormonal changes in pregnancy.\n\n【167】Mechanisms of action of regulatory T cells specific for paternal antigens during pregnancy.\n\n【168】A decrease in this lymphocyte subset is associated with spontaneous abortion\n\n【169】and pre-eclampsia.\n\n【170】Distinct subsets of regulatory T cells during pregnancy: is the imbalance of these subsets involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia?\n\n【171】Regulatory T cells are also expanded in cancer and are implicated in impaired antitumor immunity,\n\n【172】suppression of effector T lymphocyte proliferation,\n\n【173】CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD25 <sup>+ </sup> CD127 (low/-) regulatory T cells express Foxp3 and suppress effector T cell proliferation and contribute to gastric cancers progression.\n\n【174】and increased tumor blood vessel density,\n\n【175】The presence of tumor-infiltrating FOXP3 <sup>+ </sup> lymphocytes correlates with intratumoral angiogenesis in endometrial cancer.\n\n【176】suggesting an important link between immunity and angiogenesis. Regulatory T cells in patients with cancer also recognize tumor-specific antigens and proliferate in response to antigenic stimulation.\n\n【177】Targeting the T <sub>reg </sub> population to boost antitumor immunity is under investigation with agents such as denileukin diftitox (IL2/diphtheria fusion protein) or LMB-2 (Fv fragment of CD25 antibody/ _Pseudomonas_ endotoxin A fusion protein) and CTLA-4 inhibitors.\n\n【178】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【179】Some of the benefit of cytotoxic chemotherapy may be derived from concomitant impairment of the immunosuppressive T <sub>reg </sub> proliferation driven by the cancer.\n\n【180】Antigen-presenting CD83 <sup>+ </sup> DCs are involved in the maintenance of the T <sub>H </sub> 2-predominant state in decidual tissues,\n\n【181】Predominance of Th2-promoting dendritic cells in early human pregnancy decidua.\n\n【182】as well as at other mucosal surfaces.\n\n【183】Human decidua contains potent immunostimulatory CD83 <sup>+ </sup> dendritic cells.\n\n【184】However, the role of the DC is likely more complex than antigen presentation and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. Ablation of uterine DCs leads to decidualization failure and embryo resorption in mice; this occurs even with syngeneic pregnancy in mice in which alloantigens are absent.\n\n【185】Uterine DCs are crucial for decidua formation during embryo implantation in mice.\n\n【186】Dendritic cells also represent another link between immunity and angiogenesis, secreting soluble FLT1 (also known as VEGFR1) and TGF-β1 required for endothelial cell survival and vascular maturation. In the absence of DCs, angiogenesis is severely impaired. In cancer, DCs also play a role that is more than immunoregulatory through their production of potent angiogenic growth factors. Moreover, cancer cells can secrete substances that suppress maturation of DCs, including VEGF, TGF-β, hepatocyte growth factor, and osteopontin, thereby maintaining a proangiogenic, immature DC phenotype.\n\n【187】Expression of certain cell surface molecules on both trophoblast and cancer cells can also confer immunologic protection. Among the most important of these molecules is the nonpolymorphic, highly conserved class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules such as HLAG\n\n【188】 in contrast, the highly diverse classical HLA class I proteins A, B, and C are essential in cell-mediated immune responses. In fact, in trophoblast cells, interferon-γ fails to stimulate classical HLA class I expression.\n\n【189】A similar property of down-regulated or absent classical HLA class I expression can cloak cancer cells from the host's immune system.\n\n【190】Cancer treatment modalities including gamma irradiation,\n\n【191】Gamma-radiation upregulates MHC class I/II and ICAM-I molecules in multiple myeloma cell lines and primary tumors.\n\n【192】radiopharmaceutical samarium-153-ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate,\n\n【193】The use of chelated radionuclide (samarium-153-ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate) to modulate phenotype of tumor cells and enhance T cell-mediated killing.\n\n【194】and chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil\n\n【195】5-fluorouracil derivatives induce differentiation mediated by tubulin and HLA class I modulation.\n\n【196】and hypomethylating agents\n\n【197】Functional up-regulation of human leukocyte antigen class I antigens expression by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine in cutaneous melanoma: immunotherapeutic implications.\n\n【198】increase HLA class I expression.\n\n【199】Expression of HLAG on trophoblast cells and cancer cells has important immunomodulatory effects. In the placenta, HLAG expression is most evident on EVTs at the fetomaternal interface, with lower expression at the proliferative area of the villous column and increased expression with invasive, interstitial, and endovascular EVT cells.\n\n【200】Human placental HLA-G expression is restricted to differentiated cytotrophoblasts.\n\n【201】On the basis of sequence homologies, _HLAG_ has been proposed as the ancestral MHC class I gene and has only a few known sequence variations in humans, in sharp contrast to the profound allelic diversity (measured in the hundreds of allelic variants) of classical MHC class I genes.\n\n【202】Evolution of MHC-G in primates: a different kind of molecule for each group of species.\n\n【203】Human leukocyte antigen-G interacts with NK cells via inhibitory receptors, such as CD94/NKG2A, ILT2, and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor KIR2DL4.\n\n【204】The role of HLAG is to suppress cytolytic killing by both NK and cytotoxic T cells, induce apoptosis of immune cells, regulate cytokine production in blood mononuclear cells, and reduce stimulatory capacity and impair maturation of DCs (reviewed in Hunt et al\n\n【205】). Within the tumor microenvironment, the generation of HLAG <sup>+ </sup> —suppressive NK cells occurs by trogocytosis (ie, the rapid cell-to-cell contact-dependent transfer of membranes and associated molecules from one cell to another), leading to the inhibition of other HLAG <sup>+ </sup> (cross-inhibition) or HLAG <sup>− </sup> NK cells through HLAG and ILT2 cross-linking.\n\n【206】Trogocytosis-based generation of suppressive NK cells.\n\n【207】Expression of HLAG is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders,\n\n【208】HLA-G and lymphoproliferative disorders.\n\n【209】melanoma,\n\n【210】Quantitative HLA-G expression in metastasising and non-metastasising primary thin cutaneous melanomas \\[letter\\].\n\n【211】mesothelioma,\n\n【212】Expression of HLA-G in malignant mesothelioma and clinically aggressive breast carcinoma.\n\n【213】breast carcinoma,\n\n【214】Expression of HLA-G in malignant mesothelioma and clinically aggressive breast carcinoma.\n\n【215】ovarian carcinoma,\n\n【216】HLA-G expression in effusions is a possible marker of tumor susceptibility to chemotherapy in ovarian carcinoma.\n\n【217】renal cell carcinoma,\n\n【218】squamous esophageal cancer,\n\n【219】gastric carcinoma,\n\n【220】cervical cancer,\n\n【221】non—small cell lung cancer,\n\n【222】bladder cancer,\n\n【223】Expression of HLA-G in cancer bladder.\n\n【224】prostate cancer,\n\n【225】endometrial cancer,\n\n【226】colorectal cancer,\n\n【227】and myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n【228】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【229】Unfavourable clinical implications for HLA-G expression in acute myeloid leukaemia.\n\n【230】However, relatively little is known about the regulation of the expression of this important immunomodulatory molecule.\n\n【231】Regulation of HLAG expression may be at the epigenetic level, with transcription of HLAG being detectable in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine.\n\n【232】Some preliminary evidence also supports a micro-RNA regulatory mechanism.\n\n【233】Clearly, HLAG represents an attractive target for immune-based cancer therapies given its preferential expression in many malignancies as well as limited expression in normal tissues.\n\n【234】The HLA-G gene is expressed at a low mRNA level in different human cells and tissues.\n\n【235】Targeting HLAG with a peptide-based vaccine strategy to develop a cytotoxic T-cell response against tumor cells bearing the molecule has proved feasible,\n\n【236】HLA-G as a target molecule in specific immunotherapy against renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【237】although much work remains before other methods of HLAG inhibition could lead to restoration of antitumor immunity.\n\n【238】Other cell surface tolerance signals common between trophoblasts and cancer cells include CD200 (OX-2) and CEACAM-1.

Implantation of the blastocyst occurs in a T <sub>H </sub> 1-predominant (inflammatory) milieu, but the fetomaternal interface must transition to a T <sub>H </sub> 2-polarized (immunologically tolerant) state for pregnancy to continue (for an excellent review, refer to van Mourik et al\n\n【258】).

We have also verified that these immunomodulatory genes are differentially expressed in melanoma vs benign melanocytic nevi in 2 independent publically available datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information/GenBank GEO database: GSE4587,\n\n【371】which was analyzed on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and GSE3189,\n\n【372】Novel genes associated with malignant melanoma but not benign melanocytic lesions.\n\n【373】which was analyzed on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Array Set HG-U133A platform (Affymetrix).

A summary of results is listed in Table 2 . Osteopontin and other important components of innate immunity such as _TLR2_ and _TLR4_ and _PTX3_ were significantly up-regulated in melanoma compared with benign nevi. Galectins 1 and 9 were also significantly up-regulated compared with nevi.

Overall, this pattern is supportive of our theory that tumor cells use similar mechanisms of immune escape as those cells of the developing placenta, although these similarities have not yet been studied in a systematic fashion. Given what we have learned about the similarities between the placenta and tumor microenvironment, we plan to next comprehensively evaluate changes in systemic immune homeostasis in pregnancy vs cancer in order to prioritize potential therapeutic targets. In particular, identifying immunologic distinctions between pregnancy and cancer will be critical for this process.\n\n【378】TABLE 2 Immunomodulatory Genes Differentially Expressed in Melanoma vs Benign Melanocytic Lesions\n\n【379】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【380】IL-8 = interleukin 8.

The challenge for investigators in this field will be to extend our observations beyond the T <sub>H </sub> 1/T <sub>H </sub> 2 paradigm in both pregnancy and cancer to a model that can both assess the status and guide treatment of malignancies in an individualized, rational, real-time manner. A critical need exists for the development of treatments aimed at all aspects of cancer: malignant proliferation, invasion, vasculogenic mimicry, angiogenesis, and immune privilege. Studying how all these aspects are orchestrated in the predictable, physiologic process of pregnancy can facilitate the search for novel cancer treatment strategies, from cytotoxic chemotherapy to biologic agents and immunologic adjuncts, in the often unpredictable and arduous fight against the pathologic process of cancer.\n\n【386】### Glossary of Genetics Terminology\n\n【387】_AKT_\n\n【388】v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog\n\n【389】_ALK_\n\n【390】anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase\n\n【391】_BCL2_\n\n【392】B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2\n\n【393】_CDK_\n\n【394】cyclin dependent kinase\n\n【395】_CEACAM1_\n\n【396】carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (biliary glycoprotein)\n\n【397】_CMET_ (also known as _MET_ )\n\n【398】met proto-oncogene (hepatocyte growth factor) receptor\n\n【399】_CSF_\n\n【400】colony-stimulating factor\n\n【401】_CSF1R_\n\n【402】CSF type 1 receptor\n\n【403】_CXCR4_\n\n【404】chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4\n\n【405】_EGF_\n\n【406】epidermal growth factor (beta-urogastrone)\n\n【407】_ERK_\n\n【408】extracellular signal—related kinase\n\n【409】_FABP4_\n\n【410】fatty acid—binding protein 4\n\n【411】_FAK_\n\n【412】focal adhesion kinase\n\n【413】_FAS_\n\n【414】Fas (TNF receptor superfamily, member 6)\n\n【415】_FASL_\n\n【416】FAS ligand\n\n【417】_FCγIIIA_\n\n【418】FC gamma receptor III A\n\n【419】_FGF_\n\n【420】fibroblast growth factor\n\n【421】_FLT1_\n\n【422】fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor receptor)\n\n【423】_FOXP3_\n\n【424】forkhead box P3\n\n【425】_FZD10_\n\n【426】frizzled homolog 10\n\n【427】_GRO-α_\n\n【428】growth-related oncogene α\n\n【429】_HGF_\n\n【430】hepatocyte growth factor\n\n【431】_HIF-1α_\n\n【432】hypoxia inducible factor 1α\n\n【433】_HSP27_\n\n【434】heat shock protein 27\n\n【435】_IDO_\n\n【436】indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase\n\n【437】_IGF_\n\n【438】insulinlike growth factor\n\n【439】_IGF1R_\n\n【440】IGF type 1 receptor\n\n【441】_ILT2_\n\n【442】Ig-like transcript 2\n\n【443】_JAK_\n\n【444】janus kinase\n\n【445】_LGALS_ 1\n\n【446】galactin 1\n\n【447】_LGALS_ 9\n\n【448】galactin 9\n\n【449】_LPL_\n\n【450】lipoprotein lipase\n\n【451】_MAPK_\n\n【452】mitogen-activated protein kinase\n\n【453】_MCP_ 1\n\n【454】monocyte chemoattractant protein 1\n\n【455】_MEK_ (also known as _MAP2K_ )\n\n【456】MAPK/ERK kinase\n\n【457】_MIF_\n\n【458】macrophage migration inhibitory factor\n\n【459】_Mig-_ 7\n\n【460】migration-induction protein 7\n\n【461】_MDM_ 2\n\n【462】mouse double minute 2\n\n【463】_MMP_\n\n【464】matrix metalloproteinase\n\n【465】_MTOR_\n\n【466】mammalian target of rapamycin\n\n【467】_MUC1_\n\n【468】mucin 1\n\n【469】_NF-κB_\n\n【470】nuclear factor κB\n\n【471】_p38_\n\n【472】tumor protein 38\n\n【473】_PAR1_\n\n【474】protease activated receptor 1\n\n【475】_PDGF_\n\n【476】platelet-derived growth factor\n\n【477】_PDGFR_\n\n【478】PDGF receptor\n\n【479】_PEDF_\n\n【480】pigment epithelial—derived factor\n\n【481】_PGE2_\n\n【482】prostaglandin E2\n\n【483】_PGF_\n\n【484】placental growth factor\n\n【485】_PI3K_\n\n【486】phosphoinositide-3 kinase\n\n【487】_PSG1_\n\n【488】pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1\n\n【489】_PTX3_\n\n【490】pentraxin 3\n\n【491】_RANTES_ (also known as _CCL5_ )\n\n【492】regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted\n\n【493】_RAF_\n\n【494】v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1\n\n【495】_RAS_\n\n【496】rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog\n\n【497】_SDF_ (also known as _CXCL12_ )\n\n【498】stromal-derived factor 1\n\n【499】_SPP1_\n\n【500】osteopontin\n\n【501】_STAT_\n\n【502】signal transducers and activator of transcription\n\n【503】_TGF_\n\n【504】transforming growth factor\n\n【505】_TIM3_ (also known as _HAVCR2_ )\n\n【506】T cell immunoglobulin mucin 3\n\n【507】_TIMP2_\n\n【508】tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2\n\n【509】_TLR_\n\n【510】toll-like receptor\n\n【511】_TNF_\n\n【512】tumor necrosis factor\n\n【513】_TRAIL_\n\n【514】TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand\n\n【515】_TRAILR_\n\n【516】TRAIL receptor\n\n【517】_uPA_\n\n【518】urokinase plasminogen activator\n\n【519】_VEGF_\n\n【520】vascular endothelial growth factor\n\n【521】_VEGFR_\n\n【522】VEGF receptor\n\n【523】_waf1/cip1_ (also known as _CDKN1A_ )\n\n【524】cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A\n\n【525】_Wnt_\n\n【526】wingless/T-cell factor\n\n【527】_XIAP_\n\n【528】X-link inhibitor of apoptosis protein\n\n【529】Author Interview\n----------------\n\n【530】Interview with Dr. Shernan Holtan", "index": 60620, "show": true, "start": 60594, "end": 60693, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}, {"text": "【382】a IL-8 = interleukin 8.

In addition to the shared capacity for invading through normal tissues, both cancer cells and cells of the developing placenta create a microenvironment supportive of both immunologic privilege and angiogenesis. Systemic alterations in immunity are also detectable, particularly with respect to a helper T cell type 2 polarization evident in advanced cancers and midtrimester pregnancy. This review summarizes the similarities between growth and immune privilege in cancer and pregnancy and identifies areas for further investigation. Our PubMed search strategy included combinations of terms such as _immune tolerance, pregnancy, cancer, cytokines, angiogenesis_ , and _invasion_ . We did not place any restrictions on publication dates. The knowledge gained from analyzing similarities and differences between the physiologic state of pregnancy and the pathologic state of cancer could lead to identification of new potential targets for cancer therapeutic agents.\n\n【1】CTL ( CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte ), DC ( dendritic cell ), EVT ( extravillous trophoblast ), HLA ( human leukocyte antigen ), IL ( interleukin ), NK ( natural killer ), TH1 ( helper T cell type 1 ), TH2 ( helper T cell type 2 ), Treg ( regulatory T cell ), uNK ( uterine NK )\n\n【2】A substantial body of literature exists describing the mechanisms cancer cells use to escape apoptosis and migrate through normal structures while evading a host immune response. What is not well known, however, is how these complex and interrelated mechanisms are orchestrated, starting with modulation of the immune response within the tumor microenvironment and ending with migration and proliferation of cancer cells at distant sites. One potential model to further study how a single malignant cell could proliferate and then metastasize undetected within a host is that of normal human pregnancy, in which the developing placenta invades the uterus and a semiallogeneic fetus escapes rejection from the maternal immune system.\n\n【3】A multitude of immunomodulatory properties of the fetomaternal interface (placenta) have evolved to allow the survival of the immunologically distinct fetus to parturition without an attack from the maternal immune system. The similarities between the mechanisms involved in fetomaternal and tumor-associated immunologic tolerance are intriguing and suggest a common pattern; however, neither system of immune evasion is perfect. A clear example of placental failure to protect the fetus against maternal immunity is that of Rh incompatibility. In multiparous women sensitized against fetal Rh antigens, re-exposure to fetal Rh antigens with subsequent pregnancy may lead to hemolytic disease of the newborn and fetal death.\n\n【4】Such imperfections of shared mechanisms of immune tolerance between pregnancy and cancer suggest that cancer rejection via immunologic means may be possible, even considering the myriad mechanisms extending immunologic privilege to the fetus as well as cancer cells.\n\n【5】This review summarizes the parallels in proliferation, invasion, and immune privilege between cancer and pregnancy by first detailing shared characteristics of fetal-derived trophoblast cells of the placenta and tumor cells. It then describes the similarities between tolerogenic systems within the tumor microenvironment and the fetomaternal interface. Finally, it provides an overview of the evidence for systemic immune modulation in cancer and pregnancy and suggests the implications of these similarities in designing an integrated approach to cancer therapy. Our PubMed search strategy included combinations of terms such as _immune tolerance, pregnancy, cancer, cytokines, angiogenesis_ , and _invasion_ . We also searched for articles on cellular subsets, including natural killer (NK) cells, dendritic cells (DCs), regulatory T cells (T <sub>reg </sub> ), and other lymphocyte populations with respect to their presence and function in pregnancy and cancer. We did not place any restrictions on publication dates. A better understanding of how the maternal immune system is altered during the normal processes of implantation, gestation, and labor may translate into individualized, novel therapies aimed at restoring immune competency in patients with advanced malignancies.\n\n【6】SHARED CHARACTERISTICS OF TROPHOBLAST CELLS AND TUMOR CELLS\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Five days after fertilization, the human zygote forms into a structure consisting of 2 primary cell lines: the inner cellmass (or embryoblast) and the trophoblast.\n\n【8】Trophoblast cells constitute the outer layer of the blastocyst, rapidly proliferating and invading the maternal endometrial decidua around day 7. A monolayer of cytotrophoblast cells surrounds the embryonic disc as the embryo completely embeds beneath the uterine decidua. By day 9, cytotrophoblast cells have differentiated into 2 distinct cell types: the syncytiotrophoblast and the extravillous trophoblast (EVT). The multinucleated syncytiotrophoblast cells form the external layer and are terminally differentiated. These cells are involved in fetomaternal nutrient exchanges and endocrine functions (such as β-human chorionic gonadotropic production). In contrast, EVT cells have a proliferative and invasive phenotype, migrating through the syncytiotrophoblast into the uterine wall to anchor the placenta beginning around day 14 after implantation.\n\n【9】These EVT cells display a phenotype strikingly similar to cancer cells with their capacity for proliferation, migration, and establishment of a blood supply, making them a compelling model for oncologic comparison . This review highlights several shared characteristics of trophoblast and tumor cells and discusses them in the context of existing or developmental targeted cancer therapeutics .\n\n【10】FIGURE Similarities between the fetomaternal interface and tumor microenvironment.

By binding to the IGF1R on cytotrophoblast cells, IGF stimulates proliferation through the MAPK pathway and survival via activation of the PI3K pathway.\n\n【48】Normally, levels of IGF are tightly regulated by IGF-binding proteins and protease pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, a binding protein.\n\n【49】Loss of binding protein regulation may contribute to the malignant phenotype.\n\n【50】In cancer cells, the IGF1R pathway is not only mitogenic and antiapoptotic but is involved in protecting cancer cells from damaging effects of chemotherapy and radiation, potentially as a result of its effects on downstream signaling pathways.\n\n【51】Additionally, the fetal form of the insulin receptor IR-A, which is highly expressed in fetal tissues and responsive to IGF2, is also a member of the IGF-signaling system.\n\n【52】In many cancers, including those of the breast and ovary, dysregulation of this fetal form of the insulin receptor becomes the predominant isoform leading to IGF2-stimulated proliferation and survival.\n\n【53】Elevated insulin receptor content in human breast cancer.\n\n【54】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【55】INVASION\n--------\n\n【56】The sine qua non of both a successful pregnancy and the growth of cancer is the establishment of a blood and nutrient supply, and invasion through normal tissues is required for this process. However, whereas cancer cells spread throughout the host and then engage in local proliferation, trophoblasts follow an organized pattern of differentiation from proliferation to invasion without distant metastasis.\n\n【57】Some of the molecular switches involved in this differentiation pattern and their relevance for cancer therapeutic agents are discussed in the sections that follow.\n\n【58】As EVT cells migrate down the cytotrophoblast cell columns into the maternal decidua , they encircle and erode into the maternal spiral arteries and differentiate from a proliferative phenotype into an invasive phenotype.\n\n【59】This differentiation occurs at about 10 to 12 weeks of gestation and is associated with opening of the intervillous space and exposure to maternal blood. Many parallels can be observed between invasive EVT cells and cancer cells. Some of these similarities are highlighted in the sections to follow; for a more in-depth discussion, readers should refer to excellent reviews by Soundararajan and Rao\n\n【60】and Ferretti et al.\n\n【61】Requirements for cellular invasion include changes in cell adhesion molecules, secretion of proteases, and availability of growth factors. An example of a cellular program used by both cancer cells\n\n【62】and trophoblast cells\n\n【63】to promote invasion is epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which results in loss of cell-to-cell contact inhibition. Associated with this program are changes in integrin expression and loss of E cadherin, allowing loss of polarity and enhanced motility.\n\n【64】Localization of E-cadherin in villous, extravillous and vascular trophoblasts during intrauterine, ectopic and molar pregnancy.\n\n【65】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【66】Expression of E-cadherin and its repressor snail in placental tissue of normal, preeclamptic and HELLP pregnancies.\n\n【67】Both trophoblast and cancer cells secrete proteases to degrade extracellular matrix proteins required for dispersal through tissues. The cytoplasm of migratory EVT cells express HSP27, which is correlated with MMP2 activity.\n\n【68】Basal HSP27 levels are unusually high in cancer cells, protecting them from apoptotic stimuli,\n\n【69】and are associated with metastatic potential.\n\n【70】Finally, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor stimulate motility of EVT cells through phosphorylation of p42 and p44 MAPKs and the PI3K-dependent proteins, AKT and p38.\n\n【71】Epidermal growth factor-stimulated extravillous cytotrophoblast motility is mediated by the activation of PI3-K, Akt and both p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases.\n\n【72】Epidermal growth factor is associated with tumor cell invasiveness through expression of MMPs.\n\n【73】Switches involved in triggering trophoblast and cancer cell molecular programs for invasion are not completely understood. The Wnt pathway, a system highly conserved across species involved in cellular proliferation and motility, has recently been implicated in switching trophoblast cells from a proliferative to an invasive phenotype.\n\n【74】Activation of the canonical wingless/T-cell factor signaling pathway promotes invasive differentiation of human trophoblast.\n\n【75】Activation of the Wnt pathway is aberrant in many cancers, resulting in escape of β-catenin from proteosomal degradation, with subsequent β-catenin translocation into the cell nucleus and activation of multiple target genes.\n\n【76】Although direct activation of β-catenin alone has shown no effect on motility of EVT cells, inhibition of the Wnt—β-catenin pathway can block blastocyst implantation.\n\n【77】Inactivation of nuclear Wnt-β-catenin signaling limits blastocyst competency for implantation.\n\n【78】In EVT cells, activation of PAR1 (also known as the thrombin receptor) also stabilizes β-catenin and is associated with a proliferative and invasive capacity, whereas application of PAR1-silencing RNA inhibits EVT invasion.\n\n【79】Consistent with the need for tight regulation of invasive trophoblast cells, PAR1 is expressed in EVT cells between the 7th and 10th gestational week but is abruptly shut off by the 12th week.\n\n【80】The pattern of expression of protease-activated receptors (PARs) during early trophoblast development.\n\n【81】Constitutive increased expression of PAR1 can be seen in cancer cells, especially in cells lacking normal p53 activity.\n\n【82】p53 controls hPar1 function and expression.\n\n【83】In vitro assays have shown PAR1 antagonism to inhibit MMP1-induced endothelial cell activation in tumor—endothelial cell communication.\n\n【84】Tumor-derived matrix metalloproteinase-1 targets endothelial proteinase-activated receptor 1 promoting endothelial cell activation.\n\n【85】Whether this system could successfully be targeted for cancer therapy is under investigation. Other signal transduction pathways common in both trophoblast and cancer cell invasion include the JAK-STAT pathway,\n\n【86】FAKs, G proteins, Rho-associated kinase, MAPKs, PI3K, and SMAD family proteins.\n\n【87】All of these pathways represent areas of current anticancer therapeutic development.\n\n【88】As EVTs acquire an invasive phenotype during placental development, they become polyploid (4N-8N) by switching from mitotic division to endoreduplication,\n\n【89】a process in which G2 or M phase (4N) cells replicate DNA without undergoing mitosis. In trophoblast cell lines, polyploid trophoblast giant cells are relatively resistant to the DNA-damaging effects of radiation,\n\n【90】illustrating a mechanism by which survival is promoted in invasive trophoblast cells. This process can also be observed in cancer cells treated with DNA-damaging agents. Endoreduplication can be induced in tumor cells on exposure to genotoxic agents such as paclitaxel\n\n【91】Cell cycle checkpoint efficiency and cellular response to paclitaxel in prostate cancer cells.\n\n【92】and cisplatin; a nonproliferative, senescent state in a small population of cells is induced in the latter case. The polyploid tumor cells can undergo depolyploidization to form diploid, cisplatin-resistant escape cells.\n\n【93】Tumor cells can escape DNA-damaging cisplatin through DNA endoreduplication and reversible polyploidy.\n\n【94】In cells with an impaired p53 system, treatment with the Aurora kinase inhibitor VX-680 leads to endoreduplication followed by apoptosis.\n\n【95】However, in 2 wild-type p53 cancer cell lines, stabilization of p53 by Nutlin-3a, an inhibitor of the p53-binding protein MDM2, leads to initial endoreduplication followed by the emergence of stable radiation- and cisplatin-resistant tetraploid clones.\n\n【96】A better understanding of the EVT endoreduplication process may lead to the development of targeted drugs to maintain tumor cell chemotherapeutic sensitivity.\n\n【97】VASCULOGENIC MIMICRY\n--------------------\n\n【98】As trophoblasts invade maternal spiral arteries, they further differentiate to display a vascular phenotype in a process termed _vasculogenic mimicry_ , in which cells other than endothelial cells form vascular structures.\n\n【99】Human cytotrophoblasts adopt a vascular phenotype as they differentiate: a strategy for successful endovascular invasion?\n\n【100】Vasculogenic mimicry can also be observed in aggressive cancers, and the genes and signaling pathways involved with the process of vasculogenic mimicry may be shared between EVT and cancer cells.\n\n【101】For example, the matrix glycoprotein—binding galectin 3 is highly expressed in EVT cells.\n\n【102】Galectin-3 also appears to be a key factor in the development of an endothelial phenotype and the tube formation well described in aggressive melanomas.\n\n【103】Galectin inhibitors are in preclinical testing as cancer therapeutic agents.\n\n【104】Synthetic inhibitors of galectin-1 and -3 selectively modulate homotypic cell aggregation and tumor cell apoptosis.\n\n【105】Mig-7 was found in circulating tumor cells and tumor tissue (regardless of tissue of origin) from more than 200 patients with cancer; notably, it was absent from healthy controls.\n\n【106】Mig-7 expression is associated with invasion and vasculogenic mimicry in cancer cells and also has recently been demonstrated in invasive embryonic cytotrophoblasts, peaking when EVT cells invade maternal decidua and remodel the vasculature during early placental development.\n\n【107】This finding represents the only known expression of Mig-7 in noncancerous cells. Cancers with an endothelial phenotype have not been shown to be responsive to antiangiogenic therapies.\n\n【108】Effects of angiogenesis inhibitors on vascular network formation by human endothelial and melanoma cells.\n\n【109】Because cancer therapy aimed at proliferating cells is less likely to be effective in invading cells,\n\n【110】galactin-3, Mig-7, and other pathways involved in vasculogenic mimicry may also be important targets for cancer therapy.\n\n【111】ANGIOGENESIS\n------------\n\n【112】Molecular circuits involved in neoangiogenesis separate from vasculogenic mimicry are also likely shared between EVT and tumor cells. Angiopoietins and VEGF family members are extremely important in both spiral artery remodeling in placentation\n\n【113】Localization of angiogenic growth factors and their receptors in the human placental bed throughout normal human pregnancy.\n\n【114】and the growth of many tumor types.\n\n【115】Inhibition of VEGF has become an important therapeutic strategy in many cancers, although resistance can develop,\n\n【116】resulting from the induction of an angiogenic rescue program characterized by the up-regulation of multiple angiogenic genes in hypoxic tumor cells and supporting stroma.\n\n【117】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【118】Anti-PlGF inhibits growth of VEGF(R)-inhibitor-resistant tumors without affecting healthy vessels.\n\n【119】Another member of the VEGF family, PGF, is a part of the VEGF blockade—associated rescue program that is involved in the response to pathologic conditions, such as wounds, ischemia, inflammation, or cancer.\n\n【120】Both VEGF and PGF are highly expressed in trophoblast cells.\n\n【121】It is interesting that serum levels of PGF increase after treatment of patients with cancer with the anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab.\n\n【122】Surrogate markers for antiangiogenic therapy and dose-limiting toxicities for bevacizumab with radiation and chemotherapy: continued experience of a phase I trial in rectal cancer patients \\[letter\\].\n\n【123】Preclinical studies indicate that PGF blockade reduces neoangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, hampers recruitment of intratumoral macrophages, and is not associated with the typical anti-VEGF adverse effects (thrombosis, hypertension, proteinuria, and microvascular pruning) in healthy mice.\n\n【124】Anti-PlGF inhibits growth of VEGF(R)-inhibitor-resistant tumors without affecting healthy vessels.\n\n【125】Also important for angiogenesis is the oxygen-sensitive MTOR pathway.\n\n【126】Central to controlling trophoblast cell proliferation in response to nutrients and growth factors,\n\n【127】MTOR is expressed on the transporting epithelium of intact human placenta.\n\n【128】It is downstream of the PI3K/AKT pathway; controls cell cycle progression and cell size and mass; is involved in angiogenesis via the VEGF, IGF, and HIF-1α—signaling pathways; and is constitutively activated in many malignancies.\n\n【129】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【130】The MTOR inhibitor everolimus has antiangiogenic properties.\n\n【131】mTOR inhibitor RAD001 (everolimus) has antiangiogenic/vascular properties distinct from a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\n【132】A better understanding of the PI3K/AKT/MTOR pathway and other molecular circuits used by trophoblast cells in proliferation, invasion, and endothelial interactions may lead to the development of targeted therapies for cancer.\n\n【133】Overall, we are in our infancy of understanding the complexity, redundancy, and interrelatedness of these molecular pathways in both placentation and neoplasia.\n\n【134】IMMUNOLOGIC PROPERTIES OF THE FETOMATERNAL INTERFACE AND TUMOR MICROENVIRONMENT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【135】In addition to sharing many proliferative and invasive features, the cells of the trophoblast, like cancer cells, actively modulate the host immune response to develop and sustain a nutrient supply. Historically, the placenta was considered an inert, mechanical barrier protecting the semiallogeneic fetus from maternal immunologic attack.\n\n【136】Current evidence, however, supports just the opposite—many maternal and placental immunomodulatory factors are required for adequate placental invasion. Around 40% of decidual cells are cells of the innate immune system (eg, NK cells, macrophages, and DCs), a substantial proportion considering that the uterus is a nonlymphoid organ.\n\n【137】Likewise, although cancer previously has been considered immunologically invisible to the host, many recent studies support the notion that cancer cells actively engage immune cells; for example, the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes has been well described in the literature.\n\n【138】The main components of the maternal immune response at the fetomaternal interface and the similarities to the tumor microenvironment are discussed in the sections that follow.\n\n【139】The most abundant immune cell present at the fetomaternal interface is the uterine NK (uNK) cell, which constitutes approximately 70% of all immune cells found in this tissue.\n\n【140】Recruitment of circulating NK cells through decidual tissues: a possible mechanism controlling NK cell accumulation in the uterus during early pregnancy.\n\n【141】Uterine NK cells are thought to be recruited from peripheral blood when interleukin (IL)-15 is secreted by endometrial stromal cells.\n\n【142】They are distinct from peripheral blood NK cells in that they do not express CD16, the FcRγIIIA receptor required for antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.\n\n【143】The mechanisms associated with this loss of CD16 are unclear but may be related to high levels of TGF-β within the microenvironment.\n\n【144】TGFβ promotes conversion of CD16 <sup>+ </sup> peripheral blood NK cells into CD16- NK cells with similarities to decidual NK cells.\n\n【145】Also, in contrast to peripheral blood NK cells, uNK cells are more immunomodulatory than cytotoxic, secreting galectin 1 to induce tolerogenic DCs\n\n【146】Human decidual natural killer cells are a unique NK cell subset with immunomodulatory potential.\n\n【147】as well as angiogenic factors VEGF and PGF that are important for decidual remodeling.\n\n【148】Decidual NK cells regulate key developmental processes at the human fetal-maternal interface.\n\n【149】An improper balance of cytotoxic to regulatory NK cells could contribute to recurrent miscarriage and pre-eclampsia.\n\n【150】Expression of IL-15 and NK cell infiltration have been reported in many different malignancies,\n\n【151】IFN-γ acts on T cells to induce NK cell mobilization and accumulation in target organs.\n\n【152】including renal cell carcinoma,\n\n【153】Membrane-bound interleukin (IL)-15 on renal tumor cells rescues natural killer cells from IL-2 starvation-induced apoptosis.\n\n【154】with variable prognostic implications. Recently, tumor-infiltrating CD16-NK cells have also been characterized and appear to behave similarly to uNK cells with respect to cytokine production and reduced cytotoxic activity.\n\n【155】Natural killer cells infiltrating human nonsmall-cell lung cancer are enriched in CD56 bright CD16 (-) cells and display an impaired capability to kill tumor cells.\n\n【156】A closer look at factors that determine the balance of killer and regulatory NK cells during pregnancy may help identify mechanisms that shift immunity toward NK cytotoxic activity in patients with cancer.\n\n【157】Also infiltrating the decidua, albeit in smaller numbers than uNK cells, are macrophages, T <sub>reg </sub> , and DCs. Macrophages phagocytose apoptotic EVT cells and secrete IL-10 and IDO, contributing to the tolerogenic T <sub>H </sub> 2 milieu.\n\n【158】Gene expression profiling of decidual macrophages supports an immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory phenotype with higher expression of _CCL18, IGF1, IDO_ , neuropilin 1, and other genes associated with M2-polarized macrophages.\n\n【159】Gene expression profiling of human decidual macrophages: evidence for immunosuppressive phenotype.\n\n【160】Tumor-associated macrophages can be both inflammatory and immunosuppressive, and T <sub>H </sub> 1/T <sub>H </sub> 2 polarization is effected through the activation of NF-κB (also known as NFKB1).\n\n【161】In fact, in vitro studies suggest that tumor-associated macrophages may be re-educated to display a classically activated rather than an M2 phenotype by inhibition of inhibitory kappa B kinase β, the major activator of NF-κB.\n\n【162】“Re-educating” tumor-associated macrophages by targeting NF-κB.\n\n【163】Regulatory T cells are additional important mediators of tolerance in both pregnancy and cancer. Immunophenotypically, these cells express surface CD4, CD25, and FOXP3, and they expand in both decidua\n\n【164】and peripheral blood\n\n【165】during normal pregnancies. This expansion is antigen-specific and is induced by paternal/fetal alloantigens\n\n【166】and not simply by hormonal changes in pregnancy.\n\n【167】Mechanisms of action of regulatory T cells specific for paternal antigens during pregnancy.\n\n【168】A decrease in this lymphocyte subset is associated with spontaneous abortion\n\n【169】and pre-eclampsia.\n\n【170】Distinct subsets of regulatory T cells during pregnancy: is the imbalance of these subsets involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia?\n\n【171】Regulatory T cells are also expanded in cancer and are implicated in impaired antitumor immunity,\n\n【172】suppression of effector T lymphocyte proliferation,\n\n【173】CD4 <sup>+ </sup> CD25 <sup>+ </sup> CD127 (low/-) regulatory T cells express Foxp3 and suppress effector T cell proliferation and contribute to gastric cancers progression.\n\n【174】and increased tumor blood vessel density,\n\n【175】The presence of tumor-infiltrating FOXP3 <sup>+ </sup> lymphocytes correlates with intratumoral angiogenesis in endometrial cancer.\n\n【176】suggesting an important link between immunity and angiogenesis. Regulatory T cells in patients with cancer also recognize tumor-specific antigens and proliferate in response to antigenic stimulation.\n\n【177】Targeting the T <sub>reg </sub> population to boost antitumor immunity is under investigation with agents such as denileukin diftitox (IL2/diphtheria fusion protein) or LMB-2 (Fv fragment of CD25 antibody/ _Pseudomonas_ endotoxin A fusion protein) and CTLA-4 inhibitors.\n\n【178】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【179】Some of the benefit of cytotoxic chemotherapy may be derived from concomitant impairment of the immunosuppressive T <sub>reg </sub> proliferation driven by the cancer.\n\n【180】Antigen-presenting CD83 <sup>+ </sup> DCs are involved in the maintenance of the T <sub>H </sub> 2-predominant state in decidual tissues,\n\n【181】Predominance of Th2-promoting dendritic cells in early human pregnancy decidua.\n\n【182】as well as at other mucosal surfaces.\n\n【183】Human decidua contains potent immunostimulatory CD83 <sup>+ </sup> dendritic cells.\n\n【184】However, the role of the DC is likely more complex than antigen presentation and secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines. Ablation of uterine DCs leads to decidualization failure and embryo resorption in mice; this occurs even with syngeneic pregnancy in mice in which alloantigens are absent.\n\n【185】Uterine DCs are crucial for decidua formation during embryo implantation in mice.\n\n【186】Dendritic cells also represent another link between immunity and angiogenesis, secreting soluble FLT1 (also known as VEGFR1) and TGF-β1 required for endothelial cell survival and vascular maturation. In the absence of DCs, angiogenesis is severely impaired. In cancer, DCs also play a role that is more than immunoregulatory through their production of potent angiogenic growth factors. Moreover, cancer cells can secrete substances that suppress maturation of DCs, including VEGF, TGF-β, hepatocyte growth factor, and osteopontin, thereby maintaining a proangiogenic, immature DC phenotype.\n\n【187】Expression of certain cell surface molecules on both trophoblast and cancer cells can also confer immunologic protection. Among the most important of these molecules is the nonpolymorphic, highly conserved class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules such as HLAG\n\n【188】 in contrast, the highly diverse classical HLA class I proteins A, B, and C are essential in cell-mediated immune responses. In fact, in trophoblast cells, interferon-γ fails to stimulate classical HLA class I expression.\n\n【189】A similar property of down-regulated or absent classical HLA class I expression can cloak cancer cells from the host's immune system.\n\n【190】Cancer treatment modalities including gamma irradiation,\n\n【191】Gamma-radiation upregulates MHC class I/II and ICAM-I molecules in multiple myeloma cell lines and primary tumors.\n\n【192】radiopharmaceutical samarium-153-ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate,\n\n【193】The use of chelated radionuclide (samarium-153-ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonate) to modulate phenotype of tumor cells and enhance T cell-mediated killing.\n\n【194】and chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil\n\n【195】5-fluorouracil derivatives induce differentiation mediated by tubulin and HLA class I modulation.\n\n【196】and hypomethylating agents\n\n【197】Functional up-regulation of human leukocyte antigen class I antigens expression by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine in cutaneous melanoma: immunotherapeutic implications.\n\n【198】increase HLA class I expression.\n\n【199】Expression of HLAG on trophoblast cells and cancer cells has important immunomodulatory effects.

Within the tumor microenvironment, the generation of HLAG <sup>+ </sup> —suppressive NK cells occurs by trogocytosis (ie, the rapid cell-to-cell contact-dependent transfer of membranes and associated molecules from one cell to another), leading to the inhibition of other HLAG <sup>+ </sup> (cross-inhibition) or HLAG <sup>− </sup> NK cells through HLAG and ILT2 cross-linking.\n\n【206】Trogocytosis-based generation of suppressive NK cells.\n\n【207】Expression of HLAG is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders,\n\n【208】HLA-G and lymphoproliferative disorders.\n\n【209】melanoma,\n\n【210】Quantitative HLA-G expression in metastasising and non-metastasising primary thin cutaneous melanomas \\[letter\\].\n\n【211】mesothelioma,\n\n【212】Expression of HLA-G in malignant mesothelioma and clinically aggressive breast carcinoma.\n\n【213】breast carcinoma,\n\n【214】Expression of HLA-G in malignant mesothelioma and clinically aggressive breast carcinoma.\n\n【215】ovarian carcinoma,\n\n【216】HLA-G expression in effusions is a possible marker of tumor susceptibility to chemotherapy in ovarian carcinoma.\n\n【217】renal cell carcinoma,\n\n【218】squamous esophageal cancer,\n\n【219】gastric carcinoma,\n\n【220】cervical cancer,\n\n【221】non—small cell lung cancer,\n\n【222】bladder cancer,\n\n【223】Expression of HLA-G in cancer bladder.\n\n【224】prostate cancer,\n\n【225】endometrial cancer,\n\n【226】colorectal cancer,\n\n【227】and myeloid malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n【228】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【229】Unfavourable clinical implications for HLA-G expression in acute myeloid leukaemia.\n\n【230】However, relatively little is known about the regulation of the expression of this important immunomodulatory molecule.\n\n【231】Regulation of HLAG expression may be at the epigenetic level, with transcription of HLAG being detectable in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine.\n\n【232】Some preliminary evidence also supports a micro-RNA regulatory mechanism.\n\n【233】Clearly, HLAG represents an attractive target for immune-based cancer therapies given its preferential expression in many malignancies as well as limited expression in normal tissues.\n\n【234】The HLA-G gene is expressed at a low mRNA level in different human cells and tissues.\n\n【235】Targeting HLAG with a peptide-based vaccine strategy to develop a cytotoxic T-cell response against tumor cells bearing the molecule has proved feasible,\n\n【236】HLA-G as a target molecule in specific immunotherapy against renal cell carcinoma.\n\n【237】although much work remains before other methods of HLAG inhibition could lead to restoration of antitumor immunity.\n\n【238】Other cell surface tolerance signals common between trophoblasts and cancer cells include CD200 (OX-2) and CEACAM-1.

Implantation of the blastocyst occurs in a T <sub>H </sub> 1-predominant (inflammatory) milieu, but the fetomaternal interface must transition to a T <sub>H </sub> 2-polarized (immunologically tolerant) state for pregnancy to continue (for an excellent review, refer to van Mourik et al\n\n【258】).

We have also verified that these immunomodulatory genes are differentially expressed in melanoma vs benign melanocytic nevi in 2 independent publically available datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information/GenBank GEO database: GSE4587,\n\n【371】which was analyzed on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array platform (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA), and GSE3189,\n\n【372】Novel genes associated with malignant melanoma but not benign melanocytic lesions.\n\n【373】which was analyzed on the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Array Set HG-U133A platform (Affymetrix).

A summary of results is listed in Table 2 . Osteopontin and other important components of innate immunity such as _TLR2_ and _TLR4_ and _PTX3_ were significantly up-regulated in melanoma compared with benign nevi. Galectins 1 and 9 were also significantly up-regulated compared with nevi.

Given what we have learned about the similarities between the placenta and tumor microenvironment, we plan to next comprehensively evaluate changes in systemic immune homeostasis in pregnancy vs cancer in order to prioritize potential therapeutic targets. In particular, identifying immunologic distinctions between pregnancy and cancer will be critical for this process.\n\n【378】TABLE 2 Immunomodulatory Genes Differentially Expressed in Melanoma vs Benign Melanocytic Lesions\n\n【379】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【380】IL-8 = interleukin 8.<mark> For expansion of all gene symbols, see Glossary to Genetics Terminology at the end of the article.</mark>\n\n| Gene symbol | GSE4587 fold change (melanoma vs benign nevi) | _P_ value | GSE3189bGSE3189 used the Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChip and therefore lacked some probes compared with the Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array used by GSE4587.fold change (melanoma vs benign nevi) | _P_ value |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| _SPP1_ | 77.4 | <.001 | 20.3 | <.001 |\n| _IDO_ | 34.7 | <.001 |  |  |\n| _TIMP2_ | 6.5 | <.001 | 3.3 | <.001 |\n| _TLR2_ | 6.0 | <.001 |  |  |\n| _MMP9_ | 5.9 | .003 | 2.5 | <.001 |\n| _IL-8_ | 5.8 | .136 | 3.7 | .007 |\n| _TLR4_ | 6.0 | .018 |  |  |\n| _PTX3_ | 4.4 | .037 |  |  |\n| _MIF_ | 4.1 | .005 | 3.5 | <.001 |\n| _LGALS9_ | 4.1 | .002 |  |  |\n| _LGALS1_ | 3.7 | .004 | 4.1 | <.001 |\n| _LPL_ | 1.4 | .752 | −3.2 | <.001 |\n| _FABP4_ | −2.2 | .615 | −2.3 | .009 |\n| _FZD10_ | −2.9 | .168 | −4.8 | <.001 |\n\n【382】a IL-8 = interleukin 8.

The challenge for investigators in this field will be to extend our observations beyond the T <sub>H </sub> 1/T <sub>H </sub> 2 paradigm in both pregnancy and cancer to a model that can both assess the status and guide treatment of malignancies in an individualized, rational, real-time manner. A critical need exists for the development of treatments aimed at all aspects of cancer: malignant proliferation, invasion, vasculogenic mimicry, angiogenesis, and immune privilege. Studying how all these aspects are orchestrated in the predictable, physiologic process of pregnancy can facilitate the search for novel cancer treatment strategies, from cytotoxic chemotherapy to biologic agents and immunologic adjuncts, in the often unpredictable and arduous fight against the pathologic process of cancer.\n\n【386】### Glossary of Genetics Terminology\n\n【387】_AKT_\n\n【388】v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog\n\n【389】_ALK_\n\n【390】anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase\n\n【391】_BCL2_\n\n【392】B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma 2\n\n【393】_CDK_\n\n【394】cyclin dependent kinase\n\n【395】_CEACAM1_\n\n【396】carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (biliary glycoprotein)\n\n【397】_CMET_ (also known as _MET_ )\n\n【398】met proto-oncogene (hepatocyte growth factor) receptor\n\n【399】_CSF_\n\n【400】colony-stimulating factor\n\n【401】_CSF1R_\n\n【402】CSF type 1 receptor\n\n【403】_CXCR4_\n\n【404】chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 4\n\n【405】_EGF_\n\n【406】epidermal growth factor (beta-urogastrone)\n\n【407】_ERK_\n\n【408】extracellular signal—related kinase\n\n【409】_FABP4_\n\n【410】fatty acid—binding protein 4\n\n【411】_FAK_\n\n【412】focal adhesion kinase\n\n【413】_FAS_\n\n【414】Fas (TNF receptor superfamily, member 6)\n\n【415】_FASL_\n\n【416】FAS ligand\n\n【417】_FCγIIIA_\n\n【418】FC gamma receptor III A\n\n【419】_FGF_\n\n【420】fibroblast growth factor\n\n【421】_FLT1_\n\n【422】fms-related tyrosine kinase 1 (vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor receptor)\n\n【423】_FOXP3_\n\n【424】forkhead box P3\n\n【425】_FZD10_\n\n【426】frizzled homolog 10\n\n【427】_GRO-α_\n\n【428】growth-related oncogene α\n\n【429】_HGF_\n\n【430】hepatocyte growth factor\n\n【431】_HIF-1α_\n\n【432】hypoxia inducible factor 1α\n\n【433】_HSP27_\n\n【434】heat shock protein 27\n\n【435】_IDO_\n\n【436】indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase\n\n【437】_IGF_\n\n【438】insulinlike growth factor\n\n【439】_IGF1R_\n\n【440】IGF type 1 receptor\n\n【441】_ILT2_\n\n【442】Ig-like transcript 2\n\n【443】_JAK_\n\n【444】janus kinase\n\n【445】_LGALS_ 1\n\n【446】galactin 1\n\n【447】_LGALS_ 9\n\n【448】galactin 9\n\n【449】_LPL_\n\n【450】lipoprotein lipase\n\n【451】_MAPK_\n\n【452】mitogen-activated protein kinase\n\n【453】_MCP_ 1\n\n【454】monocyte chemoattractant protein 1\n\n【455】_MEK_ (also known as _MAP2K_ )\n\n【456】MAPK/ERK kinase\n\n【457】_MIF_\n\n【458】macrophage migration inhibitory factor\n\n【459】_Mig-_ 7\n\n【460】migration-induction protein 7\n\n【461】_MDM_ 2\n\n【462】mouse double minute 2\n\n【463】_MMP_\n\n【464】matrix metalloproteinase\n\n【465】_MTOR_\n\n【466】mammalian target of rapamycin\n\n【467】_MUC1_\n\n【468】mucin 1\n\n【469】_NF-κB_\n\n【470】nuclear factor κB\n\n【471】_p38_\n\n【472】tumor protein 38\n\n【473】_PAR1_\n\n【474】protease activated receptor 1\n\n【475】_PDGF_\n\n【476】platelet-derived growth factor\n\n【477】_PDGFR_\n\n【478】PDGF receptor\n\n【479】_PEDF_\n\n【480】pigment epithelial—derived factor\n\n【481】_PGE2_\n\n【482】prostaglandin E2\n\n【483】_PGF_\n\n【484】placental growth factor\n\n【485】_PI3K_\n\n【486】phosphoinositide-3 kinase\n\n【487】_PSG1_\n\n【488】pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 1\n\n【489】_PTX3_\n\n【490】pentraxin 3\n\n【491】_RANTES_ (also known as _CCL5_ )\n\n【492】regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted\n\n【493】_RAF_\n\n【494】v-raf-1 murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1\n\n【495】_RAS_\n\n【496】rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog\n\n【497】_SDF_ (also known as _CXCL12_ )\n\n【498】stromal-derived factor 1\n\n【499】_SPP1_\n\n【500】osteopontin\n\n【501】_STAT_\n\n【502】signal transducers and activator of transcription\n\n【503】_TGF_\n\n【504】transforming growth factor\n\n【505】_TIM3_ (also known as _HAVCR2_ )\n\n【506】T cell immunoglobulin mucin 3\n\n【507】_TIMP2_\n\n【508】tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2\n\n【509】_TLR_\n\n【510】toll-like receptor\n\n【511】_TNF_\n\n【512】tumor necrosis factor\n\n【513】_TRAIL_\n\n【514】TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand\n\n【515】_TRAILR_\n\n【516】TRAIL receptor\n\n【517】_uPA_\n\n【518】urokinase plasminogen activator\n\n【519】_VEGF_\n\n【520】vascular endothelial growth factor\n\n【521】_VEGFR_\n\n【522】VEGF receptor\n\n【523】_waf1/cip1_ (also known as _CDKN1A_ )\n\n【524】cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A\n\n【525】_Wnt_\n\n【526】wingless/T-cell factor\n\n【527】_XIAP_\n\n【528】X-link inhibitor of apoptosis protein\n\n【529】Author Interview\n----------------\n\n【530】Interview with Dr. Shernan Holtan", "index": 61553, "show": true, "start": 61514, "end": 61641, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:03:02", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:07:31", "cost": 268.336}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:34", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:07:31", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:03:02"}

Adults with diabetes (type 1, 2, or subtypes such as latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood) assessed three randomly selected vignettes among 36 that combined different modalities for monitoring tools (three options: glucose- and physical activity \\[PA\\]–monitoring only, or glucose- and PA-monitoring with occasional or regular food monitoring), duration/feedback loops (six options: monitoring for a week before all vs before specific consultations with feedback given in consultation, vs monitoring permanently, with real-time feedback by one's physician vs by anoter caregiver, vs monitoring permanently, with real-time, artificial intelligence-generated treatment feedback vs treatment and lifestyle feedback), and data handling (two options: by the public vs private sector). We compared intrusiveness (assessed on a 5-point scale) across vignettes and used linear mixed models to identify intrusiveness determinants. We collected qualitative data to identify aspects that drove participants’ perception of intrusiveness.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Overall, 1010 participants from 30 countries provided 2860 vignette-assessments (52% were type 1 diabetes). The monitoring modalities associated with increased intrusiveness were food monitoring compared with glucose- and PA-monitoring alone (β=0.34; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.42; _P_ <.001) and permanent monitoring with real-time physician-generated feedback compared with monitoring for a week with feedback in consultation (β=0.25; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.34, _P_ <.001). Public-sector data handling was associated with decreased intrusiveness as compared with private-sector (β=−0.15; 95% CI, −0.22 to −0.09; _P_ <.001). Four drivers of intrusiveness emerged from the qualitative analysis: practical/psychosocial burden (eg, RDM attracting attention in public), control, data safety/misuse, and dehumanization of care.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】RDM is intrusive when it includes food monitoring, real-time human feedback, and private-sector data handling.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】AI ( artificial intelligence ), PA ( physical activity ), RDM ( remote digital monitoring )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 17:33:18", "endTime": "2024/08/26 17:35:49", "cost": 150.918}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:34", "update_time": "2024-08-26 01:35:49", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 01:33:18"}

Unfortunately, translating these into effective public health interventions has been— at best—uneven. Although the pandemic still rages, many are discussing how and when to reopen businesses, society, and economies. These decisions must be informed in a science-based understanding of how control of the pandemic can be achieved.\n\n【1】A basic principle of understanding the spread infectious diseases is the concept of infectious dose 50 (ID <sub>50 </sub> ) or the number of pathogens (in this case, number of SARS-CoV-2 viruses) that causes infection in 50% of those persons who are exposed. The ID <sub>50 </sub> for a given pathogen depends on the basic reproduction number (R <sub>0 </sub> , or the expected number of cases directly generated by 1 case) and host susceptibility. Those variables are not static; for example, the B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom) variant of SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have a higher R <sub>0 </sub> than the original SARS-CoV-2 strains. The number of human conditions that appear to affect host susceptibility to infection (for example, diabetes, obesity, and intrinsic errors in type 1 interferon signaling pathways) continues to grow as the outbreak continues. Although those variables may explain, in part, heterogeneity in disease outcomes on an individual basis, within large populations, they are generally stable, and understanding their influence can inform policy for reopening of societies.\n\n【2】Implicit in the concept of ID <sub>50 </sub> , is the understanding that if the number of pathogens is greater than ID <sub>50 </sub> , more hosts will become infected, and if the number of pathogens is less than ID <sub>50 </sub> , fewer hosts will become infected. In other words, infectious rates follow a dose-response relationship.\n\n【3】In the case of SARS-CoV-2, at least 5 lines of evidence suggest that infection follows that dose-response relationship. In vivo models of infection, with closely related coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and murine coronavirus strain, 1 exhibit dose responsiveness.\n\n【4】The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection following exposure to an infected person is inversely proportional to proximity of exposure, and recovery of droplets in the environment decreases with increasing distance, according to Stoke’s law.\n\n【5】Physical distancing, face masks, and eye protection to prevent person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【6】Efficacy of respiratory transmission of SARS-CoV-2, estimated by modeling, indicates that risk decreases both with increasing room size and increased frequency of air changes per hour,\n\n【7】consistent with a dose-response effect. Clinical success of antiviral agents for SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that treatment success is associated with reduced viral load.\n\n【8】Effect of bamlanivimab as monotherapy or in combination with etesevimab on viral load in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial.\n\n【9】Higher viral loads, as measured by cycle threshold values, are associated with increased infectiousness in cell-culture models.\n\n【10】Viral RNA load as determined by cell culture as a management tool for discharge of SARS-CoV-2 patients from infectious disease wards.\n\n【11】The practical significance of SARS-CoV-2 following a dose-response relationship is seen at 2 levels: first in terms of symptoms and second in terms of transmissibility . Emerging data suggest that higher SARS-CoV-2 viral loads are associated with worsened severity of disease,\n\n【12】Viral dynamics in mild and severe cases of COVID-19.\n\n【13】which align with previous observations that disease is more severe with higher viral loads in cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus infections. Congruently, asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 appear to be less efficient at transmitting SARS-CoV-2,\n\n【14】possibly because of reduced viral loads but also likely as a result of fewer symptoms, by definition, in asymptomatic persons. Because the symptoms of COVID-19 (coughing, in particular), increase effective droplet spread, fewer symptomatic cases translate to fewer droplets produced at or above the ID <sub>50 </sub> over shorter distances.\n\n【15】Figure 1 Exposure of humans to the SARS-CoV-2 virus may result in 1 of 3 outcomes: persons who are exposed but uninfected (left), infected but asymptomatic (top middle), or infected with severe disease (right). The amount of virus in these different hosts varies: with no virus in uninfected hosts, high amounts of virus (viral load) in severely ill hosts, or detectable but less virus in infected asymptomatic hosts. The risk that these individuals pose to spreading the virus—or the infectivity of these hosts—varies in parallel. Early diagnosis and treatment (green) of asymptomatic infected hosts reduces the viral load and infectivity of these hosts and renders the majority uninfected. Early diagnosis and treatment of severely ill hosts—when successful—renders treated individuals less symptomatic or uninfected, and the viral load in these subjects reduces, and their risk of spreading infection reduces in parallel. Recovery from infection—or receipt of a vaccine—generates acquired immunity (yellow), and this makes an exposed person more likely to remain uninfected or, if infected, to be asymptomatic as opposed to severely ill.\n\n【16】It is good news that SARS-CoV-2 follows a dose response because any intervention that reduces virus copy number in infected hosts—or reduces the proportion of exposed persons who shed virus—will also reduce viral spread within populations. Knowing this, how can societies control the spread of the pandemic maximally? We posit that the following 3 interventions will be required in concert to achieve maximal control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\n\n【17】Acquired Immunity\n-----------------\n\n【18】SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in humans have been shown to reduce the incidence of symptomatic infections by as much as 95%. Less is known about the impact of such vaccines of SARS-CoV-2 viral loads and consequent shedding. Rhesus macaques vaccinated with Ad26, then challenged with high-dose SARS-CoV-2, were followed for disease and viral load; vaccinated monkeys had fewer symptoms, less pathology, and greatly reduced viral loads (>3.0 log reductions) in both bronchoalveolar lavage samples and nasopharyngeal swabs.\n\n【19】SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a cohort of 43,000 antibody-positive individuals followed for up to 35 weeks. _medRxiv_ .\n\n【20】Humans vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine, and prospectively monitored for proportion that shed virus by nasopharyngeal swab, showed that even a single dose of vaccine reduced viral shedding by 67%.\n\n【21】Single-dose administration and the influence of the timing of the booster dose on immunogenicity and efficacy of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222) vaccine: a pooled analysis of four randomised trials.\n\n【22】Thus, vaccination is very likely to reduce transmission, and early evidence supports that contention in a large population-based study in Israel.\n\n【23】One of the enigmas of understanding immune-mediated protection is the concept of immune correlates of protection, or which element of the immune response is associated with protection from disease. An extreme example is seen with prophylactic HIV vaccines; most vaccines tested generate robust immune responses of virtually any immune element assessed, but few, if any, confer protection against disease. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, monoclonal antispike antibodies alone are sufficient to prevent human infection,\n\n【24】SARS-CoV-2 Neutralizing antibody LY-CoV555 in outpatients with Covid-19.\n\n【25】demonstrating de facto that 1 immune correlate of protection is antibody. That, in turn, informs our understanding of the protection conferred after recovery from natural infection. Recent data demonstrate that although antibody levels decay over time in recovered patients with a half-life of ∼83 days, memory B cells, including those producing receptor-binding domain antibodies, increase over the first 4 to 5 months postinfection, strongly suggesting that natural infection produces lasting immunity to reinfection.\n\n【26】Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection.\n\n【27】Indeed, although reinfections with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, the rate of infection in subjects who are seropositive as a result of natural infection is significantly less than in seronegatives.\n\n【28】Antibody status and incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in health care workers.\n\n【29】Accordingly, recovery from natural infection, affects disease susceptibility and will contribute to control of the pandemic.\n\n【30】Public Health Interventions\n---------------------------\n\n【31】For most of the pandemic, without a vaccine and with limited treatment options, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) have been the backbone of the response. These are public health interventions that reduce exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and, based on the dose-response principle, reduce infections and subsequent transmission. Analyses have shown efforts that reduce crowds by canceling public events and limiting private gatherings reduced rates of infection, as did restrictions on schools and workplaces.\n\n【32】However, for these to be effective, the population has to adhere to the measures meticulously. Compliance with NPIs has reduced over time, and the impact of enacting and discontinuing them can lag for weeks, leading to the “seesaw” pattern of infections seen last year. As the impact of NPIs becomes increasingly apparent, it is critical to maintain this jointly with the other interventions described.\n\n【33】Treatment as Prevention\n-----------------------\n\n【34】The concept of treatment as control reached maturity in the HIV epidemic, and we now know, definitively, that identifying and treating patients for HIV reduces the ability of an infected person to spread infection.\n\n【35】So, too, this is likely the case for SARS-CoV-2. Returning to the concept of infectiousness operating on a dose-response curve, and given that treatments with remdesivir and spike monoclonal antibodies reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load, early and effective treatments are likely to reduce the ability of infected persons to spread virus by 2 means: by implementing quarantine and other isolation interventions and by reducing the viral load in treated persons, thereby reducing their ability to spread virus .\n\n【36】Figure 2 Maximal control of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will require a synergy of the effects of early diagnosis and treatment, public health interventions such as masking and social distancing, and the acquisition of immunity across a broad spectrum of society.\n\n【37】The remarkable development of accurate diagnostics, effective therapies, and preventive vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 have positioned societies to think about reopening; however, to be safe and effective, we propose an approach that maximizes the synergy of the 3 individually successful interventions of early diagnosis and treatment, public health interventions, and acquired immunity. Once control is achieved—defined as a low steady state of new infections—it might then be possible to consider relaxing of behavioral interventions such as masking.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:26:31", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:26:59", "cost": 27.767}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:33", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:26:59", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:26:31"}

During ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, postprandial decreases in blood pressure were noted in 83% of the OH group, supine or sleep hypertension in 84%, and noncompensatory heart rate variability in 75%. Findings on autonomic testing were abnormal in 99% of patients, serum creatinine value was increased in 30%, proteinuria was present in 27%, and left ventricular hypertrophy was present in 20%.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】Orthostatic hypotension is present in a heterogeneous group of disease states, is usually symptomatic, and is often associated with an abnormal blood pressure profile of reversal of circadian pattern, postprandial hypotension, and noncompensatory heart rate variability.

He had a 10-week history of worsening pain in his left toes. His mother was present during the initial history taking and reported progressive blackening of the third and fourth toes during the past 4 weeks. Four days before admission, a physician at a hospital elsewhere noted a pustule on the base of the third toe and erythema of the foot and initiated ciprofloxacin therapy. On admission, the patient rated the pain in his left foot as an 8 on a 10-point scale; he was able to obtain substantial pain relief through dependent positioning. He had been healthy until age 29 years, at which time he noted right foot numbness while playing tennis. At that time, lower-extremity arterial thrombi of unclear etiology were noted, and the patient underwent right anterior tibial and bilateral femoral artery thrombectomy. Surgical details were not readily available; however, the patient stated that after surgery he started taking the phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol (for lower extremity claudication) and began receiving long-term warfarin therapy with excellent international normalized ratio control.\n\n【1】*   1.\n\n【2】    _Given the initial history and findings on examination, which one of the following admitting diagnoses is least likely?_\n\n【3】    *   a.\n\n【4】        _Diabetes mellitus_\n\n【5】    *   b.\n\n【6】        _Warfarin-induced necrosis_\n\n【7】    *   c.\n\n【8】        _Primary vasculitic disease_\n\n【9】    *   d.\n\n【10】        _Embolic disease_\n\n【11】    *   e.\n\n【12】        _Traumatic injury_\n\n【13】Given the limited history, the admission differential should be kept broad. Diabetes mellitus should be investigated as an etiology because it is a common cause of foot ulcers and necrotic digits. Ulceration in diabetes is secondary to a mixture of ischemic and neuropathic components. Warfarin-induced necrosis, a rare adverse reaction, is most common in the first few days of warfarin therapy and is associated with administration of a large initial dose of the drug.\n\n【14】The patient's long-term warfarin therapy and well-controlled international normalized ratio make this the least likely diagnosis. Primary vasculitic diseases, such as giant cell arteritis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, microscopic polyangiitis, thromboangiitis obliterans, and polyarteritis nodosa, are causes of arterial insufficiency and would be consistent with the findings in this patient. Also supportive of arterial insufficiency was the pain relief achieved while the limb was in a dependent position. Embolic disease can cause distal ischemia, and embolic sources, such as those associated with atherosclerosis, should be further investigated. Traumatic injury should also be included in the admitting differential, especially given that a previous event occurred during exercise.\n\n【15】Further history was obtained to focus the differential diagnosis. The patient denied recent trauma to the lower extremities, fever, chills, and rigors and stated that he otherwise felt well. Other than ciprofloxacin, cilostazol, and warfarin, his only medications were ibuprofen and oxycodone-acetaminophen as needed for pain. The patient had a 15-pack-year smoking history but denied smoking since his numbness when he was age 29 years. He denied any other remarkable medical history relevant to this case.\n\n【16】On admission, the patient had a temperature of 37.2ϒC, blood pressure of 121/79 mm Hg, and a pulse of 78 beats/min. On examination, he appeared athletic and in no distress. Findings on cardiac and pulmonary examinations were normal. Radial pulses were strong and symmetric. The feet were warm, but posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses were absent bilaterally. Nonpitting edema (2+) was noted on the left side of the foot, extending to the ankle. Ulceration is depicted in Figure 1 . The patient preferred the dependent position for his left foot and was unable to elevate it for more than a minute without severe pain. No duskiness was noted. His foot displayed a well-demarcated area of erythema with associated warmth and swelling, consistent with cellulitis. According to the patient, these changes were not resolving.\n\n【17】*   2.\n\n【18】    _On hospital admission, which one of the following antimicrobial medications would be most appropriate?_\n\n【19】    *   a.\n\n【20】        _Ciprofloxacin (continued)_\n\n【21】    *   b.\n\n【22】        _Cefazolin_\n\n【23】    *   c.\n\n【24】        _Piperacillin-tazobactam_\n\n【25】    *   d.\n\n【26】        _Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin_\n\n【27】    *   e.\n\n【28】        _Piperacillin-tazobactam, vancomycin, and fluconazole_\n\n【29】FIGURE 1 Patient's left foot, showing blackening of the third and fourth toes.\n\n【30】To prevent worsening of disease while further evaluation and diagnostic tests are performed, appropriate choice of antimicrobial medication is crucial. Given the progression of the patient's foot infection despite 4 days of ciprofloxacin therapy, antibiotic coverage should be broadened. Furthermore, continued fluoroquinolone use could complicate anticoagulation management. Cefazolin is often used for cellulitis because of its excellent gram-positive coverage; however, it does not provide the broad-spectrum coverage needed in this case for potential polymicrobial infection. Furthermore, severe foot infections require pseudomonal coverage. Piperacillin-tazobactam provides excellent gram-positive, anaerobic, and gram-negative coverage, including _Pseudomonas_ species. However, given the severity of the infection and the increasing prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus,_\n\n【31】vancomycin is also warranted. Because this patient has no evidence of compromised immunity or specific features to suggest a fungal infection, antifungal coverage with fluconazole is unnecessary.\n\n【32】Findings on blood cultures, drawn at admission, were negative after 5 days. On the basis of the appearance of the foot, magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate for osteomyelitis. The patient was initially unable to keep his leg elevated for the scan because of pain and required sedation to tolerate the imaging study. Results were worrisome, suggesting osteomyelitis. Further medical evaluation consisted of screening for common causes of vascular insufficiency. Findings on evaluation for diabetes were unremarkable. An autoimmune disease assessment (antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, antiphospholipid antibodies, cryoglobulins, and hepatitis screen) and coagulopathy evaluation (protein C and S levels, activated protein C resistance, and prothrombin mutations) yielded negative results. The patient's serum homocysteine level was not checked.\n\n【33】*   3.\n\n【34】    _Which one of the following is the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation and management?_\n\n【35】    *   a.\n\n【36】        _Amputation of the foot_\n\n【37】    *   b.\n\n【38】        _Sural nerve biopsy_\n\n【39】    *   c.\n\n【40】        _Fat pad aspiration_\n\n【41】    *   d.\n\n【42】        _Distal nerve blockade with lidocaine/epinephrine_\n\n【43】    *   e.\n\n【44】        _Angiography_\n\n【45】Although amputation of the foot may be necessary at a later point in this patient's management given the finding of probable osteomyelitis, it is not the best choice at this time because further work-up and diagnostic evaluation to determine a cause are needed first. Sural nerve biopsy can be useful in detection of many systemic disorders that can lead to foot ischemia and peripheral neuropathy, including diabetes and rheumatoid vasculitis. However, given an unremarkable diabetes work-up and normal results on autoimmune studies, the yield of sural nerve biopsy would be low. Indeed, indications for sural nerve biopsy are dwindling.\n\n【46】Fat pad aspiration is an invasive diagnostic study for evaluation of amyloidosis. Amyloidosis, which typically presents with diffuse, multiorgan involvement, would not be likely in this patient with localized limb ischemia. Although pain control is an important part of management of foot ischemia, administration of lidocaine and epinephrine is inappropriate in this case. Infections create an acidic environment, which complicates dosing of local anesthetics given a predilection for ionization at lower pH. Epinephrine can also lead to further vascular compromise in a distal extremity, worsening the ischemia. Angiography is appropriate to further evaluate for vasculitic etiologies of arterial insufficiency.\n\n【47】Lower-extremity arteriography revealed diffuse medium-to-small vessel disease, worse on the left, consistent with vasculitis . Specifically, the angiogram depicts obliteration of the left anterior and posterior tibial arteries.\n\n【48】*   4.\n\n【49】    _Given the findings on arteriographic study, which one of the following would be the most appropriate next step in evaluation and management?_\n\n【50】    *   a.\n\n【51】        _Place an inferior vena cava filter_\n\n【52】    *   b.\n\n【53】        _Perform aortofemoral bypass surgery_\n\n【54】    *   c.\n\n【55】        _Readdress smoking history_\n\n【56】    *   d.\n\n【57】        _Perform exercise electrocardiography_\n\n【58】    *   e.\n\n【59】        _Initiate clopidogrel_\n\n【60】FIGURE 2 Lower-extremity arteriogram showing diffuse medium-to-small vessel disease, worse on the left.\n\n【61】Inferior vena cava filter placement is performed in patients with lower-extremity venous thrombosis who demonstrate either failure of or contraindications to anticoagulation. It is not appropriate in the setting of arterial diseasewith no evidence of venous thrombus. Aortofemoral bypass surgery would be a reasonable choice for large-vessel arterial disease. However, the angiogram shows medium-to-small vessel disease; thus aortofemoral bypass is not indicated. Readdressing the smoking history, particularly given that the original history was obtained in the presence of the patient's mother, is the best choice given the findings consistent with thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease). Additional discussion with the patient yielded a different history than previously obtained. Although cardiac evaluation should be pursued in patients with arterial disease, this patient would not be a candidate for exercise electrocardiography because of lower-extremity infection and pain. Clopidogrel, a platelet inhibitor that irreversibly blocks the adenosine diphosphate receptor on platelet cell membranes, is used for prevention of ischemia in patients with atherosclerotic disease. However, the angiogram shows evidence of vasculitis, not atherosclerotic disease, and thus clopidogrel therapy is not indicated.\n\n【62】When his mother was not present, the patient admitted that he had been smoking intermittently after his thrombectomy but denied other drug use. Given this additional history, Buerger disease was established as a working diagnosis.\n\n【63】*   5.\n\n【64】    _Which one of the following, if established, would greatly increase the likelihood of the presumed diagnosis?_\n\n【65】    *   a.\n\n【66】        _Lack of response to nitroprusside_\n\n【67】    *   b.\n\n【68】        _Consistent arteriographic findings in noninvolved limbs_\n\n【69】    *   c.\n\n【70】        _Subungual hemorrhage_\n\n【71】    *   d.\n\n【72】        _Family history of disease_\n\n【73】    *   e.\n\n【74】        _Elevated sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels_\n\n【75】Although endothelium-dependent relaxation is impaired in patients with Buerger disease, non-endothelium-dependent mechanisms appear to be intact\n\n【76】 thus, results of nitroprusside administration are not diagnostic for Buerger disease. Consistent arteriographic findings in clinically involved and noninvolved limbs are an essential feature of thromboangiitis obliterans.\n\n【77】Subungual hemorrhage would be consistent with endocarditis, not Buerger disease, and is less likely in this patient who has no systemic symptoms and negative results on blood cultures. Buerger disease does have an increased predominance among Ashkenazi Jews and represents a higher proportion of peripheral arterial disease in those of Korean, Japanese, and Indian descent\n\n【78】 however, family history is not an established risk factor. Unlike many other forms of vasculitis, acute phase reactants, such as sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels, are typically normal in Buerger disease; however, this phenomenon is not diagnostic.\n\n【79】The patient was also found to have small-vessel disease of the hand on arteriographic study despite normal radial and ulnar pulses, capillary refill, and extremity warmth, as well as negative results on Allen test. Given these findings and an otherwise negative work-up, Buerger disease was suspected.\n\n【80】When the subject of smoking cessation was addressed, the patient insisted that he would never smoke again. He was offered below-the-knee amputation, which he refused. Intermittent pneumatic pump therapy, the treatment of choice in patients unable to undergo revascularization,\n\n【81】was initiated. The patient was dismissed on hospital day 7 with a Rooke boot, an intermittent pneumatic pump, a peripherally inserted central catheter for continued antibiotic therapy, low-molecular-weight heparin for at least 4 weeks, morphine for pain control, and close follow-up.\n\n【82】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【83】Buerger disease is an episodic, nonatherosclerotic, segmental vascular disease of small- and medium-sized arteries that typically affects multiple limbs and is triggered by tobacco exposure.\n\n【84】Buerger disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, and diabetes mellitus, autoimmune diseases, hypercoagulable states, and embolic disease must first be ruled out.\n\n【85】In general, Buerger disease manifests in people younger than 45 years who currently use tobacco or have a history of recent tobacco use and distal-extremity ischemia.\n\n【86】Smoking history is an important feature in Buerger disease; however, the amount of tobacco use is not necessarily a marker of disease. Indeed, environmental tobacco smoke has been reported to lead to exacerbation,\n\n【87】and even smokeless tobacco has been associated with the disease.\n\n【88】Furthermore, cannabis arteritis is thought by some to represent a form of the disease.\n\n【89】The relationship between tobacco and disease progression remains unclear. Given the strong tie between substance use and the etiology and progression of Buerger disease, a common misconception that smoking cessation is futile has emerged; in fact, no consensus has been reached in the literature on this point.\n\n【90】Regardless, smoking cessation is of clinical benefit and should be actively pursued in patients with thromboangiitis obliterans. An accurate tobacco history is valuable in patient assessment because smoking cessation remains the primary treatment of Buerger disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:09:04", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:09:45", "cost": 41.258}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:33", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:09:45", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:09:03"}

The purpose of this work is to propose a conceptual framework for understanding UPOU that posits the influence of 3 principal domains that include the characteristics of (1) individual patients, (2) the practice environment, and (3) opioid prescribers. Although no standardized method exists for developing a conceptual framework, the process often involves identifying corroborative evidence, leveraging expert opinion to identify factors for inclusion in the framework, and developing a graphic depiction of the relationships between the various factors and the clinical problem of interest. Key patient characteristics potentially associated with UPOU include (1) medical and mental health conditions; (2) pain etiology; (3) individual affective, behavioral, and neurophysiologic reactions to pain and opioids; and (4) sociodemographic factors. Also, UPOU could be influenced by structural and health care policy factors: (1) the practice environment, including the roles of prescribing clinicians, adoption of relevant practice guidelines, and clinician incentives or disincentives, and (2) the regulatory environment. Finally, characteristics inherent to clinicians that could influence prescribing practices include (1) training in pain management and opioid use; (2) personal attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs regarding the risks and benefits of opioids; and (3) professionalism. As the gatekeeper to opioid access, the behavior of prescribing clinicians directly mediates UPOU, with the 3 domains interacting to determine this behavior. This proposed conceptual framework could guide future research on the topic and allow plausible hypothesis-based interventions to reduce UPOU.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviation:\n\n【3】UPOU ( unintended prolonged opioid use )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:00:26", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:02:12", "cost": 106.121}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:33", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:02:11", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:00:24"}

Several studies have indicated that a total daily intake of 25 g of soy protein paired with a low-fat diet resulted in clinically important reductions of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. Soybeans are a rich source of isoflavones, a class of phytoestrogens found predominantly in legumes and beans. Soy isoflavones are heterocyclic phenols with structural similarity to estradiol-17β and selective estrogen receptor modulators. Actions at the cellular level depend on the target tissue, receptor status of the tissue, and the level of endogenous estrogen. Studies of soy-based diets evaluating the relation between soy consumption and serum lipid concentrations revealed that soy consumption significantly decreased total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. However, the soy isoflavones do not increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglyceride levels. The effects of soy protein on other target tissues reflect estrogenlike agonist and antagonist effects. Epidemiological studies suggest a protective effect of soy protein on breast tissue as evidenced by the lower rates of breast cancer in East Asian countries where soy is a predominant part of the diet. Data available from human studies on the effect of isoflavones on osteoporosis are limited, and additional studies are needed to support a role in osteoporosis prevention. Thus far, there is no evidence for a stimulatory effect of isoflavones on the endometrium. A few studies reveal a minimal effect of soy on hot flashes, with soy reducing hot flashes 45% and placebo causing a 30% re duction compared with an approximate 70% reduction in hot flashes with estrogen replacement therapy. Evidence from laboratory studies reveals neither a positive nor a negative effect of soy isoflavones on cognition. To date, no adverse effects of short- or long-term use of soy proteins are known in humans. The only adverse effects known are those reported in animals (infertility in sheep and quails grazing on phytoestrogen-rich pastures). In conclusion, soy isoflavones are biologically active compounds. Current data are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions regarding the use of isoflavones as an alternative to estrogen for hormone replacement in postmenopausal women. Although epidemiological and basic laboratory studies allude to the possible protective effects of soy isoflavones at specific target tissues, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials are necessary to address these important issues.\n\n【1】CHAT ( choline acetyltransferase ), DES ( diethylstilbestrol ), ER ( estrogen receptor ), ERT ( estrogen replacement therapy ), FSH ( follicle-stimulating hormone ), HDL ( high-density lipoprotein ), LDL ( low-density lipoprotein ), LH ( luteinizing hormone ), SERM ( selective estrogen receptor modulator ), SHBG ( sex hormone-binding globulin ), UVR ( ultraviolet ray )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:36:00", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:36:10", "cost": 10.011}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:33", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:36:09", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:35:59"}

Their sons, Yoshihiro Takaki and William James Mayo, evolved their friendship into a long-lasting medical interchange between the 2 institutions. In this vignette, we recount their stories and journeys around the globe.\n\n【1】About Kanehiro Takaki\n---------------------\n\n【2】Dr Kanehiro Takaki is one of the most prestigious physicians in the Japanese medical history. He studied at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School in London from 1875 to 1880. Upon return to Japan, he founded a private hospital and medical school with the mission to serving the poor, which later became the Jikei University School of Medicine. His academic contribution is best known for identification of the cause of beriberi (Kakke, in Japanese) as a nutritional deficiency in 1884, preceding the isolation of vitamin B <sub>1 </sub> by 40 years. He led an experiment in which naval soldiers on a training ship were given a Western-style food instead of a rice-based diet, which reduced the incidence of beriberi by 90% during the voyage.\n\n【3】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【4】He was named the Surgeon General of the Japanese Imperial Navy in 1885 and ennobled with the title of Baron for his work on beriberi in 1905. He set out to travel around the globe in 1906. On route, he gave 3 lectures on his study on beriberi at St Thomas's Hospital, which were published in the _Lancet_ .\n\n【5】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【6】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【7】Mayo Clinic and the Surgeons Club\n---------------------------------\n\n【8】Dr William Worrall Mayo (W.W. Mayo) established a private practice in Rochester, which later evolved into Mayo Clinic. By 1906, Mayo Clinic was already an epicenter of medicine, and countless physicians around the world visited Rochester to observe the surgical expertise of his 2 sons, William James Mayo (W.J. Mayo) and Charles Horace Mayo. The Mayo brothers were at the peak of their surgical careers and proliferative authors in national medical journals.\n\n【9】On June 7, 1906, 6 doctors visiting Mayo Clinic assembled in a room of the Cook House and founded the Surgeons Club.\n\n【10】In a short time, this medical community became a popular travel destination for an international audience of medical professionals.\n\n【11】Kanehiro Takaki and W.W. Mayo\n-----------------------------\n\n【12】After the lectures at St Thomas's Hospital in London, Baron Takaki traveled to New York, Canada, and then arrived in Rochester. On June 18, 1906, within 2 weeks of the inception of the Surgeon Club, he joined it with his eldest son, Yoshihiro, who was also a physician and had studied at St Thomas's Hospital Medical School.\n\n【13】They delivered a speech on beriberi and were awarded a life membership to the club. He was invited to W.W. Mayo's house on June 18 as noted in his handwritten diary . The next day, a reception was held at the Cook House. Baron Takaki and his son were hosted by Dr Thompson of Edinburgh, Scotland, along with Dr and Mrs W.J. Mayo and their daughters.\n\n【14】Figure 1 Kanehiro Takaki's handwritten diary. An excerpt reads, “On June 18, I arrived in Rochester, and I was invited by Dr. Mayo, my acquaintance, to his house. I stayed there through June 23 and benefited so much from closely observing Mayo brothers' unparalleled teaching at the hospital.”\n\n【15】删除21:<u>W.W. Mayo repaid his visit by traveling to Japan in 1907 when he was 89. Baron Takaki welcomed him royally and gave him a reception at Seiyoken in Ueno, Tokyo, on May 19, 1907.</u>\n\n【16】The hospitality of Japanese people during the 2-month trip, including a visit to Yokohama and Kobe, impressed W.W. Mayo profoundly. After returning to Rochester, Dr Mayo recounted his experience in Japan in the newspaper\n\n【17】: “It seems as if I had been in a wonderland. I've been among new peoples; have seen new ways of doing things; have walked in a world that is practically upside down when compared with our little world.” A photo of the 2 with Baroness Takaki and others, taken during the visit, signifies the bond between them .\n\n【18】Figure 2 A photo of Kanehiro Takaki and W.W. Mayo. The Japanese person sitting with W.W. Mayo was long unidentified. He was recently identified as Kanehiro Takaki by a staff of the Jikei University School of Medicine during a group visit of Japanese medical school staff to Mayo Clinic. This photo was taken during Dr Mayo's trip to Japan in 1907. W.W. Mayo is on the front left and Baron Takaki on the front right. The lady standing on the left is Tomi, wife of Baron Takaki.\n\n【19】Friendship Between Yoshihiro Takaki and W.J. Mayo\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【20】Baron Takaki's eldest son, Yoshihiro, was also ennobled with the title of Baron and later became the president of the Jikei University School of Medicine. He maintained friendship with W.J. Mayo for a long time through correspondence since his visit to Rochester. It was evident in the letters that both physicians highly respected each other. This friendship led to a visit of the Japanese Medical Commission at Mayo Clinic in 1923. The commission consisted of Yoshihiro Takaki and other prominent Japanese physicians, and they came to Mayo Clinic at the invitation of the Rockefeller Foundation . They spent 4 days, from April 28 to May 1, visiting Mayo Clinic, the Mayo Foundation, and affiliated hospitals. They were entertained at a dinner at the University Club on May 1. The address of welcome at the dinner by W.J. Mayo emphasized their friendship as unified professionals dedicated to the patient, irrespective of political and commercial conflicts between Japan and the United States during that time .\n\n【21】…We meet not as Japanese and Americans but as members of a learned profession whose lives are given to the prevention of sickness, to the relief of human ills, and to these researches which will lessen human misery in the future…\n\n【22】Figure 3 A photo of Yoshihiro Takaki and W.J.

Most patients (85%) in our community have ADs in their medical records at the time of death. Thus, we typically know, early on, if organ donation is an option for a particular critically ill patient. Although our AD does not have a statement about willingness to be supported for the purpose of organ donation, we have never had an instance wherein a patient's AD created a conflict with referral and evaluation for organ donation. Our policy on donation after cardiac death started in 1999 and is the oldest in Wisconsin and perhaps in the United States. Within an hour of a patient's fulfilling one of the clinical triggers, the Donor Resource Team is called to assist in evaluation for organ donation. This occurs before the deceleration of care or removal of support and happens before the discussion of organ donation with the next of kin. For potential donors who are not already receiving life support, good care dictates discussing with the family the possibility of using life-support systems once one of the clinical triggers is met.\n\n【2】Our system works, and we consistently have one of the highest organ donation rates (number of patients who actually provide organs for transplant divided by the number of patients who meet the criteria for making them medically eligible to donate) in the United States. The organ donation rates in 2006 for our institution and nationally were 81% and 60%, respectively.

He denied having fever, hematuria, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss.\n\n【1】The patient's medical history was notable for recurrent nephrolithiasis for which hydrochlorothiazide was prescribed and psoriasis, which was well controlled with Goeckerman treatment. Surgical history included nasal polypectomy and orchiopexy for cryptorchidism.\n\n【2】The patient's vital signs on admission included a temperature of 37.4°C, regular heart rate of 78 beats/min, and blood pressure of 153/83 mm Hg. Physical examination findings were unremarkable except for multiple scaly plaques distributed primarily on the extensor surfaces of his knees and elbows, consistent with psoriasis. He had no palpable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. The initial complete blood cell count showed a hemoglobin level of 11.9 g/dL (reference range shown parenthetically) (13.5-17.5 g/dL), hematocrit of 33.6% (38.8%50%), mean corpuscular volume of 89.2 fL (81.2-95 fL), leukocyte count of 6.9 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L (3.5-10.5 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L), and platelet count of 266 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L (150-450 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L).

Urinalysis revealed a pH of 6.5 and a trace of proteinuria; microscopic examination showed 1 to 3 red blood cells per high-power field. Findings on chest radiography were normal except for minimal anterior wedging of 1 mid-thoracic vertebral body. The patient was admitted to the hospital for management of hypercalcemia.\n\n【3】*   1\n\n【4】    **_Which one of the following is the most likely cause of hypercalcemia in this patient?_**\n\n【5】    *   a.\n\n【6】        _Primary hyperparathyroidism_\n\n【7】    *   b.\n\n【8】        _Hydrochlorothiazide intake_\n\n【9】    *   c.\n\n【10】        _Hyperthyroidism_\n\n【11】    *   d.\n\n【12】        _Multiple myeloma (MM)_\n\n【13】    *   e.\n\n【14】        _Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)_\n\n【15】The degree of hypercalcemia may be useful diagnostically. Primary hyperparathyroidism is often associated with borderline or mild hypercalcemia, with the serum calcium concentration often being lower than 11 mg/dL.\n\n【16】Anemia is not typically present, although it may occur occasionally due to replacement of the marrow with fibrosis. These features do not fit our patient's clinical situation.\n\n【17】In a patient taking hydrochlorothiazide, thiazide-induced hypercalcemia is usually mild. Thus, thiazide intake per se is rarely the primary cause of a serum calcium level higher than 12 mg/dL. Our patient's calcium level suggests the presence of an underlying disease even if the diagnosis is not suspected before initiation of thiazide.\n\n【18】Fatigue and malaise may be the initial manifestations of an apathetic form of hyperthyroidism that is found especially in elderly patients. Hyperthyroidism can produce mild hypercalcemia, which is found in one fourth of patients with hyperthyroidism. However, blood calcium levels seldom exceed 11 mg/dL.\n\n【19】In addition, renal calculi are distinctly uncommon in a patient with thyrotoxicosis.\n\n【20】Hypercalcemia occurs in about 30% of all patients with MM. Diffuse bone loss and vertebral fractures occur in most patients. The serum creatinine value is elevated in more than one half of patients at diagnosis and is higher than 2.0 mg/dL in approximately one fourth of patients. A normocytic, normochromic anemia is seen in nearly two thirds of patients at the time of diagnosis. The presence of mild anemia, hypercalcemia, acute renal failure, and vertebral fracture in our patient suggests MM.\n\n【21】Hypercalcemia that occurs in patients with FHH is usually mild. Mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid cells and kidneys lead to a defective calcium regulation such that higher than normal calcium levels are necessary to suppress parathyroid hormone (PTH) release. Patients with this rare autosomal dominant disorder are not at increased risk of kidney stones. These anticipated findings are incongruent with findings in our patient.\n\n【22】*   2.\n\n【23】    _Which one of the following is the most important factor in the diagnostic work-up of this patient's suspected condition?_\n\n【24】    *   a.\n\n【25】        _PTH_\n\n【26】    *   b.\n\n【27】        _Alkaline phosphatase_\n\n【28】    *   c.\n\n【29】        _Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)_\n\n【30】    *   d.\n\n【31】        _β2-Microglobulin_\n\n【32】    *   e.\n\n【33】        _1,25-Hydroxyvitamin D_\n\n【34】Although there are numerous causes of hypercalcemia, primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy account for 80% to 90% of the cases,\n\n【35】the former accounting for more than 90% of cases in ambulatory patients. Hence, PTH measurement should always be the first step in the laboratory diagnosis of hypercalcemia. However, this is not the most important test in the diagnostic work-up of MM.\n\n【36】More than 95% of the total serum activity of alkaline phosphatase is derived from liver cells and osteoblasts. The quantification of this enzyme as a biochemical index is nonspecific; it is used primarily for screening and follow- up of liver and metabolic bone disease.\n\n【37】Serum protein electrophoresis is an easy to perform screening procedure for M proteins. When a plasma cell disorder is suspected, SPEP should always be performed in combination with immunofixation. Depending on the method, SPEP has a sensitivity of up to 95% and a specificity of 99% for monoclonal gammopathies. Approximately 2% of patients with MM are null excretors of protein, and MM will be diagnosed only with bone marrow biopsy. Nevertheless, SPEP is the most helpful test in this patient in whom we suspect MM. Urinary protein electrophoresis should likewise be performed since the results from this test complement those from SPEP in establishing the diagnosis of various paraproteinemias.\n\n【38】β <sub>2 </sub> \\-Microglobulin measurement is not helpful because it does not distinguish clearly between monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) and myeloma. Likewise, increased levels of β <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin are found in association with various lymphoproliferative disorders\n\n【39】 however, β <sub>2 </sub> \\-microglobulin measurement is extremely useful for assessing the prognosis of and response to therapy in patients with MM.\n\n【40】In patients with certain lymphoproliferative and granulomatous diseases, calcitriol is produced in extrarenal sites, probably by macrophages or B cells. This results in elevated serum 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. However, this assay is not vital to the diagnosis of MM.\n\n【41】Serum protein electrophoresis and urinary protein electrophoresis with immunofixation showed no apparent monoclonal protein. Further tests were performed to investigate the etiology of this patient's hypercalcemia. The PTH-whole molecule level was 0.7 pmol/L (1.0-5.2 pmol/L), sensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone level was 3.0 mIU/L (0.30-5.0 mIU/L), alkaline phosphatase level was 339 U/L (98-251 U/L), vitamin D level was 86 ng/mL (8-38 ng/mL), and 24-hour urinary calcium level was 497 mg/specimen (25-300 mg/specimen).\n\n【42】*   3.\n\n【43】    _Which one of the following tests is the most appropriate for further investigation of our patient's illness?_\n\n【44】    *   a.\n\n【45】        _Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen_\n\n【46】    *   b.\n\n【47】        _Plasma cell labeling index_\n\n【48】    *   c.\n\n【49】        _Skeletal survey_\n\n【50】    *   d.\n\n【51】        _Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest and abdomen_\n\n【52】    *   e.\n\n【53】        _Positron emission tomography_\n\n【54】The presence of a suppressed level of PTH accompanying this patient's hypercalcemia, together with microscopic hematuria, anemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase level, raises the possibility of a paraneoplastic phenomenon related to renal cell carcinoma, such as Stauffer syndrome.\n\n【55】Performing CT of the abdomen is the most appropriate test at this time.\n\n【56】Plasma cell labeling index is used in distinguishing MGUS from MM. Because both entities are unlikely given the result of the SPEP and urinary protein electrophoresis, this test is inappropriate.\n\n【57】A skeletal survey is useful for searching for osteolytic lesions in patients with either MM or metastatic carcinoma. However, it is nonspecific and should be used for prognostic staging rather than for diagnosis.\n\n【58】Although MRI is preferred over CT in certain settings, such as in delineating soft tissue abnormalities particularly around bony structures that can produce imaging artifacts on CT, MRI is rarely the first-line diagnostic imaging modality of choice because of cost and technical issues.\n\n【59】Positron emission tomography provides input regarding the metabolic activity of certain lesions, hence suggesting the probability of malignancy. It is generally considered only after suspicious lesions have been identified with standard imaging techniques such as CT. Although use of positron emission tomography in staging tumors and detecting occult malignancy is increasing, its role in evaluating disease remains to be adequately defined.\n\n【60】Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis showed bilateral renal stones. In addition, moderate adenopathy in the gastrohepatic ligament and enlarged periceliac and peripancreatic nodes were present. Chest CT showed no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.\n\n【61】*   4.\n\n【62】    _Which one of the following procedures is the best choice to elucidate the cause of this patient's lymphadenopathy?_\n\n【63】    *   a.\n\n【64】        _Exploratory laparotomy_\n\n【65】    *   b.\n\n【66】        _CT-guided biopsy_\n\n【67】    *   c.\n\n【68】        _Bone marrow aspiration_\n\n【69】    *   d.\n\n【70】        _Gallium citrate Ga 67 lung scan_\n\n【71】    *   e.\n\n【72】        _Indium In scan_\n\n【73】To establish the etiology of lymphadenopathies in general, obtaining a tissue specimen for pathologic diagnosis is the “gold standard.” In this patient who has several intra- peritoneal lymph nodes that are causing no morbid or severe symptoms such as obstruction or pain refractory to medical management, exploratory laparotomy is unwarranted. The risks would outweigh any potential benefit. Biopsy with CT guidance is minimally invasive and is relatively safe and effective. Nevertheless, normal or nonspecific results may be obtained due to sampling error, and further diagnostic or therapeutic measures rely on clinical judgment and overall course of the disease.\n\n【74】Bone marrow aspiration is not used for the diagnosis but rather for disease staging of lymphoma because involvement of the marrow is usually focal. Hence, this test is inappropriate in our patient.\n\n【75】Gallium lung scanning is not recommended for evaluating causes of lymphadenopathy. The test result is not only difficult to interpret but also nonspecific and has low sensitivity. However, it is superior to CT in distinguishing mediastinal fibrosis from active tumor tissue after treatment of lymphomas. Indium scanning images the entire body and is generally used for patients in whom the initial evaluation shows no underlying infection or inflammation. Use of these nuclear imaging scans remains investigational to date.\n\n【76】The patient subsequently underwent fine-needle aspiration of a retroperitoneal lymph node. Noncaseating granulomatous inflammation was seen. Special stains for microorganisms and acid-fast bacilli were negative. The serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level was elevated at 81 U/L (7-46 U/L). The purified protein derivative test result was negative.\n\n【77】*   5.\n\n【78】    _At this point, which one of the following diagnoses is most likely in this patient?_\n\n【79】    *   a.\n\n【80】        _Tuberculosis_\n\n【81】    *   b.\n\n【82】        _Sarcoidosis_\n\n【83】    *   c.\n\n【84】        _Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)_\n\n【85】    *   d.\n\n【86】        _Lymphoma_\n\n【87】    *   e.\n\n【88】        _Berylliosis_\n\n【89】Tuberculosis is a mycobacterial infection that has been associated with hypercalcemia and an increased ACE level.\n\n【90】However, caseation is the typical histopathologic finding in this entity, which differs from that seen in our patient.\n\n【91】Although the presence of noncaseating granulomas is not diagnostic by itself, the composite of clinical findings such as high levels of calcitriol, hypercalciuria, hypercalcemia, negative purified protein derivative test results, and increased ACE levels together with the cytologic evidence makes sarcoidosis the most likely diagnosis.\n\n【92】A differential diagnosis to consider in a patient who presents with fatigue and has anemia and abdominal lymphadenopathy is CLL. Most symptomatic patients have enlarged lymph nodes and splenomegaly. Enlargement of the cervical and supraclavicular nodes occurs more commonly than lymphadenopathy elsewhere. Mesenteric or retroperitoneal involvement is infrequent. Moreover, patients with CLL have demonstrable lymphocytosis in routine complete blood cell counts. Lymph node architecture is diffusely effaced by small lymphocytes. These points argue against the diagnosis of CLL in our patient.\n\n【93】Although elevated serum levels of calcitriol are found in many patients with hypercalcemia who have either high- grade widespread B-cell lymphomas or Hodgkin disease, individual characteristic histopathologic findings distinguish such patients from those with sarcoidosis. Moreover, the ACE level is usually low in patients with malignant lymphomas.\n\n【94】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【95】Berylliosis is an antigen-driven pulmonary disease characterized histologically by noncaseating granulomas and mononuclear cell infiltrates and is diagnosed in the presence of beryllium exposure and evidence of beryllium sensitization. However, our patient had findings confined to the peritoneal cavity, incongruous with berylliosis.\n\n【96】After we withheld hydrochlorothiazide and administered aggressive saline diuresis, the patient's hypercalcemia improved, and his serum calcium levels plateaued at 11 to 11.2 mg/dL. Prednisone, 40 mg/d, was then initiated. His serum calcium level normalized within 5 days of institution of prednisone. Corticosteroid use was tapered over 6 months. Repeated CT of the abdomen after treatment showed remarkable regression in the size of the intra- abdominal lymph nodes. Although withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids is a risk factor for exacerbation of psoriasis, this did not occur in our patient.\n\n【97】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【98】First described by Hutchinson in 1877, sarcoidosis has remained an enigma despite progress in accumulating pathologic and clinical data. Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatous disorder whose etiology remains unknown.\n\n【99】The diagnosis is made by histological evidence of non- caseating epithelioid cell granulomas in support of clinico- radiologic findings and by exclusion of other diseases capable of producing a similar histological or clinical picture. The value of monitoring ACE levels for disease activity remains unclear. However, the ACE level should never be used as the sole indication for initiating treatment.\n\n【100】Hypercalcemia is usually transient in patients with subacute sarcoidosis and may fluctuate in those with chronic sarcoidosis, depending on disease activity. Although hypercalcemia has long been recognized as a complication of sarcoidosis, the importance of hypercalciuria has been less appreciated. In patients with sarcoidosis, hypercalciuria is 3 times more common than hypercalcemia.\n\n【101】In some studies, the frequency of hypercalciuria is 60%.\n\n【102】Renal calculi have been found in about 10% of patients with chronic sarcoidosis. Hypercalciuria is slightly more common in men than in women and in white people than in West Indian patients. The mechanism of hypercalciuria appears to be 2-fold: (1) absorptive, associated with elevated serum 1,25- hydroxyvitamin D levels and an abnormally high urinary calcium-creatinine ratio; and (2) resorptive, as evidenced by the association of osteopenia, persistence of hyper- calciuria despite a calcium-poor diet, and association with an osteoclast-activating factor. An osteoclast-activating factor is a bone-reabsorbing substance produced by activated lymphocytes, mononuclear cells, and sarcoid granulomas. These sarcoid granulomas may be responsible for bone resorption.\n\n【103】Corticosteroids have conventionally been the initial treatment of choice, but there is no clear evidence that they modify the course of sarcoidosis despite numerous investigations. However, systemic therapy is clearly indicated in patients with severe organ impairment, such as progressive pulmonary disease. Extrapulmonary involvement of the neurologic, cardiac, and ophthalmologic systems unresponsive to topical agents or in patients with hypercalcemia warrants treatment even when symptoms are minimal because of the deleterious consequences that may ensue. Prednisone, 20 to 40 mg/d, is the drug of choice to reduce the endogenous production of 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D. Institution of corticosteroid therapy causes a decrease in circulating 1,25-hydroxyvitamin D and serum calcium levels within 3 to 5 days. A decrease in the urinary calcium excretion rate occurs within 7 to 10 days.\n\n【104】If the serum calcium level fails to normalize after 2 weeks of corticosteroid therapy, the clinician should exclude the possibility of a coexisting disorder, including hyperparathyroidism, carcinoma, lymphoma, and myeloma. Once the calcium abnormality is controlled, the prednisone dose can be reduced over a period of 4 to 6 weeks. If the patient develops unbearable adverse effects from corticosteroid therapy or treatment fails, chloroquine or hydrochloroquine should be given. The latter 2 drugs are known to reduce serum 1,25- hydroxyvitamin D and calcium concentrations by inhibiting 1a-hydroxylase.\n\n【105】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【106】Correct answers: 1. _d_ , 2. _c_ , 3. _a_ , 4. _b,_ 5\\. _b_", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:32:20", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:33:00", "cost": 39.836}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:33", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:33:00", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:32:19"}

Specifically, the Editorial Board focused on accepting more influential manuscripts on timely topics and expanding the diversity of authorship (eg, related to geography and institutional affiliation). The Editorial Board augmented this shift when planning and preparing the more recent symposium series on “Neoplastic Hematology and Medical Oncology: Diagnosis and Treatment” (2005-2008), “Cardiovascular Diseases: Diagnosis and Management” (2008-2010), and “Antimicrobial Therapy” (2011-2012). Briefly, the Editorial Board used needs assessment techniques to determine the best topics and then recruited authoritative authors from around the world to write corresponding articles. This process will continue in 2012 and beyond with all categories of articles. Once engaged in peer review, the manuscripts must stand on their own, meeting or exceeding the journal's high standards before they will be considered for publication. Through these enhanced methods, the Editorial Board will ratchet up the quality of articles published, ensuring that they are focused primarily on values within the journal's new mission statement.\n\n【4】In interpreting the new mission statement in the context of a readership primarily engaged in the practice of internal medicine (and the major medical subspecialties), the Editorial Board emphasizes that authors from diverse medical specialties and disciplines are welcome to write for the _Proceedings_ , provided the subject matter of their submissions is consonant with the journal's mission. Submitted manuscripts should have broad appeal but need not be restricted only to diseases and therapies addressed by the target audience. Instead, the board also welcomes articles on medical ethics, health care policy, medical economics, medical education, the science of health care delivery, and other topics of interest to the journal audience served. These broader topics are often of value in improving communications with patients and their loved ones.\n\n【5】Although the primary audience of the _Proceedings_ is practicing physicians, the journal also recognizes the importance of providing information that is both accessible and relevant to the work of other health care professionals. As such, the Editorial Board welcomes manuscript submissions that have broad-reaching implications and effectively communicate with readers from diverse backgrounds.\n\n【6】Readers have repeatedly told the journal's leadership that one of their most treasured aspects of the _Proceedings_ is that anyone, regardless of background, can find something interesting in every issue. The board will not lose sight of this value as we move the journal forward. In brief, we desire to provide a meeting place where well-informed authors can share with the world the most interesting and influential biomedical ideas of our time.\n\n【7】Dissemination of Information\n----------------------------\n\n【8】### Print Journal\n\n【9】Readers will note that this January 2012 print issue is comely and strikingly different from its predecessor. The main journal colors, blue and orange, hold special significance. The blue plays homage to the logo color of the journal's sponsor, Mayo Clinic. The orange pays homage to the journal's foundation and heritage, recognizing that from July 1977 through December 2012, the façade color of the monthly print issue was a brilliant orange. Inside the journal, the predominant highlight color is orange, in recognition of the fact that our institutional sponsor encourages—no, demands—that the journal rigorously maintain its editorial independence if it is to contribute optimally to the future of medicine worldwide. It is the Editorial Board's desire that, even though most of the orange coloration has moved from the cover to the inside of the journal, readers will still think of us as “the orange journal.”\n\n【10】The print journal changes are not merely cosmetic but also functional. New features include more white space, more readable fonts, and color on every page. Each category of article will have functional style elements unique to that category. These style changes will help better organize journal content and present information hierarchically so that readers' access and comprehension are enhanced. Moving to a fully integrated, 4-color production process will facilitate authors' use of color images to enhance communications. Graphs, other figures, and tables will also be published with color enhancement. Taken together, the publisher's and Editorial Board's intent is to use better elements of style to enhance readers' learning experiences and enjoyment.\n\n【11】### Electronic Communications\n\n【12】Visitors to the _Proceedings_ ' Web site in January 2012 and beyond will notice a complete redesign and a continuum of future updates and improvements. The new site is designed to reproduce or complement many elements of the print journal but also to have tools to accommodate continuing medical education credit, access content that is supplemental to the print journal articles, and disseminate additional content (extra Residents' Clinics articles, Medical Images, Stamp Vignettes, and other materials) not available in the print journal. Furthermore, the Web site will contain an increasing amount of interactive features to enhance readers' educational opportunities and enjoyment. Within the next year, readers will be able to obtain a _Proceedings_ ' mobile application through the Web site and have better access to electronic classified advertisements (eg, for job postings) and an electronic bookstore. In addition, the archive of past articles will be progressively enlarged in ensuing years.\n\n【13】Representatives of the Editorial Board's Executive Committee will oversee the ongoing upgrades of the Web site, and their expectations are to introduce improvements to the Web site on an ongoing basis, in perpetuity. The ultimate goal is to provide visitors with quicker access and a richer viewing experience. Given this embrace of change, the Editorial Board welcomes your comments regarding elements you would like to have included on the site. To enhance this critique, all Web site content will be free and open to the public from January 3 through February 28, 2012, at which time access restrictions to nonsubscribers will be reintroduced.\n\n【14】### Media Coverage\n\n【15】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【16】and 1 article that introduced new methods for studying rare diseases\n\n【17】collectively reached an audience that numbered in the hundreds of millions.\n\n【18】Media coverage of articles is important to the mission of the journal because it allows the journal to reach populations of interested individuals who would probably not have access through more traditional methods, and media coverage helps draw health care professionals back to the core journal articles. Clearly, recent successes with expanded media coverage should lead to greater dissemination of important information in clinical medicine, with immediate benefit to authors, patients, and health care professionals.\n\n【19】Metrics\n-------\n\n【20】### Manuscript Selection\n\n【21】Elite medical journals must rely on their ability to select from a large number of submitted manuscripts those that are of the highest quality and of most relevance to the target audience. In this regard, the _Proceedings_ experienced immense progress during its evolution era, with manuscript submissions increasing by approximately 3-fold and the acceptance rate decreasing to the same degree. Within the new era initiative, the Editorial Board will encourage (through direct recruitment and broader-reaching promotional programs) an increasing number of authors from diverse backgrounds to share their manuscripts with the journal and select for publication those manuscripts that best conform to the journal's mission statement values. The immediate beneficiaries will be readers, but authors whose manuscripts are accepted will also benefit from publishing their work in a top-tier journal having a worldwide content distribution network. Improved, streamlined manuscript processing will also take into account the needs of authors whose works are not accepted for publication. For manuscripts triaged from peer review, we will provide rapid feedback to authors. In addition, for authors whose manuscripts are rejected through formal peer review, we will do our best to provide thoughtful comments that will assist them in improving their work and securing publication elsewhere.\n\n【22】### Speed of Processing and Publication\n\n【23】During the evolution initiative, the _Proceedings_ was able to reduce to approximately 3 weeks the average time from manuscript submission to first response to authors and to 10 to 12 weeks the time from manuscript acceptance to publication. During the new era campaign, the Editorial Board hopes to reduce these intervals even further.\n\n【24】Refinement of existing processes will further lessen the time to first response to authors; however, a completely new publishing paradigm will be used to significantly reduce acceptance-to-publication times. Specifically, the journal has historically used the article published in print as the publication of record, although in recent years we have migrated to using the electronic article publication as the publication of record. At the end of 2011, most articles were published simultaneously in electronic and print versions on the first day of the month. Only a few articles were electronically published ahead of print. In 2012, we will change the focus of article release from a once-monthly schedule, which relies on multiple articles collated in the print journal, and move to a continuous-feed model, which focuses on individual articles released electronically shortly after acceptance for publication. (Those articles will later be published in a print issue.) Only a few articles will be held back from near-immediate electronic release, and those instances will be to facilitate the collation of multiple articles on a given subject, often introduced by an editorial.\n\n【25】For accepted manuscripts, authors frequently ask, “What is the _Proceedings_ ' typical time from manuscript receipt to publication?” Few realize that this is an almost meaningless metric of journal performance, in large measure because the process is heavily author dependent. Specifically, important manuscripts that are clearly written and have generalizable results that are of interest to a large audience tend to move through peer review much faster. In contrast, for less competitive manuscripts on arcane topics, it is difficult to obtain reviewers and have those reviewers submit their critiques quickly. Overall processing times must also factor in the quickness and thoroughness with which authors respond to reviews. Hence, in 2012 and beyond, just as was the case before, even though the journal will reduce processing and publication times meaningfully, individual authors may have outlying experiences, sometimes based on the characteristics of the manuscripts they submit to the journal.\n\n【26】The Editorial Board has always been receptive to authors who request expedited review and expedited publication of individual manuscripts, and this attitude will continue. After considerable deliberation, the board determined that it will not introduce a separate expedited review and publication program during the new era initiative, simply because our plan is to expedite the processing and publication of _all_ manuscripts.\n\n【27】### Impact Factor and Readership\n\n【28】Two of the most widely discussed journal metrics are impact factor and readership. Impact factor provides an assessment of the scientific quality and sphere of influence of journal articles and is based on downstream article citations within a 2-year window after the year of publication. It is quantified by Thompson Reuters (New York, NY). Readership is an assessment of how often readers access and read journal content and is intimately tied to the timeliness, importance, and relevance to the audience of article content. Recent _Proceedings_ articles on antimicrobial stewardship\n\n【29】and the common misrepresentation of a measles-mumps-rubella vaccine link with autism\n\n【30】are examples of articles that lived up to the Editorial Board's expectations of immense readership. Journal readership is primarily quantified through surveys conducted by Kantor Media (Princeton, NJ), supplemented with calculations of Internet access and related techniques.\n\n【31】Despite a variety of forces interfering with a journal from moving all metrics forward at once, the _Proceedings_ has succeeded in amassing exemplary records of improvement in recent years. This is seen most vividly in the journal's impact factor data.\n\n【32】From the first reporting of impact factor data in 1977 until the beginning of the _Proceedings_ ' evolution campaign, the journal had an impact factor of approximately 2. However, during the evolution period, the _Proceedings_ impact factor increased for 11 consecutive years, from 2.0 to 5.71 . Impact factor ranking increased from approximately the best 20% of all general internal medicine journals to the best 8.5%. Specifically, with the reporting of the most recent impact factor, the _Proceedings_ was the 13th highest of 153 general internal medicine journals. Furthermore, among the world's top 15 journals of this genre, the _Proceedings_ is the only one to experience an increase in each of these 11 years. Clearly, this record of multiyear progress—resulting from the publication of more important articles of greater relevance to our readers—suggests that progress should continue for the long term.\n\n【33】Financial Matters\n-----------------\n\n【34】### Circulation\n\n【35】During the new era campaign, the _Proceedings_ will retain its controlled-circulation model of publication. Specifically, physicians in the target demographic will receive the print journal, the electronic journal, or both free of charge, but those outside this demographic, along with institutional subscribers, must pay a fee for their subscriptions. The target audience will consist of physicians who are engaged in the practice of general internal medicine and are registered through either doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy mechanisms. In addition, physicians practicing in select, targeted internal medicine subspecialties, Mayo Clinic faculty physicians, Mayo Clinic residents and fellows, and Mayo Clinic alumni will receive the journal free of charge, although there may be restrictions on whether the subscription is electronic only or electronic plus print. The Editorial Board's and publisher's intermediate-term goal is to maintain print circulation at approximately 125,000 copies per issue, thus retaining the journal's ranking among the world's largest print circulation journals.\n\n【36】In 2009, the Editorial Board acknowledged a challenging time in journal finances due to downturns in the print journal market, and we asked physicians to participate in a voluntary paid subscription (VPS) program.\n\n【37】Many of our readers participated, and the moneys obtained from this program helped the journal maintain and advance its mission. With the new era initiative, we will close the VPS program. In doing so, I deeply thank those readers who contributed to the VPS program. Your gestures of appreciation and support for the journal were as important as the money you contributed in seeing us through a difficult time.\n\n【38】### Authors' Fees\n\n【39】For most of its 85-year life, the _Proceedings_ has invoked fees on authors to help offset the costs of manuscript processing, color printing, and related services. These fees will end for all authors, effective immediately, as a result of the journal restructuring its entire business model. There will be only one exception anticipated: authors who wish to have their manuscripts released immediately for Web access to all parties, not just formal subscribers, will be required to pay a fee for this service.\n\n【40】Of note, the _Proceedings_ plans to have much more color artwork within its pages during the new era period. Again, the provision of color will happen at no cost to authors.\n\n【41】Hiccups\n-------\n\n【42】It should be apparent that the closure of the _Proceedings_ ' evolution campaign and the initiation of the new era campaign have required an immense amount of work, culminating in a plateau of effort beginning in mid-2011 with the announcement of publishing representation by Elsevier publishers and continuing for the foreseeable future. This activity has required the contributions of many talented individuals, including publishers, office staff, Editorial Board members, attorneys, experts in media relations, accountants, brand managers, artists, business managers, and members of creative think tanks. Many of these are new contributors to the _Proceedings_ or have contributed to a greater extent than in the past. Among the many contributors are the members of the staff and Editorial Board who throughout have been responsible for overseeing peer review and processing manuscripts for publication. Not surprisingly, enhanced activities in some areas have potentially altered contributions elsewhere. Although we would prefer otherwise, these competitions with individuals' traditional activities have the potential to produce short-term hiccups in some metrics (mentioned earlier) of importance to the journal.\n\n【43】Some of these hiccups seem almost inevitable. For example, quantification of readership by Kantar Media involves survey forms that rely on readers' recognition of the journal cover. With the major remodeling of our cover, it is possible that some readers may not recognize the connection between the new and old _Proceedings_ and may fail to accurately account for their readership involvement. Elsewhere, when changing from an older to a newer form of controlled circulation accounting, we have discovered subscription errors of omission and duplication. In remediating these problems, we will almost certainly introduce new short-term errors in codifying our target audience readers.\n\n【44】Our goal is that, if and when these hiccups occur, we will remediate any problems as soon as possible. We ask your support and patience during the period of transition.\n\n【45】Closing\n-------\n\n【46】The Editorial Board, Elsevier, and I thank you for your ongoing loyalty to the _Proceedings_ , and we encourage you to share with us any insights you have for improving the quality of the journal and our operations. We collectively have immense aspirations for the journal's future and the quality of its relationship with readers.

In 2012, we will change the focus of article release from a once-monthly schedule, which relies on multiple articles collated in the print journal, and move to a continuous-feed model, which focuses on individual articles released electronically shortly after acceptance for publication. (Those articles will later be published in a print issue.) Only a few articles will be held back from near-immediate electronic release, and those instances will be to facilitate the collation of multiple articles on a given subject, often introduced by an editorial.\n\n【25】For accepted manuscripts, authors frequently ask, “What is the _Proceedings_ ' typical time from manuscript receipt to publication?” Few realize that this is an almost meaningless metric of journal performance, in large measure because the process is heavily author dependent. Specifically, important manuscripts that are clearly written and have generalizable results that are of interest to a large audience tend to move through peer review much faster. In contrast, for less competitive manuscripts on arcane topics, it is difficult to obtain reviewers and have those reviewers submit their critiques quickly. Overall processing times must also factor in the quickness and thoroughness with which authors respond to reviews. Hence, in 2012 and beyond, just as was the case before, even though the journal will reduce processing and publication times meaningfully, individual authors may have outlying experiences, sometimes based on the characteristics of the manuscripts they submit to the journal.\n\n【26】The Editorial Board has always been receptive to authors who request expedited review and expedited publication of individual manuscripts, and this attitude will continue. After considerable deliberation, the board determined that it will not introduce a separate expedited review and publication program during the new era initiative, simply because our plan is to expedite the processing and publication of _all_ manuscripts.\n\n【27】### Impact Factor and Readership\n\n【28】Two of the most widely discussed journal metrics are impact factor and readership. Impact factor provides an assessment of the scientific quality and sphere of influence of journal articles and is based on downstream article citations within a 2-year window after the year of publication. It is quantified by Thompson Reuters (New York, NY). Readership is an assessment of how often readers access and read journal content and is intimately tied to the timeliness, importance, and relevance to the audience of article content. Recent _Proceedings_ articles on antimicrobial stewardship\n\n【29】and the common misrepresentation of a measles-mumps-rubella vaccine link with autism\n\n【30】are examples of articles that lived up to the Editorial Board's expectations of immense readership. Journal readership is primarily quantified through surveys conducted by Kantor Media (Princeton, NJ), supplemented with calculations of Internet access and related techniques.\n\n【31】Despite a variety of forces interfering with a journal from moving all metrics forward at once, the _Proceedings_ has succeeded in amassing exemplary records of improvement in recent years. This is seen most vividly in the journal's impact factor data.\n\n【32】From the first reporting of impact factor data in 1977 until the beginning of the _Proceedings_ ' evolution campaign, the journal had an impact factor of approximately 2. However, during the evolution period, the _Proceedings_ impact factor increased for 11 consecutive years, from 2.0 to 5.71 . Impact factor ranking increased from approximately the best 20% of all general internal medicine journals to the best 8.5%. Specifically, with the reporting of the most recent impact factor, the _Proceedings_ was the 13th highest of 153 general internal medicine journals. Furthermore, among the world's top 15 journals of this genre, the _Proceedings_ is the only one to experience an increase in each of these 11 years. Clearly, this record of multiyear progress—resulting from the publication of more important articles of greater relevance to our readers—suggests that progress should continue for the long term.\n\n【33】Financial Matters\n-----------------\n\n【34】### Circulation\n\n【35】During the new era campaign, the _Proceedings_ will retain its controlled-circulation model of publication. Specifically, physicians in the target demographic will receive the print journal, the electronic journal, or both free of charge, but those outside this demographic, along with institutional subscribers, must pay a fee for their subscriptions. The target audience will consist of physicians who are engaged in the practice of general internal medicine and are registered through either doctor of medicine or doctor of osteopathy mechanisms. In addition, physicians practicing in select, targeted internal medicine subspecialties, Mayo Clinic faculty physicians, Mayo Clinic residents and fellows, and Mayo Clinic alumni will receive the journal free of charge, although there may be restrictions on whether the subscription is electronic only or electronic plus print. The Editorial Board's and publisher's intermediate-term goal is to maintain print circulation at approximately 125,000 copies per issue, thus retaining the journal's ranking among the world's largest print circulation journals.\n\n【36】In 2009, the Editorial Board acknowledged a challenging time in journal finances due to downturns in the print journal market, and we asked physicians to participate in a voluntary paid subscription (VPS) program.\n\n【37】Many of our readers participated, and the moneys obtained from this program helped the journal maintain and advance its mission. With the new era initiative, we will close the VPS program. In doing so, I deeply thank those readers who contributed to the VPS program. Your gestures of appreciation and support for the journal were as important as the money you contributed in seeing us through a difficult time.\n\n【38】### Authors' Fees\n\n【39】For most of its 85-year life, the _Proceedings_ has invoked fees on authors to help offset the costs of manuscript processing, color printing, and related services. These fees will end for all authors, effective immediately, as a result of the journal restructuring its entire business model. There will be only one exception anticipated: authors who wish to have their manuscripts released immediately for Web access to all parties, not just formal subscribers, will be required to pay a fee for this service.\n\n【40】Of note, the _Proceedings_ plans to have much more color artwork within its pages during the new era period. Again, the provision of color will happen at no cost to authors.\n\n【41】Hiccups\n-------\n\n【42】It should be apparent that the closure of the _Proceedings_ ' evolution campaign and the initiation of the new era campaign have required an immense amount of work, culminating in a plateau of effort beginning in mid-2011 with the announcement of publishing representation by Elsevier publishers and continuing for the foreseeable future. This activity has required the contributions of many talented individuals, including publishers, office staff, Editorial Board members, attorneys, experts in media relations, accountants, brand managers, artists, business managers, and members of creative think tanks. Many of these are new contributors to the _Proceedings_ or have contributed to a greater extent than in the past. Among the many contributors are the members of the staff and Editorial Board who throughout have been responsible for overseeing peer review and processing manuscripts for publication. Not surprisingly, enhanced activities in some areas have potentially altered contributions elsewhere. Although we would prefer otherwise, these competitions with individuals' traditional activities have the potential to produce short-term hiccups in some metrics (mentioned earlier) of importance to the journal.\n\n【43】Some of these hiccups seem almost inevitable. For example, quantification of readership by Kantar Media involves survey forms that rely on readers' recognition of the journal cover. With the major remodeling of our cover, it is possible that some readers may not recognize the connection between the new and old _Proceedings_ and may fail to accurately account for their readership involvement. Elsewhere, when changing from an older to a newer form of controlled circulation accounting, we have discovered subscription errors of omission and duplication. In remediating these problems, we will almost certainly introduce new short-term errors in codifying our target audience readers.\n\n【44】Our goal is that, if and when these hiccups occur, we will remediate any problems as soon as possible. We ask your support and patience during the period of transition.\n\n【45】Closing\n-------\n\n【46】The Editorial Board, Elsevier, and I thank you for your ongoing loyalty to the _Proceedings_ , and we encourage you to share with us any insights you have for improving the quality of the journal and our operations. We collectively have immense aspirations for the journal's future and the quality of its relationship with readers.

Preoperatively, the BAV exhibited mild or moderate stenosis in 5 patients (mean gradient, 25 mm Hg; range, 19-34 mm Hg), moderate AR in 2, and severe AR in 3. Aortic valve repair was performed in 11 patients. Seventeen patients had excision and graft replacement of the enlarged AA, and 4 patients had primary AA repair. There were no perioperative deaths.

It has multiple adverse effects including neurotoxicity. We describe 2 patients with prior amputation who experienced phantom limb pain (PLP) after receiving paclitaxel therapy. A third patient experienced disabling neurotoxicity in the extremity of a prior ulnar nerve and tendon transposition after receiving paclitaxel. This unique syndrome should be identified as a direct causal effect of paclitaxel. In this report, we review the pathophysiology of PLP and treatment options. Physicians should be aware that PLP can occur after initiation of paclitaxel.\n\n【1】PLP ( phantom limb pain )\n\n【2】Paclitaxel, a natural product obtained from _Taxus brevifolia_ , has antitumor activity by promoting the assembly of microtubules from tubulin dimers and stabilizing them by preventing depolarization. This results in the inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubule network that is essential for vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.\n\n【3】Taxol produces a predomi-nantly sensory neuropathy.\n\n【4】Paclitaxel has activity against several malignancies, including breast, ovarian, lung, and bladder lymphomas as well as head and neck cancers.\n\n【5】In this report, we describe 2 patients with prior amputation who experienced severe phantom limb pain (PLP) associated with paclitaxel chemotherapy. An additional patient with a prior tendon and nerve transposition experienced severe disabling pain and weakness in his hand after 1 cycle of paclitaxel.\n\n【6】Report Of Cases\n---------------\n\n【7】### Case 1\n\n【8】A 65-year-old woman with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism underwent amputation below the right knee in 1992 because of peripheral vascular disease. She experienced PLP for a few weeks after the amputation. In 1995, she was diagnosed with stage lIB (T2 Nl M0) infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the left breast. She underwent a modified radical mastectomy and was subsequently randomized to Southwest Oncology Group protocol 9410. She was to receive 4 cycles of doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cyclophosphamide every 21 days, followed by 4 cycles of paclitaxel. She tolerated therapy well until completion of the second cycle of paclitaxel when she complained of severe, intermittent, and disabling PLP in her right leg. Oxycodone was necessary for symptomatic relief. The patient agreed to complete the 4 cycles of paclitaxel in conjunction with narcotics. After she had completed the chemotherapy, the PLP resolved 6 weeks later.\n\n【9】### Case 2\n\n【10】A 37-year-old woman underwent surgery in 1970 because of osteogenic sarcoma in her right proximal femur. Amputation above the right knee resulted in successful resection of the localized disease. Prophylactic radiation therapy of 18 Gy was then delivered to her lungs to prevent metastasis. The patient noted PLP at that time, which resolved over 3 months. In 1984, she developed stage I (T1 N0 M0) infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the right breast, which resulted in a right modified radical mastectomy. Two years later, a metachronous stage II (T1 N0 M0) carcinoma of the left breast was detected. Modified radical mastectomy, followed by silicone breast implants, was performed. She then received 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (Adriarnycin), and fluorouracil adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n【11】In 1987, the patient had disease metastatic to the lungs. Tamoxifen therapy resulted in a protracted partial response for 6 years. The pulmonary nodules progressed in 1993, and treatment with megestrol acetate failed. Therapy with doxorubicin, 60 mg/m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> , and paclitaxel, 200 mg/m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> , every 3 weeks was initiated. The disease stabilized. By the sixth cycle of therapy, the patient described the sensation of PLP at the site of the right above-knee amputation 23 years earlier. The pain was burning, intense, and sharp. She declined further therapy with paclitaxel and required propoxyphene napsylate and acetaminophen for pain relief. The PLP resolved 8 weeks later.\n\n【12】### Case 3\n\n【13】A 74-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, smoking, and excision of a fibrosarcoma, which required tendon and nerve transposition, 30 years earlier presented with stage IIIA (T3 N1 M0) squamous cell carcinoma of the right lung. He was treated with brachytherapy, followed by 2 cycles of concurrent radiation therapy combined with etoposide and cisplatin. After a partial response was achieved, consolidation therapy consisting of paclitaxel, 200 mg/m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> , and carboplatin, 230 mg/m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> , was initiated. After 1 cycle, he experienced debilitating pain in his right hand at the site of the tendon and nerve transposition. The hand weakened, and lancinating pain was noted in the medial digits of the right hand. The patient was unable to use his right hand and lost all function with this hand. Chemotherapy was discontinued, and he underwent physical therapy to strengthen motor function; after 3 months, improvement was noted. By 9 months, his right hand had returned to baseline function.\n\n【14】Discussion\n----------\n\n【15】Taxanes, such as paclitaxel, have increasing indications for use in patients with cancer. Limb amputations in patients with cancer, especially in pediatric patients, are decreasing because of limb preservation surgical techniques and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, amputation remains common in patients with peripheral vascular disease and traumatized limbs. Paclitaxel has been accepted as first-line therapy for patients with lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and bladder cancer.\n\n【16】To our knowledge, paclitaxel-associated PLP has not been reported previously. A MEDLINE search from 1990 to 1999 and of Bristol-Myers Squibb Oncology records revealed no reports of this phenomenon.\n\n【17】Other severe events that have been reported after administration of paclitaxel include myelosuppression, mainly in the form of neutropenia (90%); hypersensitivity (31%-36%)\n\n【18】 mucositis (17%-23%); neurologic complications (46%-70%); and even sudden death.\n\n【19】The frequency and severity of the neurologic manifestations are dose dependent, occurring with cumulative dosing and higher doses per cycle, but they are not dependent on the rate of infusion.\n\n【20】Peripheral neurotoxicity of taxol in patients previously treated with cisplattn.\n\n【21】In all patients receiving paclitaxel therapy, peripheral neuropathy occurs in 60% and in 52% of those without preexisting neuropathy. The incidence of neurologic symptoms does not increase in patients previously treated with cisplatin. In 1 study, neurologic symptoms were observed after the first course of paclitaxel in 27% of patients and in 34% to 51% % of those who had received 2 to 10 courses.\n\n【22】These symptoms were due to severe nerve fiber loss, axonal atrophy, and secondary demyelination caused by paclitaxel.\n\n【23】Sensory symptoms usually diminish or resolve within several months after discontinuation of paclitaxel.\n\n【24】Phantom limb pain is defined as the phenomenon of a painful sensation perceived in the missing body part or in the part paralyzed by the spinal cord injury or nerve root avulsion\n\n【25】or, more simply stated, pain that is experienced in a limb that is no longer present.\n\n【26】Effects of regional anesthesia on phantom limb pain are mirrored in changes in cortical reorganization.\n\n【27】The sensation and intensity of PLP were first described in the 16th century.\n\n【28】Phantom limb pain is most commonly found in the distal portions of the richly innervated distal extremities. The onset of PLP is generally within the first few weeks but may occur several months or even years after amputation.\n\n【29】The frequency, duration, and severity of pain episodes decrease during the first 6 months after amputation. A period of quiescence may be interrupted years later by reemergence of PLP. Nathan\n\n【30】reported that an application of a noxious stimulant to the residual of a limb amputated years earlier because of a skating injury resulted in recurrence of PLP.\n\n【31】Two types of PLP are commonly described: an intense burning sensation or painful cramping. Either may be continuous or paroxysmal.\n\n【32】Phantom limb pain is common and unpredictable, varies in frequency, severity, duration, and character, and stabilizes after a period of up to 6 months; response to aggravation by external or internal stimuli is unpredictable.\n\n【33】删除21:<u>There are numerous theories about the cause and pathophysiology of PLP. The neuromatrix concept proposed by Melzack in 1989</u>\n\n【34】删除21:<u>and in 1990</u>\n\n【35】describes the neural circuit of a circuitous route from the brain to the extremities and back to the brain. The neuromatrix describes how normal sensation can be felt in the absence of a body part. The injury site is associated with a proliferation of α-adrenergic channels, calcium channels, and stretch-activated channels with nerve severance or nerve blockage. The change in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord that receives central terminus of afferent fibers is described as plasticity. Plasticity is associated with biochemical changes and neuron development within the dorsal hom, which results in activation of excitability amino acid receptors in the dorsal horn ( _N_ \\-methyl-D-aspartate receptors). Substance P release depolarizes pain-specific neurons and sensitizes neurons to excitability amino acid.\n\n【36】Repetitive firing of peripheral nociceptive fibers may result in hyperexcitability of the dorsal and ventral horns, which results in irritable foci over the posterior column. Excitability amino acids and neurokinins are released and induce neural damage. Repeated depolarization leads to chronic changes in the horn. This cascade and irritable focus can account for pain at the spinal level. Drugs targeted at various initiators have a beneficial role in the prevention or treatment of PLP.\n\n【37】Krane and Heller\n\n【38】described 45 patients who underwent amputations because of congenital deformities, trauma, infection, and cancer. All their patients experienced PLP. In a significant minority of patients undergoing amputation due to malignancy,\n\n【39】PLP can be severe, disabling, and longstanding. Smith and Thompson\n\n【40】noted a higher frequency of PLP in pediatric patients with cancer than in other patients who had undergone amputation. Phantom limb pain was reported in 48% of patients with cancer-related amputations compared with 12% of patients with trauma-associated amputations. Among patients with cancer, PLP was reported by 74% who had undergone chemotherapy before or at the time of amputation, 44% who received chemotherapy after amputation, and 12% who never received chemotherapy. Smith and Thompson also noted that pediatric cancer patients who had undergone amputation often experienced PLP during the first or second day of chemotherapy. To our knowledge, studies of adult amputee patients with cancer who received chemotherapy have not described development of PLP.\n\n【41】Treatment of PLP can best be directed toward actions on the spinal level. The earliest report of treatment of PLP involved the ineffective clubbing and pounding of the residual limb with a wooden mallet. Surgical and neurosurgical approaches including sympathectomy, cordotomy, thalotomy, and gyrectomy all are generally ineffective. _N_ \\-methyl-D-aspartate inhibitors (ketamine), neuron inhibitors (clonidine), sodium channel blockade (mexiletine), inhibitors of substance P production (capsaicin) or release (narcotics), or local anesthetics have all been reported to be effective treatment interventions in PLP. Short-term calcitonin treatment has demonstrated good to excellent longterm results. The mechanism of analgesia with calcitonin remains uncertain, although it is thought to act by stimulation of serotogenic neurons, which reduces local production of prostaglandins and cytokines.\n\n【42】Paclitaxel-associated PLP was completely reversible in our 3 patients. Patients who experience this neurotoxicity should be reassured. Treatment with calcitonin, tricyclics, neuron inhibitors, and narcotics, along with prompt discontinuation of paclitaxel, is an appropriate course of action in patients with PLP.\n\n【43】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【44】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【45】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【46】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【47】Continuous blockade of both brachial plexus with ropivacaine in phantom pain: a case report.\n\n【48】Patients with prior amputation who receive paclitaxel will probably experience PLP.\n\n【49】Although speculative, administration of amifostine in patients receiving initial and subsequent cycles of paclitaxel chemotherapy may prevent or decrease the incidence of PLP in the amputee patient population at risk.\n\n【50】Other rare, serious neurologic events that have occurred after paclitaxel administration include grand mal seizures, syncope, ataxia, neuroencephalopathy, and paralytic ileus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:24:51", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:25:25", "cost": 33.679}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:33", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:25:25", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:24:51"}

The final diagnosis for the cause of dizziness was independently assigned by 2 neurologists, with a third neurologist resolving any disagreements. The primary outcome was a composite of ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, seizure, brain tumor, demyelinating disease, and CNS infection.

Clinical suspicion should be heightened for patients with advanced age, imbalance, or focal deficits.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CT ( computed tomography ), ED ( emergency department ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ), TIA ( transient ischemic attack )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:48:16", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:58:00", "cost": 583.996}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:33", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:58:00", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:48:15"}

Clinical Pearls is designed with the 3 qualities of physician-learners in mind. First, we physicians enjoy learning from cases. Second, we like concise, practical points that we can use in our practice. Finally, we take pleasure in problem solving.\n\n【1】In the Clinical Pearls format, speakers present a number of short cases in their specialty to a general internal medicine audience. Each case is followed by a multiple-choice question answered live by attendees using an audience response system. The answer distribution is shown to attendees. The correct answer is then displayed and the speaker discusses teaching points, clarifying why one answer is most appropriate. Each case presentation ends with a _Clinical Pearl_ , defined as a practical teaching point that is supported by the literature but generally not well known to most internists.\n\n【2】CASE 1\n------\n\n【3】A 75-year-old woman presents with a hip fracture. Her medical history is remarkable for coronary artery disease. Two months previously she had a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and had a drug-eluting stent (DES) placed.

Because of the need for uninterrupted dual antiplatelet therapy after these stents are deployed, elective procedures with a bleeding risk should be deferred. It is recommended that dual antiplatelet therapy be continued without interruption for 4 to 6 weeks after the placement of a bare metal stent (BMS) and for 12 months after a DES to minimize the risk of stent thrombosis.\n\n【25】Prevention of premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery stents.\n\n【26】However, unplanned urgent surgeries may still be necessary during this critical re-endothelialization period. The generally accepted policy is to withdraw antiplatelet agents 7 to 10 days before a surgical or endoscopic procedure because of the fear of excessive bleeding. Premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy markedly increases the risk of stent thrombosis, a catastrophic event that frequently leads to myocardial infarction and/or death. Premature withdrawal of antiplatelet therapy is associated with a 5- to 10-fold increase in the perioperative cardiac death rate, with an average incidence of death of about 30%.\n\n【27】Prevention of premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery stents.\n\n【28】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【29】The case fatality rate for patients who develop stent thrombosis is 45%.\n\n【30】This obviously puts the physicians, surgeons, and patients in a difficult situation. In this case, it is best to consider the risks and benefits of continuation vs discontinuation of the antiplatelet therapy.\n\n【31】What is the risk of surgical bleeding with antiplatelet agents? Aspirin increases the rate of bleeding complications by 1.5 fold; however, for most surgical procedures, it does not increase the severity of or mortality due to bleeding complications.\n\n【32】The exception would be for intracranial neurosurgical and transurethral prostate procedures. Aspirin in addition to clopidogrel is associated with a 30% to 50% increase in relative risk (absolute risk, 0.4%-1%) of major bleeding perioperatively compared with aspirin alone. Dual antiplatelet therapy does not result in increased operative mortality (except for intracranial neurosurgery) but is associated with a slight increase in the need for reoperation and a 30% increase in the need for transfusion.\n\n【33】Therefore, most operations—with the exception of intracranial neurosurgery—can be performed while the patient is receiving dual antiplatelet therapy without significantly increasing morbidity and mortality. Other operations in which bleeding into a closed space could result in serious complications (ie, spinal cord surgery or posterior chamber eye surgery) should also be considered exceptions.\n\n【34】Another option that is often considered is to stop only the clopidogrel but continue the aspirin therapy. This option may be the most appropriate for patients who have stents and are beyond the critical period of stent endothelialization (6 weeks for BMS, 12 months for DES). However, stopping clopidogrel during the critical period places the patient at increased risk of stent thrombosis, even if aspirin is continued. Aspirin alone is not sufficient to prevent stent thrombosis in patients who are not beyond the critical period of stent endothelialization.\n\n【35】Although some physicians may advocate the use of bridging therapy with glycoprotein 2b/3a inhibiting agents or heparin for the period when the patient is not receiving antiplatelet agents, no data support this practice, nor is there evidence that it actually decreases the risk of stent thrombosis or death.\n\n【36】Given the risks and benefits for this patient, the best option would be to proceed with the surgical procedure without interruption of the antiplatelet agents. The American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines also address this issue in the section on the perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy.\n\n【37】The perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th edition).\n\n【38】These guidelines recommend that patients with a DES who require surgery within 12 months of stent placement continue aspirin and clopidogrel therapy in the perioperative period. Additionally, patients with a BMS who require surgery within 6 weeks of stent placement should also continue aspirin and clopidogrel therapy in the perioperative period.\n\n【39】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【40】Most operations (except neurosurgery) can be performed in patients who have recent coronary artery stents and who are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy without increasing mortality.\n\n【41】CASE 2\n------\n\n【42】A 62-year-old man presents for an evaluation before an open cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis under general anesthesia. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea and is actively smoking. He has no history of coronary artery disease. His functional capacity is about 4 to 5 metabolic equivalents. His inhalers include ipratropium, salmeterol, and albuterol, as needed. He uses continuous positive airway pressure at night. Pulmonary function testing 1 year previously revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 60% of predicted.\n\n【43】### Findings on Examination\n\n【44】Oxygen saturation, 91% while breathing room air\n\n【45】Lungs: prolonged expiration phase, otherwise clear\n\n【46】Unremarkable findings on remainder of examination\n\n【47】### Question\n\n【48】Which _one_ of the following strategies will _most effectively_ reduce this patient's risk of postoperative pulmonary complications?\n\n【49】*   a.\n\n【50】    Smoking cessation\n\n【51】*   b.\n\n【52】    Postoperative incentive spirometry\n\n【53】*   c.\n\n【54】    Switching to a laparoscopic surgical technique\n\n【55】*   d.\n\n【56】    Postoperative nasogastric decompression\n\n【57】*   e.\n\n【58】    Preoperative oral corticosteroid therapy\n\n【59】### Discussion\n\n【60】This patient has multiple risk factors that increase his risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, including COPD, current smoking, age, upper abdominal surgical procedure, general anesthesia, and obstructive sleep apnea. To help decrease his risk of pulmonary complications in the postoperative period, several strategies can be considered, including lung-specific strategies, operative technique, anesthesia technique, and postoperative strategies.\n\n【61】In 2006, Lawrence et al\n\n【62】published a systematic review of strategies to reduce pulmonary complications after noncardiothoracic surgery for the American College of Physicians. In this review, the authors reported the strength of the evidence for specific interventions to reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. The best evidence exists for lung-expansion therapy (eg, incentive spirometry, deep breathing exercises, and continuous positive airway pressure) for reducing pulmonary risk after abdominal surgery. However, the comparative effectiveness of different lung-expansion modalities has not been well studied. Strategies of probable benefit are selective nasogastric tube decompression after abdominal surgery and the use of short-acting neuromuscular blocking agents during anesthesia. Strategies of possible benefit include a laparoscopic rather than an open surgical approach for abdominal surgeries; however, the evidence is insufficient to determine whether laparoscopic procedures prevent clinically important pulmonary complications. Strategies of unclear benefit include preoperative smoking cessation. The authors reported no benefit with the routine use of parenteral or enteral hyperalimentation or with the use of invasive perioperative monitoring with pulmonary artery catheterization.\n\n【63】Preoperative use of oral corticosteroids is probably effective in decreasing postoperative pulmonary complications in patients with COPD who have uncontrolled symptoms on examination; however, in our case, the patient was asymptomatic and the lung examination did not suggest an exacerbation.\n\n【64】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【65】Lung-expansion modalities (eg, postoperative incentive spirometry) are most effective for reducing the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in high-risk patients.\n\n【66】CASE 3\n------\n\n【67】A 62-year-old woman with chronic renal insufficiency is evaluated the day after total hip replacement surgery for recommendations regarding prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). She has recently begun walking again. While she was in surgery, graduated compression stockings were used for DVT prophylaxis. The patient is overweight (body mass index \\[calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared\\], 35 kg/m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> ) and has a creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4).\n\n【68】### Question\n\n【69】Given that the patient has recently become ambulatory, which _one_ of the following is the _best_ approach to DVT prophylaxis?\n\n【70】*   a.\n\n【71】    Unfractionated heparin, 5000 U subcutaneously every 8 hours until hospital discharge\n\n【72】*   b.\n\n【73】    Fondaparinux, 2.5 mg/d subcutaneously for 10 days\n\n【74】*   c.\n\n【75】    Enoxaparin, 30 mg/d subcutaneously for 10 days\n\n【76】*   d.\n\n【77】    Warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 for 4 weeks\n\n【78】*   e0\n\n【79】    Dalteparin, 5000 U/d subcutaneously for 4 weeks\n\n【80】### Discussion\n\n【81】Patients who have hip or knee replacement or hip fracture surgery are at very high risk of developing venous thromboembolism in the perioperative period. Without prophylaxis, 40% to 60% of these patients will develop DVT.\n\n【82】The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on prevention of venous thromboembolism,\n\n【83】Prevention of venous thromboembolism: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th edition).\n\n【84】updated in 2008, recommend the use of LMWH (in a high-risk dose), fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose warfarin (INR, 2.0-3.0) for DVT prophylaxis in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery. The guidelines specifically advise against the use of aspirin, low-dose unfractionated heparin, compression stockings, or venous foot pumps as the sole method of DVT prophylaxis in this high-risk group of patients. The duration of thromboprophylaxis should be extended beyond 10 days and up to 35 days after surgery.\n\n【85】The use of LMWHs and fondaparinux can be difficult in patients with renal insufficiency because renal clearance is the primary mode of elimination. Increased drug accumulation can lead to a substantial bleeding risk. Considerable variation is seen in the relationship between renal impairment and drug accumulation for the different LMWHs, perhaps because of the chain-length distribution of the different LMWH preparations. Many experts recommend avoiding LMWHs altogether in patients with substantial renal insufficiency. However, if LMWHs are used in this patient population, monitoring anti-Xa levels at 4 to 6 hours after administration of the LMWH is recommended if the creatinine clearance rate is less than 30 mL/min. Dose reductions are recommended when using fondaparinux in patients with mild renal insufficiency, but this drug is contraindicated when the creatinine clearance rate is less than 30 mL/min. For our patient, who has a substantial degree of renal insufficiency, warfarin would be the best choice.\n\n【86】### Clinical Pearls\n\n【87】*   1.\n\n【88】    Thromboprophylaxis should be extended beyond 10 days and up to 35 days after total hip or knee replacement surgery or hip fracture repair.\n\n【89】*   2.\n\n【90】    Avoid LMWHs and fondaparinux in patients with a creatinine clearance rate of less than 30 mL/min.\n\n【91】CASE 4\n------\n\n【92】A 65-year-old man with known coronary artery disease is referred for preoperative cardiac risk assessment. After review of the patient's history, you have decided that he needs to have a cardiac stress test preoperatively to help with risk stratification.\n\n【93】### Medications\n\n【94】Lisinopril, 20 mg/d\n\n【95】Aspirin, 81 mg/d\n\n【96】Pravastatin, 40 mg/d\n\n【97】Metoprolol, 50 mg twice daily\n\n【98】The patient's medical history is remarkable for a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction 3 years earlier. He was found to have an 80% left anterior descending (LAD) lesion and was treated with angioplasty and BMS. His history revealed his functional capacity to be about 3 metabolic equivalents. He has a blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg and a regular pulse of 60 beats/min.\n\n【99】Findings on electrocardiography (ECG) are unremarkable except for a left bundle branch block (LBBB) that has not changed since being detected by ECG 2 years earlier.\n\n【100】### Question\n\n【101】Which _one_ of the following stress tests would be _most useful_ in ruling out ischemia in this patient?\n\n【102】*   a.\n\n【103】    Exercise ECG with no imaging\n\n【104】*   b.\n\n【105】    Exercise ECG with thallium imaging\n\n【106】*   c.\n\n【107】    Exercise ECG with sestamibi imaging\n\n【108】*   d.\n\n【109】    Dobutamine stress echocardiography\n\n【110】*   e.\n\n【111】    Pharmacologic vasodilator stress test (dipyridamole or adenosine) with sestamibi imaging\n\n【112】### Discussion\n\n【113】In patients with LBBB, exercise-induced tachycardia may result in reversible septal defects, even in the absence of LAD disease (false-positive test).\n\n【114】ACC/AHA 2007 guidelines on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and care for noncardiac surgery.\n\n【115】The reversible defects are seen in 40% to 50% of patients with LBBB during exercise and are more frequent with faster peak heart rates. Tachycardia induced by dobutamine stress has also been associated with this false-positive reversible anteroseptal defect, although less so. The false-positive septal defect associated with LBBB is thought to occur because of delayed and asynchronous activation of the left side of the septum. Because septal contraction occurs at the end of systole with LBBB, the compressive effects of the septum, as a result in part of delayed ventricular relaxation, could restrict blood flow in early diastole, at which time most myocardial perfusion occurs. Septal hypoperfusion would become more apparent with the exercise-induced tachycardia because diastole is shortened.\n\n【116】Although vasodilator stress can be associated with a slight increase in heart rate, it is not increased to the extent that it is with exercise and is not associated with false-positive findings in patients with LBBB.\n\n【117】In general, dobutamine stress echocardiography is still fairly accurate in patients with LBBB, but this accuracy decreases considerably in patients with LAD disease. The vasodilator stress test with myocardial perfusion imaging is the best choice for this patient because the area of interest is in the LAD distribution.\n\n【118】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【119】The vasodilator stress test with myocardial perfusion studies is recommended as a cardiac stress test for patients with LBBB (especially in the presence of LAD disease).\n\n【120】CASE 5\n------\n\n【121】A 65-year-old man who underwent a total knee arthroplasty 2 days earlier reports feeling well except for mild postoperative knee pain.

Our patient has benign postoperative fever that started within the first 48 hours after surgery and is likely associated with pyrogenic cytokine release due to tissue trauma from surgery. Benign postoperative fever is very common and is the cause of approximately 90% of postoperative fever within the first 48 hours.\n\n【150】The magnitude of the febrile response does not predict if the patient is more likely to have an infection.\n\n【151】In this patient, who is completely asymptomatic, who does not have symptoms of toxicity, and who has no clear focus of infection, observation is the best approach to management because benign postoperative fever will usually resolve spontaneously within 72 hours.\n\n【152】Reserve fever work-up for patients with clinical signs and symptoms of infection. This patient had physical examination findings consistent with atelectasis. Atelectasis does not cause postoperative fever.\n\n【153】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【154】Benign postoperative fever is the most common cause of elevated temperature in the first 48 hours after surgery and resolves spontaneously without therapy.\n\n【155】CASE 6\n------\n\n【156】You are asked to evaluate a 76-year-old woman who is agitated and confused. She had a right L5 foraminotomy and L5-S1 fusion 3 days earlier. Her medical history is remarkable for mixed connective-tissue disease but is otherwise unremarkable. Her usual home medications are prednisone, celecoxib, nortriptyline, warfarin, and tramadol.\n\n【157】On the day of surgery, she had evening confusion and slept little. On postoperative day 1, she did not sleep and had increasing confusion. On postoperative day 2, she did not sleep; was not oriented to time, place, or person; and was agitated and calling out. She has no focal neurologic findings. No underlying cause for delirium was identified by initial work-up.\n\n【158】### Question\n\n【159】Which _one_ of the following is the _best_ treatment option for this patient?\n\n【160】*   a.\n\n【161】    Restraints\n\n【162】*   b.\n\n【163】    Restraints, 24-hour supervision\n\n【164】*   c.\n\n【165】    Restraints, scheduled haloperidol\n\n【166】*   d.\n\n【167】    Protocol to ensure adequate sleep, enlistment of family support, haloperidol for agitation\n\n【168】*   e.\n\n【169】    Protocol to ensure adequate sleep, enlistment of family support, diazepam for sleep\n\n【170】### Discussion\n\n【171】Delirium is quite common postoperatively in the elderly population. Identification and treatment of the underlying cause(s) are essential.\n\n【172】A variety of supportive measures have been shown to be effective in managing delirium. For example, the patient's environment can be controlled, ensuring that lighting is adequate but not excessive, that objects are familiar, that clocks and calendars are present, and that the patient has access to all normal sensory input (with the aid of glasses, dentures, hearing aids). The presence of family members and their help with frequent reorientation can be comforting to the patient. Of course, it is important to ensure adequate nutrition, hydration, oxygenation, and sleep.\n\n【173】When the patient is agitated or aggressive and a concern for patient or staff safety exists, other measures need to be considered. Restraints should generally be avoided if at all possible because they often lead to increased agitation. Pharmacologic measures can be considered for symptom control and safety. Antipsychotic agents have been used for this purpose; however, no drugs have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of delirium. Benzodiazepines should be reserved for treatment of patients with delirium due to alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Both conventional and atypical antipsychotic agents have been used off label for treatment of delirium; however, no convincing evidence has shown that newer antipsychotic agents are any better than haloperidol. Haloperidol is the preferred agent because of its minimal anticholinergic adverse effects and lack of active metabolites. Oral doses can be started quite low (0.25-0.50 mg every 4 hours, as needed) with good response.\n\n【174】In June 2008, the FDA issued a black box warning for conventional (typical) antipsychotic agents indicating their association with increased risk of mortality in elderly patients undergoing short- or long-term treatment with these agents for dementia-related psychosis.\n\n【175】A similar FDA warning for atypical antipsychotic agents preceded this in 2005. Major contributors to the increased mortality were cardiovascular causes and sudden death. If these agents are used for this purpose, physicians are advised that the risk of increased mortality should be clearly discussed with patients and families.\n\n【176】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【177】No drugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of delirium. Antipsychotic agents can be used for symptoms of agitation in patients with delirium, but their use may be associated with increased short- and long-term mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": " 删除19:9  /L", "content": "【0】Clinical Pearls in Perioperative Medicine\nAt the 2001 annual conference of the American College of Physicians, a new teaching format to aid physician learning, Clinical Pearls, was introduced. Clinical Pearls is designed with the 3 qualities of physician-learners in mind. First, we physicians enjoy learning from cases. Second, we like concise, practical points that we can use in our practice. Finally, we take pleasure in problem solving.\n\n【1】In the Clinical Pearls format, speakers present a number of short cases in their specialty to a general internal medicine audience. Each case is followed by a multiple-choice question answered live by attendees using an audience response system. The answer distribution is shown to attendees. The correct answer is then displayed and the speaker discusses teaching points, clarifying why one answer is most appropriate. Each case presentation ends with a _Clinical Pearl_ , defined as a practical teaching point that is supported by the literature but generally not well known to most internists.\n\n【2】CASE 1\n------\n\n【3】A 75-year-old woman presents with a hip fracture. Her medical history is remarkable for coronary artery disease. Two months previously she had a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and had a drug-eluting stent (DES) placed. She has a history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.\n\n【4】### Current Medications\n\n【5】Aspirin, 81 mg/d\n\n【6】Clopidogrel, 75 mg/d\n\n【7】Atorvastatin, 20 mg/d\n\n【8】Metformin, 1000 mg twice daily\n\n【9】Enalapril, 40 mg/d\n\n【10】Hydrochlorothiazide, 25 mg/d\n\n【11】### Question\n\n【12】Which _one_ of the following would be the _most appropriate_ recommendation to the surgeon about this patient's antiplatelet therapy before hip fracture repair?\n\n【13】*   a.\n\n【14】    Do not interrupt aspirin or clopidogrel therapy before surgery\n\n【15】*   b.\n\n【16】    Stop both clopidogrel and aspirin therapy for 5 days before surgery\n\n【17】*   c.\n\n【18】    Stop both clopidogrel and aspirin therapy for 5 days before surgery and bridge with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH)\n\n【19】*   d.\n\n【20】    Stop clopidogrel therapy for 5 days before surgery but do not interrupt aspirin therapy\n\n【21】*   e.\n\n【22】    Delay surgery until the 1-year anniversary of stent placement\n\n【23】### Discussion\n\n【24】Approximately 5% of patients who undergo coronary stenting will require surgery within the year after stent placement. Because of the need for uninterrupted dual antiplatelet therapy after these stents are deployed, elective procedures with a bleeding risk should be deferred. It is recommended that dual antiplatelet therapy be continued without interruption for 4 to 6 weeks after the placement of a bare metal stent (BMS) and for 12 months after a DES to minimize the risk of stent thrombosis.\n\n【25】Prevention of premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery stents.\n\n【26】However, unplanned urgent surgeries may still be necessary during this critical re-endothelialization period. The generally accepted policy is to withdraw antiplatelet agents 7 to 10 days before a surgical or endoscopic procedure because of the fear of excessive bleeding. Premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy markedly increases the risk of stent thrombosis, a catastrophic event that frequently leads to myocardial infarction and/or death. Premature withdrawal of antiplatelet therapy is associated with a 5- to 10-fold increase in the perioperative cardiac death rate, with an average incidence of death of about 30%.\n\n【27】Prevention of premature discontinuation of dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with coronary artery stents.\n\n【28】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【29】The case fatality rate for patients who develop stent thrombosis is 45%.\n\n【30】This obviously puts the physicians, surgeons, and patients in a difficult situation. In this case, it is best to consider the risks and benefits of continuation vs discontinuation of the antiplatelet therapy.\n\n【31】What is the risk of surgical bleeding with antiplatelet agents? Aspirin increases the rate of bleeding complications by 1.5 fold; however, for most surgical procedures, it does not increase the severity of or mortality due to bleeding complications.\n\n【32】The exception would be for intracranial neurosurgical and transurethral prostate procedures. Aspirin in addition to clopidogrel is associated with a 30% to 50% increase in relative risk (absolute risk, 0.4%-1%) of major bleeding perioperatively compared with aspirin alone. Dual antiplatelet therapy does not result in increased operative mortality (except for intracranial neurosurgery) but is associated with a slight increase in the need for reoperation and a 30% increase in the need for transfusion.\n\n【33】Therefore, most operations—with the exception of intracranial neurosurgery—can be performed while the patient is receiving dual antiplatelet therapy without significantly increasing morbidity and mortality. Other operations in which bleeding into a closed space could result in serious complications (ie, spinal cord surgery or posterior chamber eye surgery) should also be considered exceptions.\n\n【34】Another option that is often considered is to stop only the clopidogrel but continue the aspirin therapy. This option may be the most appropriate for patients who have stents and are beyond the critical period of stent endothelialization (6 weeks for BMS, 12 months for DES). However, stopping clopidogrel during the critical period places the patient at increased risk of stent thrombosis, even if aspirin is continued. Aspirin alone is not sufficient to prevent stent thrombosis in patients who are not beyond the critical period of stent endothelialization.\n\n【35】Although some physicians may advocate the use of bridging therapy with glycoprotein 2b/3a inhibiting agents or heparin for the period when the patient is not receiving antiplatelet agents, no data support this practice, nor is there evidence that it actually decreases the risk of stent thrombosis or death.\n\n【36】Given the risks and benefits for this patient, the best option would be to proceed with the surgical procedure without interruption of the antiplatelet agents. The American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines also address this issue in the section on the perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy.\n\n【37】The perioperative management of antithrombotic therapy: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th edition).\n\n【38】These guidelines recommend that patients with a DES who require surgery within 12 months of stent placement continue aspirin and clopidogrel therapy in the perioperative period. Additionally, patients with a BMS who require surgery within 6 weeks of stent placement should also continue aspirin and clopidogrel therapy in the perioperative period.\n\n【39】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【40】Most operations (except neurosurgery) can be performed in patients who have recent coronary artery stents and who are receiving dual antiplatelet therapy without increasing mortality.\n\n【41】CASE 2\n------\n\n【42】A 62-year-old man presents for an evaluation before an open cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis under general anesthesia. He has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and obstructive sleep apnea and is actively smoking. He has no history of coronary artery disease. His functional capacity is about 4 to 5 metabolic equivalents. His inhalers include ipratropium, salmeterol, and albuterol, as needed. He uses continuous positive airway pressure at night. Pulmonary function testing 1 year previously revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 60% of predicted.\n\n【43】### Findings on Examination\n\n【44】Oxygen saturation, 91% while breathing room air\n\n【45】Lungs: prolonged expiration phase, otherwise clear\n\n【46】Unremarkable findings on remainder of examination\n\n【47】### Question\n\n【48】Which _one_ of the following strategies will _most effectively_ reduce this patient's risk of postoperative pulmonary complications?\n\n【49】*   a.\n\n【50】    Smoking cessation\n\n【51】*   b.\n\n【52】    Postoperative incentive spirometry\n\n【53】*   c.\n\n【54】    Switching to a laparoscopic surgical technique\n\n【55】*   d.\n\n【56】    Postoperative nasogastric decompression\n\n【57】*   e.\n\n【58】    Preoperative oral corticosteroid therapy\n\n【59】### Discussion\n\n【60】This patient has multiple risk factors that increase his risk of postoperative pulmonary complications, including COPD, current smoking, age, upper abdominal surgical procedure, general anesthesia, and obstructive sleep apnea. To help decrease his risk of pulmonary complications in the postoperative period, several strategies can be considered, including lung-specific strategies, operative technique, anesthesia technique, and postoperative strategies.\n\n【61】In 2006, Lawrence et al\n\n【62】published a systematic review of strategies to reduce pulmonary complications after noncardiothoracic surgery for the American College of Physicians. In this review, the authors reported the strength of the evidence for specific interventions to reduce the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. The best evidence exists for lung-expansion therapy (eg, incentive spirometry, deep breathing exercises, and continuous positive airway pressure) for reducing pulmonary risk after abdominal surgery. However, the comparative effectiveness of different lung-expansion modalities has not been well studied. Strategies of probable benefit are selective nasogastric tube decompression after abdominal surgery and the use of short-acting neuromuscular blocking agents during anesthesia. Strategies of possible benefit include a laparoscopic rather than an open surgical approach for abdominal surgeries; however, the evidence is insufficient to determine whether laparoscopic procedures prevent clinically important pulmonary complications. Strategies of unclear benefit include preoperative smoking cessation. The authors reported no benefit with the routine use of parenteral or enteral hyperalimentation or with the use of invasive perioperative monitoring with pulmonary artery catheterization.\n\n【63】Preoperative use of oral corticosteroids is probably effective in decreasing postoperative pulmonary complications in patients with COPD who have uncontrolled symptoms on examination; however, in our case, the patient was asymptomatic and the lung examination did not suggest an exacerbation.\n\n【64】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【65】Lung-expansion modalities (eg, postoperative incentive spirometry) are most effective for reducing the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in high-risk patients.\n\n【66】CASE 3\n------\n\n【67】A 62-year-old woman with chronic renal insufficiency is evaluated the day after total hip replacement surgery for recommendations regarding prophylaxis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT). She has recently begun walking again. While she was in surgery, graduated compression stockings were used for DVT prophylaxis. The patient is overweight (body mass index \\[calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared\\], 35 kg/m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> ) and has a creatinine level of 3.5 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4).\n\n【68】### Question\n\n【69】Given that the patient has recently become ambulatory, which _one_ of the following is the _best_ approach to DVT prophylaxis?\n\n【70】*   a.\n\n【71】    Unfractionated heparin, 5000 U subcutaneously every 8 hours until hospital discharge\n\n【72】*   b.\n\n【73】    Fondaparinux, 2.5 mg/d subcutaneously for 10 days\n\n【74】*   c.\n\n【75】    Enoxaparin, 30 mg/d subcutaneously for 10 days\n\n【76】*   d.\n\n【77】    Warfarin with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.0 to 3.0 for 4 weeks\n\n【78】*   e0\n\n【79】    Dalteparin, 5000 U/d subcutaneously for 4 weeks\n\n【80】### Discussion\n\n【81】Patients who have hip or knee replacement or hip fracture surgery are at very high risk of developing venous thromboembolism in the perioperative period. Without prophylaxis, 40% to 60% of these patients will develop DVT.\n\n【82】The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on prevention of venous thromboembolism,\n\n【83】Prevention of venous thromboembolism: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines (8th edition).\n\n【84】updated in 2008, recommend the use of LMWH (in a high-risk dose), fondaparinux, or adjusted-dose warfarin (INR, 2.0-3.0) for DVT prophylaxis in patients undergoing hip replacement surgery. The guidelines specifically advise against the use of aspirin, low-dose unfractionated heparin, compression stockings, or venous foot pumps as the sole method of DVT prophylaxis in this high-risk group of patients. The duration of thromboprophylaxis should be extended beyond 10 days and up to 35 days after surgery.\n\n【85】The use of LMWHs and fondaparinux can be difficult in patients with renal insufficiency because renal clearance is the primary mode of elimination. Increased drug accumulation can lead to a substantial bleeding risk. Considerable variation is seen in the relationship between renal impairment and drug accumulation for the different LMWHs, perhaps because of the chain-length distribution of the different LMWH preparations. Many experts recommend avoiding LMWHs altogether in patients with substantial renal insufficiency. However, if LMWHs are used in this patient population, monitoring anti-Xa levels at 4 to 6 hours after administration of the LMWH is recommended if the creatinine clearance rate is less than 30 mL/min. Dose reductions are recommended when using fondaparinux in patients with mild renal insufficiency, but this drug is contraindicated when the creatinine clearance rate is less than 30 mL/min. For our patient, who has a substantial degree of renal insufficiency, warfarin would be the best choice.\n\n【86】### Clinical Pearls\n\n【87】*   1.\n\n【88】    Thromboprophylaxis should be extended beyond 10 days and up to 35 days after total hip or knee replacement surgery or hip fracture repair.\n\n【89】*   2.\n\n【90】    Avoid LMWHs and fondaparinux in patients with a creatinine clearance rate of less than 30 mL/min.\n\n【91】CASE 4\n------\n\n【92】A 65-year-old man with known coronary artery disease is referred for preoperative cardiac risk assessment. After review of the patient's history, you have decided that he needs to have a cardiac stress test preoperatively to help with risk stratification.\n\n【93】### Medications\n\n【94】Lisinopril, 20 mg/d\n\n【95】Aspirin, 81 mg/d\n\n【96】Pravastatin, 40 mg/d\n\n【97】Metoprolol, 50 mg twice daily\n\n【98】The patient's medical history is remarkable for a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction 3 years earlier. He was found to have an 80% left anterior descending (LAD) lesion and was treated with angioplasty and BMS. His history revealed his functional capacity to be about 3 metabolic equivalents. He has a blood pressure of 140/80 mm Hg and a regular pulse of 60 beats/min.\n\n【99】Findings on electrocardiography (ECG) are unremarkable except for a left bundle branch block (LBBB) that has not changed since being detected by ECG 2 years earlier.\n\n【100】### Question\n\n【101】Which _one_ of the following stress tests would be _most useful_ in ruling out ischemia in this patient?\n\n【102】*   a.\n\n【103】    Exercise ECG with no imaging\n\n【104】*   b.\n\n【105】    Exercise ECG with thallium imaging\n\n【106】*   c.\n\n【107】    Exercise ECG with sestamibi imaging\n\n【108】*   d.\n\n【109】    Dobutamine stress echocardiography\n\n【110】*   e.\n\n【111】    Pharmacologic vasodilator stress test (dipyridamole or adenosine) with sestamibi imaging\n\n【112】### Discussion\n\n【113】In patients with LBBB, exercise-induced tachycardia may result in reversible septal defects, even in the absence of LAD disease (false-positive test).\n\n【114】ACC/AHA 2007 guidelines on perioperative cardiovascular evaluation and care for noncardiac surgery.\n\n【115】The reversible defects are seen in 40% to 50% of patients with LBBB during exercise and are more frequent with faster peak heart rates. Tachycardia induced by dobutamine stress has also been associated with this false-positive reversible anteroseptal defect, although less so. The false-positive septal defect associated with LBBB is thought to occur because of delayed and asynchronous activation of the left side of the septum. Because septal contraction occurs at the end of systole with LBBB, the compressive effects of the septum, as a result in part of delayed ventricular relaxation, could restrict blood flow in early diastole, at which time most myocardial perfusion occurs. Septal hypoperfusion would become more apparent with the exercise-induced tachycardia because diastole is shortened.\n\n【116】Although vasodilator stress can be associated with a slight increase in heart rate, it is not increased to the extent that it is with exercise and is not associated with false-positive findings in patients with LBBB.\n\n【117】In general, dobutamine stress echocardiography is still fairly accurate in patients with LBBB, but this accuracy decreases considerably in patients with LAD disease. The vasodilator stress test with myocardial perfusion imaging is the best choice for this patient because the area of interest is in the LAD distribution.\n\n【118】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【119】The vasodilator stress test with myocardial perfusion studies is recommended as a cardiac stress test for patients with LBBB (especially in the presence of LAD disease).\n\n【120】CASE 5\n------\n\n【121】A 65-year-old man who underwent a total knee arthroplasty 2 days earlier reports feeling well except for mild postoperative knee pain.

Both conventional and atypical antipsychotic agents have been used off label for treatment of delirium; however, no convincing evidence has shown that newer antipsychotic agents are any better than haloperidol. Haloperidol is the preferred agent because of its minimal anticholinergic adverse effects and lack of active metabolites. Oral doses can be started quite low (0.25-0.50 mg every 4 hours, as needed) with good response.\n\n【174】In June 2008, the FDA issued a black box warning for conventional (typical) antipsychotic agents indicating their association with increased risk of mortality in elderly patients undergoing short- or long-term treatment with these agents for dementia-related psychosis.\n\n【175】A similar FDA warning for atypical antipsychotic agents preceded this in 2005. Major contributors to the increased mortality were cardiovascular causes and sudden death. If these agents are used for this purpose, physicians are advised that the risk of increased mortality should be clearly discussed with patients and families.\n\n【176】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【177】No drugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of delirium. Antipsychotic agents can be used for symptoms of agitation in patients with delirium, but their use may be associated with increased short- and long-term mortality.", "index": 18219, "show": true, "start": 18219, "end": 18230, "province": ["语义有效性", "错误删除"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:19:45", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:20:48", "cost": 62.563}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:33", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:20:48", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:19:45"}

The primary outcome of this study was gastrointestinal bleeding that occurred during hospitalization, diagnosed by physicians and recorded in medical records at the time of occurrence. The secondary outcome was all-type bleeding, either documented bleeding or defined as a decline in hemoglobin level of 4 g/dL or more during hospitalization. Patients taking PPIs were reported to have a higher rate of all-type bleeding (2.9% vs 1.8%; _P_ <.001) in comparison to individuals not taking PPIs. After multivariable adjustment, PPI use was still associated with a 38% increased risk of all-type bleeding among all patients with ACS (odds ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.66; _P_ <.001). This study, which has obvious strengths, delivers results that are interesting but surprising. To reevaluate the association between PPI use and in-hospital outcomes (eg, variables of participating hospital, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart and cerebrovascular disease history, pre-hospital treatment with antiplatelet drugs, or in-hospital loading status of DAPT), the authors conducted propensity score–matched analysis, which revealed that the rates of gastrointestinal bleeding and all-type bleeding remained higher in patients taking PPIs (gastrointestinal bleeding: 0.8% vs 0.6% \\[ _P_ \\=.04\\]; all-type bleeding: 2.6% vs 1.9% \\[ _P_ \\=.002\\]; PPI vs no PPI, respectively). There are several limitations to this study that include the probability of observational and selection bias along with residual measured or unmeasured confounding factors (eg, relatively small odds ratios reported by the authors may result from lurking variables), the lack of examination to locate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding (especially the lack of the evaluation of the impact of PPI therapy on gastrointestinal bleeding in the small intestine), and the lack of reporting of some significant risk factors (eg _Helicobacter pylori_ infection status). Nevertheless, this report carries important clinical implications. In accordance with the current recommendations, DAPT is frequently prescribed with PPIs to minimize aspirin/P2Y <sub>12 </sub> antagonist–related adverse effects in the upper gastrointestinal tract. The clinical benefit of this coadministration is regarded as obvious and safe and has come to be viewed as standard medical practice. However, the data are mounting on the adverse and harmful effects of DAPT on the small intestine augmented by prescription of PPIs. The PPIs suppress gastric acid secretion, effectively reducing aspirin-related damage in the stomach and duodenum, but without any proven benefit in the prevention of aspirin-related damage in the lower gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, both aspirin and PPIs alter the small intestinal microbiome and gastrointestinal barrier integrity, which contributes to the injury of the small bowel mucosa and may be responsible for clinically significant complications. Zheng et al\n\n【9】Long-term dual antiplatelet-induced intestinal injury resulting in translocation of intestinal bacteria into blood circulation increased the incidence of adverse events after PCI in patients with coronary artery disease.\n\n【10】documented that long-term DAPT significantly increased the incidence of both ischemic and bleeding events after percutaneous coronary intervention. Their study indicated that DAPT is responsible for intestinal injury, followed by translocation of intestinal bacteria into the bloodstream, increasing the incidence of adverse events after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with coronary artery disease.\n\n【11】Long-term dual antiplatelet-induced intestinal injury resulting in translocation of intestinal bacteria into blood circulation increased the incidence of adverse events after PCI in patients with coronary artery disease.\n\n【12】Metabolic endotoxemia has previously been associated with the development and progression of cardiovascular disease and atherosclerosis. Prospective data from the Bruneck study, conducted more than 2 decades ago, delivered early evidence linking the risk of atherosclerosis with bacterial endotoxemia.\n\n【13】Association of endotoxemia with carotid atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease: prospective results from the Bruneck Study.\n\n【14】Antibiotic treatments in patients shortly after a first coronary event in the STAMINA (South Thames Trial of Antibiotics in Myocardial Infarction and Unstable Angina) and ROXIS (Roxithromycin in Ischemic Syndromes) trials were associated with overall risk reduction of secondary end points, counted as recurrent ischemia, myocardial infarction, or ischemic death. However, the data from more recent studies delivered contrasting results for the role of antibiotics in patients with ACS.\n\n【15】Antibiotic therapy after acute myocardial infarction: a prospective randomized study.\n\n【16】Nevertheless, current evidence linking gut microbiome with mucosal injury and cardiovascular disease is mounting. As the pathogenesis of many chronic diseases revolves around microbiome and gut barrier alterations, the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been associated with increased rates of myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, and stroke. Relevant are the insights from the China Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry in a study by Shi et al\n\n【17】The clinical impact of proton pump inhibitors when co-administered with dual antiplatelet therapy in patients having acute myocardial infarction with low risk of gastrointestinal bleeding: insights from the China Acute Myocardial Infarction registry.\n\n【18】on the clinical impact of PPIs coadministered with DAPT in patients with ACS and low risk of bleeding. This study reported the prevalent use of PPIs in patients receiving DAPT and found no extragastrointestinal protective effect while revealing an increased risk of stroke observed during the 2-year follow-up.\n\n【19】What are the conclusions and take-home message for medical practitioners taking care and involved in the management of patients with ACS? The results from meta-analysis of efficacy and safety of PPIs with DAPT for coronary artery disease are contrasting. Analysis restricted to randomized clinical trials found that PPIs reduce the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (relative risk \\[RR\\], 0.32; _P_ <.001; _I_ <sup><em>2 </em></sup> \\=0), which contrasts with data from observational studies, which show that PPIs significantly increase the risk of all-cause mortality (RR, 1.25; _P_ <.001; _I_ <sup><em>2 </em></sup> \\=82), without reducing gastrointestinal bleeding risk (RR, 0.74; _P_ \\=.24; _I_ <sup><em>2 </em></sup> \\=79).\n\n【20】Meta-analysis of efficacy and safety of proton pump inhibitors with dual antiplatelet therapy for coronary artery disease.\n\n【21】The data from recently published secondary analysis of the prospective COMPASS (The Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies) trial confirmed that use of PPIs during the period of 3 years was safe except for a possible increased risk for enteric infection.\n\n【22】The quest for optimal gastrointestinal protection in patients with ACS is open and does not concern only PPI safety but also, and importantly so, their efficacy in the prevention of overall gastrointestinal bleeding. The latest 2021 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions guideline for coronary revascularization urges clinicians to weigh the risks of bleeding and recurrent ischemia when determining the choice and protocol of DAPT.\n\n【23】In the recent randomized clinical trial OPT-PEACE (Optimal Antiplatelet Therapy for Prevention of Gastrointestinal Injury), which maintained DAPT for 6 months followed by single antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel from 6 to 12 months, resulted in less gastrointestinal mucosal injury and clinical bleeding compared with DAPT through 12 months.\n\n【24】Magnetically controlled capsule endoscopy for assessment of antiplatelet therapy-induced gastrointestinal injury.\n\n【25】Physicians should aim for best possible stratification of patients at high risk of gastrointestinal bleeding (eg, patients with a past history of gastrointestinal bleeding). The PPIs are registered as drugs used for prevention of gastroduodenal ulcers induced by NSAIDs in patients at risk with a need for continuous NSAID treatment. The quest is also about finding other agents capable of protecting the mucosa in the gastrointestinal tract in areas in addition to the stomach and duodenum and against harmful effects of DAPT. Beyond PPIs, other measures have to be implemented to protect small bowel tract mucosa. Microbiota modulation is one innovative and promising method of such holistic care. Several bacterial strains have already been tested in humans to try to reverse aspirin/NSAID-related enteropathy, to maintain the gut barrier, and to prevent mucosal damage in the small intestine. Based on available data, the question of full safety of both drugs (DAPT and PPIs) administered together is still incomplete. Future preclinical and clinical trials—including gastrointestinal microbiome and metabolome testing along with capsule endoscopy evaluation of small bowel mucosal injury—in patients taking DAPT and PPIs are essential in answering the most relevant questions of optimal care of patients with ACS.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:17:11", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:17:45", "cost": 33.955}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:33", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:17:44", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:17:10"}

Their comment that “no one experienced in this area would have expected to find a simple relationship” between PA concentration and PRA is the essence of the argument against the ARR. The concomitant effects of potassium and corticotropin also underscore the advocates’ disconnect in logic, since they do not propose dividing PA concentration by these other influential covariates.\n\n【2】The admonition that the ARR should be measured twice exposes another weakness inherent to a calculation based on measurements that vary considerably within an individual.

Previous reports have confirmed interference with bingo wands, stereo speakers, and various workplace sources. In the 4 patients in this report, we document inadvertent alteration of the tachyarrhythmia detection function of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) that occurred in health care settings because of deliberately applied magnetic fields. Three of these patients had pectorally implanted ICDs that may have been confused with pacemakers, and 2 patients had undergone office surgical procedures at which time a magnet had been applied over the device. These events stemmed from (1) potential confusion by health care workers about the nature of the implanted device and (2) unique features in a specific manufacturer's defibrillator. We recommend the following steps to avoid such problems: (1) when device programming hardware and trained personnel are readily available, the patient's device should be interrogated and reprogrammed before and after any procedure involving electrocautery; (2) patients with ICDs should be monitored during device inactivation because they are unprotected from potentially life-threatening arrhythmias during this period; and (3) if the clinical situation does not allow device interrogation and reprogramming, the patient should be monitored electrocardiographically during magnet application and the device interrogated as soon as possible after magnet removal.\n\n【1】ECG ( electrocardiogram ), ICD ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator )\n\n【2】Patients who receive implantable pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) are routinely cautioned to avoid exposure to magnetic fields because such exposure can temporarily affect device function or, less commonly, reprogram the device. Environmental sources of such electromagnetic interference include portable electric tools, certain engine parts (alternators), and magnets in games and science sets.\n\n【3】In many hospital and outpatient settings, deliberate magnet application over a pacemaker pulse generator is performed routinely to assess battery status or pacemaker function. During recording of the electrocardiogram (ECG), standard practice is to obtain an ECG “with and without magnet” for this purpose. In addition, in clinical settings in which electrocautery might be used (major or minor surgery), continuous application of a magnet over the pacemaker inhibits sensing of cardiac or noncardiac electrical events causing the pacemaker to revert to fixed-rate pacing. This protects the patient from inappropriate inhibition of pacer output and inappropriate tracking of sensed electrical signal events during electrocautery procedures.\n\n【4】We describe 4 patients who were referred for evaluation of ICD function in whom magnet application over ICD pulse generators in health care settings altered device function and, in 1 instance, inhibited potentially lifesaving automatic defibrillation. This outcome likely resulted from confusion about the behavior of pacemakers and ICDs with magnet application. Key differences between the magnet response of ICDs and pacemakers are emphasized.\n\n【5】METHODS\n-------\n\n【6】Three of the cases in this report were obtained from a device clinic that monitors approximately 500 patients with ICDs; 1 patient was referred from an institution elsewhere specifically for ICD evaluation. The cases were identified over approximately a 2-year period. In 2 of the patients, detailed medical records from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, were available for review; in the other 2 patients, magnet application occurred in clinical settings at institutions elsewhere. In all patients device interrogation indicated that the tachyarrhythmia detection had been altered by a magnet.\n\n【7】REPORT OF CASES\n---------------\n\n【8】### Case 1\n\n【9】A 76-year-old man had an abdominally placed ICD (model 1746, Guidant Corp, St Paul, Minn) and was monitored at a facility elsewhere. He underwent ICD evaluation as part of a preoperative examination at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn, in June 1998, with the intent to inhibit sensing temporarily during the planned surgery. Interrogation showed that the “tachy mode” had been changed with a magnet on February 27, 1998. At that time, the patient had undergone an outpatient surgical procedure at a facility elsewhere and recalled having a magnet applied over his ICD.\n\n【10】### Case 2\n\n【11】A 61-year-old man with an ICD (model 1743, Guidant Corp) placed pectorally underwent routine ICD follow-up at Mayo Clinic in Rochester in May 1998. Interrogation showed that the “tachy mode” had been changed with a magnet on November 19, 1997. Medical chart review showed that the patient had undergone excision of a skin lesion with application of electrocautery on that date. The patient recalled having had a magnet applied to his ICD at the time of the procedure. Routine interrogation in November 1997 showed that the device had been programmed to “monitor + therapy” with the “change tachy mode with magnet” feature enabled.\n\n【12】### Case 3\n\n【13】A 61-year-old man with an ICD (model 1743, Guidant Corp) placed pectorally died while sleeping. Postmortem interrogation of the ICD revealed that the tachycardia detection had been disabled with a magnet 3 months before his death, when he had been evaluated at an emergency department elsewhere . At device interrogation at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester 4 months before his death, tachycardia detection had been active and the “change tachy mode with magnet” feature enabled. The coincidence of the date of inactivation and the date of the patient's evaluation at the hospital elsewhere indicates that magnet application at that time had deactivated the device.\n\n【14】Figure 1 Case 3. Printout from Guidant programmer (Guidant Corp, St Paul, Minn) indicating deactivation of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator by magnet.\n\n【15】### Case 4\n\n【16】A 78-year-old man with an ICD (model 1740, Guidant Corp) placed pectorally was admitted for congestive heart failure. At the time of a bradycardic event in the intensive care unit at a referring hospital, an attempt was made to increase the pacing rate with application of a magnet over the device. After transfer to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, device interrogation showed that the “tachy mode” had been changed with a magnet and that the tachyarrhythmia detection was inactive.\n\n【17】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【18】In these 4 patients, ICD function was altered inadvertently by exposure to magnetic fields in health care settings. All devices were made by a single manufacturer and incorporated a programmable feature that allows alteration of device function with application of a magnet over the device canister. In 1 patient, potentially life-saving defibrillator therapy was disabled. This report highlights the need for full interrogation and programming of devices before and after procedures involving electrocautery and the limited situations in which magnet application over ICDs is appropriate.\n\n【19】Inadvertent ICD deactivation by magnetic fields has been reported previously with devices such as bingo wands,\n\n【20】Inadvertent AICD inactivation while playing bingo.\n\n【21】stereo speakers,\n\n【22】and workplace environments.\n\n【23】As shown in the current series, deliberate exposure to magnetic fields may occur in health care settings when ICDs are confused with antibradycardia pacing systems with respect to their behavior with magnet application. This confusion may be due to similarities of size, shape, and implant location as well as the increasingly sophisticated pacemaker functions of ICDs.\n\n【24】Magnet application over a pacemaker closes a reed switch that changes the pacemaker to an asynchronous mode (VOO, DOO, AOO). This provides information about residual battery life (so-called magnet rate) and allows electrocautery to be used without concern about altering pacing function. In many (but not all) pacemakers, magnet rates are typically greater than programmed lower rates. In many pacemakers application of a magnet can increase the pacing rate promptly, as in case 4.\n\n【25】Magnet application over ICD pulse generators alters the pacing rate only in devices made by ELA Medical LLC (Plymouth, Minn). In these ICDs, application of a magnet causes pacing in the DDD mode at 96 beats/min. In all ICDs, magnet application temporarily inhibits all therapy delivery and detection of arrhythmias or electrical noise, which is necessary to avoid delivery of shocks during electrocautery. In devices made by Guidant Corp, the cardioverter-defibrillator functions of the device can be inactivated by a magnet applied for 30 seconds if the “change tachy mode with magnet” feature is programmed “on” . Reprogramming by trained personnel or reapplication of a magnet for 30 seconds is then necessary to reactivate the defibrillator functions of the device. Device inactivation by a magnet is indicated by emission of a continuous tone during application. Reactivation is indicated by emission of R-wave synchronous beeps from the device while the magnet is applied.\n\n【26】Figure 2 Programmer screen for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (Guidant Corp, St Paul, Minn) showing options for magnet use. Note that “Enable Magnet Use” allows _temporary_ inhibition of tachyarrhythmia sensing and must be distinguished from “Change Tachy Mode with Magnet.” EGM = electrogram; ERI = elective replacement index.\n\n【27】Medtronic Inc (Bloomington, Minn) recently released a device for temporary inhibition of its defibrillators that incorporates telemetry and light-emitting diodes to indicate that device detection is inhibited. However, such a device would not recognize other manufacturers’ devices, although the generated magnetic field could alter device function as any magnetic field might.\n\n【28】In a recent survey\n\n【29】of cutaneous surgeons regarding precautions and complications in the use of electrosurgery in patients with pacemakers and defibrillators, only 15% of respondents reported routine deactivation of ICDs before procedures. The most commonly employed precautions were the use of brief bursts of energy at low power and avoidance of application in proximity to implanted devices. Twenty-five complications were reported, including 4 ICD discharges.\n\n【30】Medical personnel in a wide variety of clinical arenas should be cognizant of the differences between ICDs and pacemaker systems and the different behavior of these devices with magnet application . Patients themselves may equate defibrillators with pacemakers despite educational efforts. Hence, relying on history alone may be insufficient. When a patient cannot provide a clearly accurate medical history or an identification card for the device, chest radiography can easily distinguish between the 2 devices. Both systems may have leads in the atrium and ventricle, and both may be placed in the upper chest area. Pacemaker leads have very small electrodes near the distal end of the leads . However, ICD leads have large coil electrodes in the right ventricle and, in some systems, in the right atrium and superior vena cava . Magnet application over all ICD pulse generators will inhibit sensing and antitachycardia therapy during the period of magnet application. However, it is important to interrogate the device after the procedure to confirm that sensing and antitachycardia therapies are active.\n\n【31】Table 1 Effects of Magnet Application on Pacemakers and ICDs\n\n【32】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【33】ICD = implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.\n\n| Function | Pacemaker | Defibrillator |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Pacing | Reverts to asynchronous pacing (increased rate in some devices with decrement in output in first 3 beats \\[threshold margin test\\]) | Unaffected except in ELA Medical LLC (Plymouth, Minn) devices, which pace DDD at 96 beats/min |\n| Sensing | Inhibited.

Small arrowhead indicates atrial pacing lead. Large arrowheads indicate defibrillator lead coils in the right atrium and right ventricle.\n\n【38】Our early practice had been to activate the “change tachy mode with magnet” feature to allow remote referring facilities without ready access to ICD programmers to turn devices off in the event of frequent inappropriate shocks due to atrial fibrillation or patient or family request, eg, terminal illness in a patient with advance directives. As a result of the current observations and increased availability of programmers and industry support personnel, we do not enable the “change tachy mode with magnet” feature in any Guidant ICDs. (Of note, in the default programming of these devices, this feature is disabled.) When programmed in such a manner, device deactivation requires use of a programmer and trained personnel. Additionally, we have notified hospital departments where magnet application might occur to query patients closely about their devices and contact us for device management.\n\n【39】Health care workers should be alert to the important differences between ICDs and pacemakers and consider the following guidelines.\n\n【40】1\\. When device programming hardware and trained personnel are readily available, the patient's device should be interrogated before and after any procedure involving electrocautery or magnet application.\n\n【41】2\\. Patients with ICDs should be monitored during device inactivation because they are unprotected from potentially life-threatening arrhythmias during this period.\n\n【42】3\\. If there is doubt about the nature of the device or the clinical situation does not allow device interrogation before magnet application, the patient should be monitored with use of an ECG during magnet application and the device interrogated after magnet removal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:34:42", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:35:30", "cost": 47.996}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:33", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:35:30", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:34:42"}

However, traditional side-by-side visual interpretation of ictal and interictal SPECT films is hampered by differences in slice location and tracer activity. Precise correlation of the seizure focus with a high-quality image of the underlying brain anatomy can improve the physician's understanding of seizure neurophysiology and assist in surgical planning. Computer-based methods have been developed for aligning, normalizing, and subtracting digital ictal and interictal SPECT images of the patient's brain to produce a map of the blood flow changes occurring between the seizure and resting states. These maps are then aligned with a high-resolution magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the patient's brain anatomy and fused to identify anatomical regions involved in the seizure.

We present a brief overview of the mechanisms and types of pain as well as current and new approaches to its management.\n\n【31】Mechanisms and Types of Cancer Pain\n-----------------------------------\n\n【32】Cancer pain is the result of complex interactions among cancer cells, the peripheral and central nervous systems, and the immune system.\n\n【33】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【34】Cancer cells and the local immune cells produce a wide range of substances that mediate or interact with pain receptors (nociceptors). As more is understood about the functioning of these molecules in the pain signal transduction process, they have emerged as important targets for novel analgesic interventions.\n\n【35】Additionally, in animals, and likely in humans, peripheral nociceptors appear to become activated, sensitized, or injured in the presence of certain cancers.\n\n【36】Once pain receptors are stimulated, impulses are transmitted first by afferent A-delta (thinly myelinated) fibers and then by separate slower (nonmyelinated) C fibers. These fibers end in cell bodies in the dorsal root or trigeminal ganglion, which then interact with neurons in the central nervous system cells in the spinal cord. These cells synapse to the contralateral thalamus from which impulses are transmitted to regions of the cortex via somatosensory pathways. Interactions at the cortical level are highly complex, involving the somatosensory cortex, frontal cortex, and limbic system. Each transmission implies some chance to block the pain signal at that point.\n\n【37】The observation that perceptions of pain can vary depending on factors (anxiety, depression, distraction) that have no direct relationship to nociceptors or the painful stimulus indicates the presence of additional mechanisms that modulate transduction and response.\n\n【38】These mechanisms include inhibition at the spinal level by nonpainful input (the gate control theory\n\n【39】) and descending inhibition from midbrain and higher regions that contain high concentrations of opioid receptors. Visceral pain arising from nociceptors in internal organs is mostly transmitted by C fibers. Often less well localized and less sharp than somatic pain, visceral pain is triggered by direct irritation from the tumor, distention or contraction of an organ, ischemia, necrosis, or inflammatory mediators.\n\n【40】Neuropathic pain arises from injury to nerve tissue in either the central or peripheral nervous system. It differs from nociceptive pain in several important ways. First, the inciting stimulus may be gone, so there is nothing to “fix” at the nociceptor. Second, the pain stimulus can arise at any place along the pathway, eg, peripheral, spinal cord, or even central areas. Finally, chronic neuropathic pain may serve no protective purpose. These mechanisms are discussed in an excellent review by Cohen and Mao.\n\n【41】Such pain is less likely to respond to standard opioid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)–based therapy.\n\n【42】Neuropathic pain is also complicated by the “wind-up” phenomena\n\n【43】: repetitive stimulation of the C fibers leads to biochemical and physical genetic changes in the central nervous system.\n\n【44】In fact, the damaged nerves and their undamaged counterparts may both be giving pain signals by cross talk mediated by gap junctions,\n\n【45】reinforcing the pain stimulus.\n\n【46】In patients with cancer, such injury often arises as a result of treatment (chemotherapy, surgical procedure, or radiotherapy) but can also be caused by infection, direct action of the tumor, ischemia, or a combination of these factors. Unlike somatic or visceral pain, the quality of neuropathic pain is often described as burning, numbness, or tingling and may be further diagnosed as allodynic (caused by stimuli that do not normally trigger pain) or hyperalgesic (pain perception that is much greater than would be expected). The distinction between nociceptive pain (somatic and visceral) and neuropathic pain is clinically important because different therapeutic approaches are often needed to achieve relief.\n\n【47】Cancer pain can be readily categorized on the basis of the mechanism of nerve damage or type of sensation, but most pain is actually mixed . In our own study of refractory cancer pain in 5 countries, 60% of patients had mixed pain.\n\n【48】An implantable drug delivery system (IDDS) for refractory cancer pain provides sustained pain control, less drug-related toxicity, and possibly better survival compared with comprehensive medical management (CMM).\n\n【49】It is important to try to discern the cause of the pain—the “pain generator”—because consequences and treatment options vary tremendously. For instance, local pain from a T12 vertebral metastatic tumor should mandate concern about an epidural mass causing spinal cord compression. In addition, the pain may be well controlled with injections of a local anesthetic or, if mostly neuropathic, from a combination of opioids and neuropathic drugs.\n\n【50】Table 1 Types of Commonly Encountered Cancer Pain\n\n| Type of pain | Cause | Characteristics | Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nociceptive | Pressure on nerves | Deep, dull, aching, constant, and worsening with time | Pancreas cancer, deep boring, and epigastric |\n| Visceral | Distention of a hollow viscus | Cramping, bloating pain, intermittent | Intestinal obstruction, renal colic |\n\n| Incident or movement pain | Pathologic fractures, bone damage from cancer, residual damage left after cancer | Minimal pain at rest but excruciating pain with movement “bone on bone” | Very difficult to control.

The World Health Organization's cancer pain ladder for adults\n\n【63】recognizes 3 fundamental categories of analgesics—nonopioids (aspirin, acetaminophen, paracetamol, or NSAIDs), “weak” opioids (codeine), and strong opioids (morphine, hydromorphone, and others)—and 3 levels of pain (mild, mild-moderate, and moderate-severe). Mild pain is treated with nonopioids, mild-moderate pain with “weak” opioids with or without a nonopioid, and moderate-severe pain with strong opioids with or without nonopioids. Adjuvant medications are recommended on an ad hoc basis. The World Health Organization's cancer pain ladder for adults recommends around-the-clock dosing of analgesics with provision for break-through or rescue doses, adaption of regimens based on individual needs, patient education, and administration via the oral route when possible. We commonly use some modifications to these recommendations. These modifications include the use of low doses of strong opioids for mild-moderate pain (elimination of step 2 on the ladder, especially the use of codeine, because 10% of patients do not metabolize these medications to the active component, as now recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network\n\n【64】), concerns about long-term use of NSAIDs on renal and cardiac health, validation of various routes of administration, the addition of a fourth step of interventions for severe and intractable pain, and specific recognition of neuropathic pain requiring a different approach.\n\n【65】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【66】Some available modalities of treatment are provided in Tables 3 and 4 .\n\n【67】Table 3 Standard Ways of Relieving Cancer Pain With Drugs\n\n| Method | Current uses | Effectiveness | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n【69】NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; RCT = randomized controlled trial.\n\n【70】Table 4 Nondrug Pain Treatments\n\n【71】Modified from Springer-Verlag.\n\n| Method | Current uses | Effectiveness | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n| Nerve blocks | Celiac and other plexus blocks, local injections | In general, about a 75% chance of success, with the ability to repeat in the future if needed | See Table 5 |\n\n|  | Peripheral nerve stimulation | Appears similar to spinal cord stimulation but with no randomized trials | Insertion of sterile electrodes around the painful area, with stimulation across the area of pain. Not widely available |\n\n【75】At least 15% of patients will not experience pain relief with pain medication or will have severe adverse effects. In these patients, nerve blocks or other interventional procedures are needed . In our experience, many health care professionals have little experience with the power of nerve blocks. We describe a splanchnic nerve block to our patients in simple terms: “Remember when the dentist put some Novocain into your cheek and your teeth suddenly stopped feeling pain? Same principle. You will know if it works right away, and if it does, you will ask why we did not do this months ago.”\n\n【76】Table 5 Summary of Evidence for Intra-abdominal and Ganglion Nerve Blocks\n\n【77】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【78】CRPS = complex regional pain syndrome; IV = intravenous; PHN = postherpetic neuralgia.\n\n【79】Modified from _Ann Oncol_ .\n\n| Type of block | Indication | Effect on pain | Adverse effects |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n【81】a CRPS = complex regional pain syndrome; IV = intravenous; PHN = postherpetic neuralgia.\n\n【82】b Only visceral pain responds, not bone or muscle pain from the same region.\n\n【83】Some common practices in pain management that should be avoided are presented in Table 6 .\n\n【84】Table 6 Common Mistakes in Cancer Pain Management\n\n| Mistake | Remedy | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【86】Step 3: Prevention and Management of Adverse Effects\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【87】There are important opiate-induced adverse effects to anticipate, prevent, and educate patients and families about. Some are predictable and expected such as constipation, fuzzy-headedness, and mild nausea. Most patients with pain will need a stool stimulant or softener; however, for hospice patients, there is no advantage to using a stool softener.\n\n【88】If opioid induced, constipation refractory to an aggressive bowel regimen can also be managed with the use of methylnaltrexone, a modification of naltrexone that does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore will not reverse analgesia. In the most recent placebo-controlled trial, 63% of patients achieved a bowel movement with use of methylnaltrexone compared with just 9% in those receiving placebo.\n\n【89】The primary adverse effect of methylnaltrexone is the expense.\n\n【90】The management of nausea and vomiting associated with opioid use is based on practical experience and nonrandomized trials. The available evidence suggests that dopamine antagonists such as prochlorperazine or metoclopramide may be the most effective, available, and inexpensive; serotonin-blocking ondansetron can be effective but is much more expensive and can be constipating.\n\n【91】Unresolved Clinical Questions and Future Directions\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【92】The biggest unresolved issue in pain management is neuropathic pain because of relatively ineffective drugs, some placebo response, publication bias, and no major “winners.”\n\n【93】Pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【94】Long after the stimulus is gone, the nerve is still sending a danger signal that can be disabling.\n\n【95】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【96】Pilot evaluation of Scrambler therapy for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【97】and 95% pain relief in postherpetic neuralgia, failed back syndrome, and spinal cord stenosis\n\n【98】with no toxicity.

The primary barriers for effective pain management include (1) inadequate pain assessment and management training (lack of awareness of one's own knowledge deficits), (2) failure to refer patients to pain management specialists, (3) patient reluctance and poor adherence (not covered in this review), and (4) poor reimbursement for nonprocedural pain management (not covered in this review). These barriers are in addition to the complexities of pain itself.\n\n【108】Specific actions that providers can take are to always do a thorough pain assessment, learn to use both opioids and adjunctive medications, tailor neuropathic pain treatments to the cause of the pain, and refer patients to pain specialists earlier and more often.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【11】删除21:Worldwide, those estimates were 32.6 million in 2012.\n\n【12】删除21:Cancer incidence and mortality worldwide: sources, methods and major patterns in GLOBOCAN 2012.", "content": "【0】Abstract\n--------\n\n【1】Safe, effective, and evidence-based management of cancer-related pain is a cornerstone of comprehensive cancer care. Despite increasing interest in and efforts to improve its management, pain remains poorly controlled in nearly half of all patients with cancer, with little change in the past 20 years. Limited training in pain assessment and management, overestimation of providers' own skills to treat pain, and failure to refer patients to pain specialists can result in suboptimal pain management with devastating effects on quality of life, physical functioning, and increased psychological distress.

Oncologists rated their training in pain management as a score of 3 (on a scale of 0 to 10) in medical school and 5 in residency but gave themselves a 7 for cancer pain expertise. Oncologists performed worse than pain specialists on pain vignettes, with 60% and 87% giving answers that would be unacceptable to pain specialists on 2 challenging cases.\n\n【22】A recent update with 8 vignettes was more concerning when oncologists were compared with pain management specialists and palliative medicine specialists.\n\n【23】How well do medical oncologists manage chronic cancer pain? a national survey.\n\n【24】Oncologists did worse than either group in selection of an opioid, management of opioid adverse effects, management of a pain crisis, use of a coanalgesic to treat neuropathic pain, and use of interventions such as nerve blocks. Despite their lower scores on these vignettes, oncologists rated their own skills at 7 of 10, while pain specialists rated their skills at 6. Contemporary oncology practice results indicate less than optimal management as well.

Mild pain is treated with nonopioids, mild-moderate pain with “weak” opioids with or without a nonopioid, and moderate-severe pain with strong opioids with or without nonopioids. Adjuvant medications are recommended on an ad hoc basis. The World Health Organization's cancer pain ladder for adults recommends around-the-clock dosing of analgesics with provision for break-through or rescue doses, adaption of regimens based on individual needs, patient education, and administration via the oral route when possible. We commonly use some modifications to these recommendations. These modifications include the use of low doses of strong opioids for mild-moderate pain (elimination of step 2 on the ladder, especially the use of codeine, because 10% of patients do not metabolize these medications to the active component, as now recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network\n\n【64】), concerns about long-term use of NSAIDs on renal and cardiac health, validation of various routes of administration, the addition of a fourth step of interventions for severe and intractable pain, and specific recognition of neuropathic pain requiring a different approach.\n\n【65】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【66】Some available modalities of treatment are provided in Tables 3 and 4 .\n\n【67】Table 3 Standard Ways of Relieving Cancer Pain With Drugs\n\n| Method | Current uses | Effectiveness | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n【69】NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; RCT = randomized controlled trial.\n\n【70】Table 4 Nondrug Pain Treatments\n\n【71】Modified from Springer-Verlag.\n\n| Method | Current uses | Effectiveness | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n| Nerve blocks | Celiac and other plexus blocks, local injections | In general, about a 75% chance of success, with the ability to repeat in the future if needed | See Table 5 |\n\n|  | Peripheral nerve stimulation | Appears similar to spinal cord stimulation but with no randomized trials | Insertion of sterile electrodes around the painful area, with stimulation across the area of pain.

Some are predictable and expected such as constipation, fuzzy-headedness, and mild nausea. Most patients with pain will need a stool stimulant or softener; however, for hospice patients, there is no advantage to using a stool softener.\n\n【88】If opioid induced, constipation refractory to an aggressive bowel regimen can also be managed with the use of methylnaltrexone, a modification of naltrexone that does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore will not reverse analgesia. In the most recent placebo-controlled trial, 63% of patients achieved a bowel movement with use of methylnaltrexone compared with just 9% in those receiving placebo.\n\n【89】The primary adverse effect of methylnaltrexone is the expense.\n\n【90】The management of nausea and vomiting associated with opioid use is based on practical experience and nonrandomized trials.

Two-thirds of patients report that pain interferes with their activities of daily living, and half believe that their providers do not prioritize quality of life in their overall plan of care.\n\n【20】Cancer-related pain: a pan-European survey of prevalence, treatment, and patient attitudes.\n\n【21】These figures stand in stark contrast with oncologists' perceptions of their ability to manage pain. Oncologists rated their training in pain management as a score of 3 (on a scale of 0 to 10) in medical school and 5 in residency but gave themselves a 7 for cancer pain expertise. Oncologists performed worse than pain specialists on pain vignettes, with 60% and 87% giving answers that would be unacceptable to pain specialists on 2 challenging cases.\n\n【22】A recent update with 8 vignettes was more concerning when oncologists were compared with pain management specialists and palliative medicine specialists.\n\n【23】How well do medical oncologists manage chronic cancer pain? a national survey.\n\n【24】Oncologists did worse than either group in selection of an opioid, management of opioid adverse effects, management of a pain crisis, use of a coanalgesic to treat neuropathic pain, and use of interventions such as nerve blocks. Despite their lower scores on these vignettes, oncologists rated their own skills at 7 of 10, while pain specialists rated their skills at 6. Contemporary oncology practice results indicate less than optimal management as well. Even in practices that were being self-monitored for pain management, one-third of patients with cancer pain had inadequate prescriptions for pain, despite 20 years of emphasis on cancer pain relief.\n\n【25】Prospective, observational study of pain and analgesic prescribing in medical oncology outpatients with breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer.\n\n【26】Minority patients had twice as much difficulty: in this national study of 6 academic and 32 community practices, the chances of a white patient getting inadequate pain prescription was half that of a minority patient (odds ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37-0.70; _P_ \\=.002).

We present a brief overview of the mechanisms and types of pain as well as current and new approaches to its management.\n\n【31】Mechanisms and Types of Cancer Pain\n-----------------------------------\n\n【32】Cancer pain is the result of complex interactions among cancer cells, the peripheral and central nervous systems, and the immune system.\n\n【33】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【34】Cancer cells and the local immune cells produce a wide range of substances that mediate or interact with pain receptors (nociceptors). As more is understood about the functioning of these molecules in the pain signal transduction process, they have emerged as important targets for novel analgesic interventions.\n\n【35】Additionally, in animals, and likely in humans, peripheral nociceptors appear to become activated, sensitized, or injured in the presence of certain cancers.\n\n【36】Once pain receptors are stimulated, impulses are transmitted first by afferent A-delta (thinly myelinated) fibers and then by separate slower (nonmyelinated) C fibers. These fibers end in cell bodies in the dorsal root or trigeminal ganglion, which then interact with neurons in the central nervous system cells in the spinal cord. These cells synapse to the contralateral thalamus from which impulses are transmitted to regions of the cortex via somatosensory pathways. Interactions at the cortical level are highly complex, involving the somatosensory cortex, frontal cortex, and limbic system. Each transmission implies some chance to block the pain signal at that point.\n\n【37】The observation that perceptions of pain can vary depending on factors (anxiety, depression, distraction) that have no direct relationship to nociceptors or the painful stimulus indicates the presence of additional mechanisms that modulate transduction and response.\n\n【38】These mechanisms include inhibition at the spinal level by nonpainful input (the gate control theory\n\n【39】) and descending inhibition from midbrain and higher regions that contain high concentrations of opioid receptors. Visceral pain arising from nociceptors in internal organs is mostly transmitted by C fibers. Often less well localized and less sharp than somatic pain, visceral pain is triggered by direct irritation from the tumor, distention or contraction of an organ, ischemia, necrosis, or inflammatory mediators.\n\n【40】Neuropathic pain arises from injury to nerve tissue in either the central or peripheral nervous system. It differs from nociceptive pain in several important ways. First, the inciting stimulus may be gone, so there is nothing to “fix” at the nociceptor. Second, the pain stimulus can arise at any place along the pathway, eg, peripheral, spinal cord, or even central areas. Finally, chronic neuropathic pain may serve no protective purpose. These mechanisms are discussed in an excellent review by Cohen and Mao.\n\n【41】Such pain is less likely to respond to standard opioid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)–based therapy.\n\n【42】Neuropathic pain is also complicated by the “wind-up” phenomena\n\n【43】: repetitive stimulation of the C fibers leads to biochemical and physical genetic changes in the central nervous system.\n\n【44】In fact, the damaged nerves and their undamaged counterparts may both be giving pain signals by cross talk mediated by gap junctions,\n\n【45】reinforcing the pain stimulus.\n\n【46】In patients with cancer, such injury often arises as a result of treatment (chemotherapy, surgical procedure, or radiotherapy) but can also be caused by infection, direct action of the tumor, ischemia, or a combination of these factors. Unlike somatic or visceral pain, the quality of neuropathic pain is often described as burning, numbness, or tingling and may be further diagnosed as allodynic (caused by stimuli that do not normally trigger pain) or hyperalgesic (pain perception that is much greater than would be expected). The distinction between nociceptive pain (somatic and visceral) and neuropathic pain is clinically important because different therapeutic approaches are often needed to achieve relief.\n\n【47】Cancer pain can be readily categorized on the basis of the mechanism of nerve damage or type of sensation, but most pain is actually mixed . In our own study of refractory cancer pain in 5 countries, 60% of patients had mixed pain.\n\n【48】An implantable drug delivery system (IDDS) for refractory cancer pain provides sustained pain control, less drug-related toxicity, and possibly better survival compared with comprehensive medical management (CMM).\n\n【49】It is important to try to discern the cause of the pain—the “pain generator”—because consequences and treatment options vary tremendously. For instance, local pain from a T12 vertebral metastatic tumor should mandate concern about an epidural mass causing spinal cord compression. In addition, the pain may be well controlled with injections of a local anesthetic or, if mostly neuropathic, from a combination of opioids and neuropathic drugs.\n\n【50】Table 1 Types of Commonly Encountered Cancer Pain\n\n| Type of pain | Cause | Characteristics | Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nociceptive | Pressure on nerves | Deep, dull, aching, constant, and worsening with time | Pancreas cancer, deep boring, and epigastric |\n| Visceral | Distention of a hollow viscus | Cramping, bloating pain, intermittent | Intestinal obstruction, renal colic |\n\n| Incident or movement pain | Pathologic fractures, bone damage from cancer, residual damage left after cancer | Minimal pain at rest but excruciating pain with movement “bone on bone” | Very difficult to control. See Table 3 |\n\n【53】The First Step: Assessment of Pain\n----------------------------------\n\n【54】An editorial commenting on an article in the _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ that reported no progress in pain management in the past 20 years called for “ensuring that every consultation includes the patient's rating of pain, that the oncologist pays attention to the answer, and that there is an agreed-upon plan to increase analgesia when it is inadequate.”\n\n【55】We agree but believe that a pain rating alone is insufficient.

Nerve, plexus, root or cord? | Try to isolate the pain origin to control it with nerve blocks, local treatments |\n| What does it feel like? | Dull, aching (nociceptive) or sharp and stabbing associated with tingling (neuropathic) | Neuropathic pain requires nerve medications. We describe it to patients as being like treating seizures: we are trying to quiet down the nerve over some weeks |\n| How long does it last? | Searching for pain generators | Pain that lasts seconds, only with bone movement, indicates bone instability or damage |\n| What makes it better or worse? | Searching for pain generators and mechanism | If heat, cold, or massage works, then local treatments may help |\n| Does touching the skin hurt? | Allodynia—pain on normal touch—indicates neuropathic pain | Treat with neuropathic drugs and look for a spot to administer a local nerve block or try topical treatments |\n| Is there associated numbness and tingling? | Indicates nerve damage such as a plexopathy or chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy | Patients may not tell you about these symptoms unless you ask |\n| What has worked or not before? | Make a list of potential things to try; do not include things that the patient has tried that were not effective | It is very hard to convince a patient with a serious adverse reaction to a drug, eg, delirium or urinary hesitancy, to try it again |\n| What adverse effects have you experienced with pain medications? | Sedation, constipation, delirium, pruritus, nausea | Understanding predictable adverse effects allows for better teaching |\n| What impact has it had on your life? | Does the pain restrict activity? The pain may be less because the person never goes outside or tries to walk | Do they think it means the cancer is growing and so will not report it? Is their pain controlled but they never go outside anymore? |\n| Please rate your pain on a scale of 0 to 10 | A number. Every patient can at least say if the pain is well controlled or not well controlled | Even though this is the fifth vital sign, the score is less important than the mechanism. Getting the pain score down to 0 is often impossible, but patients function well if the pain score is ≤4 |\n| Are there major risks of respiratory or organ dysfunction that limit choice? | Liver disease, kidney disease, allergies, high doses of serotonin drugs | Influences prescribing and may need consultation with a pain or palliative care expert and pharmacist |\n| Are there red flags for potential abuse? | Prior drug addiction or misuse,multiple prescribers, pain out of keeping with the known anatomy and physiology | Every prescriber should be able to use their available prescription drug monitoring plan.

We present a brief overview of the mechanisms and types of pain as well as current and new approaches to its management.\n\n【31】Mechanisms and Types of Cancer Pain\n-----------------------------------\n\n【32】Cancer pain is the result of complex interactions among cancer cells, the peripheral and central nervous systems, and the immune system.\n\n【33】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【34】Cancer cells and the local immune cells produce a wide range of substances that mediate or interact with pain receptors (nociceptors). As more is understood about the functioning of these molecules in the pain signal transduction process, they have emerged as important targets for novel analgesic interventions.\n\n【35】Additionally, in animals, and likely in humans, peripheral nociceptors appear to become activated, sensitized, or injured in the presence of certain cancers.\n\n【36】Once pain receptors are stimulated, impulses are transmitted first by afferent A-delta (thinly myelinated) fibers and then by separate slower (nonmyelinated) C fibers. These fibers end in cell bodies in the dorsal root or trigeminal ganglion, which then interact with neurons in the central nervous system cells in the spinal cord. These cells synapse to the contralateral thalamus from which impulses are transmitted to regions of the cortex via somatosensory pathways. Interactions at the cortical level are highly complex, involving the somatosensory cortex, frontal cortex, and limbic system. Each transmission implies some chance to block the pain signal at that point.\n\n【37】The observation that perceptions of pain can vary depending on factors (anxiety, depression, distraction) that have no direct relationship to nociceptors or the painful stimulus indicates the presence of additional mechanisms that modulate transduction and response.\n\n【38】These mechanisms include inhibition at the spinal level by nonpainful input (the gate control theory\n\n【39】) and descending inhibition from midbrain and higher regions that contain high concentrations of opioid receptors. Visceral pain arising from nociceptors in internal organs is mostly transmitted by C fibers. Often less well localized and less sharp than somatic pain, visceral pain is triggered by direct irritation from the tumor, distention or contraction of an organ, ischemia, necrosis, or inflammatory mediators.\n\n【40】Neuropathic pain arises from injury to nerve tissue in either the central or peripheral nervous system. It differs from nociceptive pain in several important ways. First, the inciting stimulus may be gone, so there is nothing to “fix” at the nociceptor. Second, the pain stimulus can arise at any place along the pathway, eg, peripheral, spinal cord, or even central areas. Finally, chronic neuropathic pain may serve no protective purpose. These mechanisms are discussed in an excellent review by Cohen and Mao.\n\n【41】Such pain is less likely to respond to standard opioid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)–based therapy.\n\n【42】Neuropathic pain is also complicated by the “wind-up” phenomena\n\n<mark>【43】: repetitive stimulation</mark> of the C fibers leads to biochemical and physical genetic changes in the central nervous system.\n\n【44】In fact, the damaged nerves and their undamaged counterparts may both be giving pain signals by cross talk mediated by gap junctions,\n\n【45】reinforcing the pain stimulus.\n\n【46】In patients with cancer, such injury often arises as a result of treatment (chemotherapy, surgical procedure, or radiotherapy) but can also be caused by infection, direct action of the tumor, ischemia, or a combination of these factors. Unlike somatic or visceral pain, the quality of neuropathic pain is often described as burning, numbness, or tingling and may be further diagnosed as allodynic (caused by stimuli that do not normally trigger pain) or hyperalgesic (pain perception that is much greater than would be expected). The distinction between nociceptive pain (somatic and visceral) and neuropathic pain is clinically important because different therapeutic approaches are often needed to achieve relief.\n\n【47】Cancer pain can be readily categorized on the basis of the mechanism of nerve damage or type of sensation, but most pain is actually mixed . In our own study of refractory cancer pain in 5 countries, 60% of patients had mixed pain.\n\n【48】An implantable drug delivery system (IDDS) for refractory cancer pain provides sustained pain control, less drug-related toxicity, and possibly better survival compared with comprehensive medical management (CMM).\n\n【49】It is important to try to discern the cause of the pain—the “pain generator”—because consequences and treatment options vary tremendously. For instance, local pain from a T12 vertebral metastatic tumor should mandate concern about an epidural mass causing spinal cord compression. In addition, the pain may be well controlled with injections of a local anesthetic or, if mostly neuropathic, from a combination of opioids and neuropathic drugs.\n\n【50】Table 1 Types of Commonly Encountered Cancer Pain\n\n| Type of pain | Cause | Characteristics | Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nociceptive | Pressure on nerves | Deep, dull, aching, constant, and worsening with time | Pancreas cancer, deep boring, and epigastric |\n| Visceral | Distention of a hollow viscus | Cramping, bloating pain, intermittent | Intestinal obstruction, renal colic |\n\n| Incident or movement pain | Pathologic fractures, bone damage from cancer, residual damage left after cancer | Minimal pain at rest but excruciating pain with movement “bone on bone” | Very difficult to control. See Table 3 |\n\n【53】The First Step: Assessment of Pain\n----------------------------------\n\n【54】An editorial commenting on an article in the _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ that reported no progress in pain management in the past 20 years called for “ensuring that every consultation includes the patient's rating of pain, that the oncologist pays attention to the answer, and that there is an agreed-upon plan to increase analgesia when it is inadequate.”\n\n【55】We agree but believe that a pain rating alone is insufficient. Table 2 listed the common questions that we use in our pain assessment, modified to be practical and usable.\n\n【56】Table 2 Questions for Pain Assessment in Adults With Cancer Pain\n\n【57】Data from UpToDate.\n\n| Question | Searching for | What to do with the response |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n| When did it start? | Searching for the cause of the pain | Determine if it started before or after the surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or shingles |\n| Where is it? | Searching for the causeSymmetry? Nerve, plexus, root or cord? | Try to isolate the pain origin to control it with nerve blocks, local treatments |\n| What does it feel like? | Dull, aching (nociceptive) or sharp and stabbing associated with tingling (neuropathic) | Neuropathic pain requires nerve medications. We describe it to patients as being like treating seizures: we are trying to quiet down the nerve over some weeks |\n| How long does it last? | Searching for pain generators | Pain that lasts seconds, only with bone movement, indicates bone instability or damage |\n| What makes it better or worse? | Searching for pain generators and mechanism | If heat, cold, or massage works, then local treatments may help |\n| Does touching the skin hurt? | Allodynia—pain on normal touch—indicates neuropathic pain | Treat with neuropathic drugs and look for a spot to administer a local nerve block or try topical treatments |\n| Is there associated numbness and tingling? | Indicates nerve damage such as a plexopathy or chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy | Patients may not tell you about these symptoms unless you ask |\n| What has worked or not before? | Make a list of potential things to try; do not include things that the patient has tried that were not effective | It is very hard to convince a patient with a serious adverse reaction to a drug, eg, delirium or urinary hesitancy, to try it again |\n| What adverse effects have you experienced with pain medications? | Sedation, constipation, delirium, pruritus, nausea | Understanding predictable adverse effects allows for better teaching |\n| What impact has it had on your life? | Does the pain restrict activity? The pain may be less because the person never goes outside or tries to walk | Do they think it means the cancer is growing and so will not report it? Is their pain controlled but they never go outside anymore? |\n| Please rate your pain on a scale of 0 to 10 | A number. Every patient can at least say if the pain is well controlled or not well controlled | Even though this is the fifth vital sign, the score is less important than the mechanism. Getting the pain score down to 0 is often impossible, but patients function well if the pain score is ≤4 |\n| Are there major risks of respiratory or organ dysfunction that limit choice? | Liver disease, kidney disease, allergies, high doses of serotonin drugs | Influences prescribing and may need consultation with a pain or palliative care expert and pharmacist |\n| Are there red flags for potential abuse? | Prior drug addiction or misuse,multiple prescribers, pain out of keeping with the known anatomy and physiology | Every prescriber should be able to use their available prescription drug monitoring plan. A full review of their use is beyond the scope of this review |\n\n【60】Modified from questions used by Judith Paice, RN, MSN, PhD, Northwestern University.\n\n【61】The Second Step: Management of the Pain\n---------------------------------------\n\n【62】Once pain is assessed, treatment may begin. The World Health Organization's cancer pain ladder for adults\n\n【63】recognizes 3 fundamental categories of analgesics—nonopioids (aspirin, acetaminophen, paracetamol, or NSAIDs), “weak” opioids (codeine), and strong opioids (morphine, hydromorphone, and others)—and 3 levels of pain (mild, mild-moderate, and moderate-severe). Mild pain is treated with nonopioids, mild-moderate pain with “weak” opioids with or without a nonopioid, and moderate-severe pain with strong opioids with or without nonopioids. Adjuvant medications are recommended on an ad hoc basis. The World Health Organization's cancer pain ladder for adults recommends around-the-clock dosing of analgesics with provision for break-through or rescue doses, adaption of regimens based on individual needs, patient education, and administration via the oral route when possible. We commonly use some modifications to these recommendations. These modifications include the use of low doses of strong opioids for mild-moderate pain (elimination of step 2 on the ladder, especially the use of codeine, because 10% of patients do not metabolize these medications to the active component, as now recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network\n\n【64】), concerns about long-term use of NSAIDs on renal and cardiac health, validation of various routes of administration, the addition of a fourth step of interventions for severe and intractable pain, and specific recognition of neuropathic pain requiring a different approach.\n\n【65】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【66】Some available modalities of treatment are provided in Tables 3 and 4 .\n\n【67】Table 3 Standard Ways of Relieving Cancer Pain With Drugs\n\n| Method | Current uses | Effectiveness | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n【69】NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; RCT = randomized controlled trial.\n\n【70】Table 4 Nondrug Pain Treatments\n\n【71】Modified from Springer-Verlag.\n\n| Method | Current uses | Effectiveness | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n| Nerve blocks | Celiac and other plexus blocks, local injections | In general, about a 75% chance of success, with the ability to repeat in the future if needed | See Table 5 |\n\n|  | Peripheral nerve stimulation | Appears similar to spinal cord stimulation but with no randomized trials | Insertion of sterile electrodes around the painful area, with stimulation across the area of pain. Not widely available |\n\n【75】At least 15% of patients will not experience pain relief with pain medication or will have severe adverse effects. In these patients, nerve blocks or other interventional procedures are needed . In our experience, many health care professionals have little experience with the power of nerve blocks. We describe a splanchnic nerve block to our patients in simple terms: “Remember when the dentist put some Novocain into your cheek and your teeth suddenly stopped feeling pain? Same principle. You will know if it works right away, and if it does, you will ask why we did not do this months ago.”\n\n【76】Table 5 Summary of Evidence for Intra-abdominal and Ganglion Nerve Blocks\n\n【77】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【78】CRPS = complex regional pain syndrome; IV = intravenous; PHN = postherpetic neuralgia.\n\n【79】Modified from _Ann Oncol_ .\n\n| Type of block | Indication | Effect on pain | Adverse effects |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n【81】a CRPS = complex regional pain syndrome; IV = intravenous; PHN = postherpetic neuralgia.\n\n【82】b Only visceral pain responds, not bone or muscle pain from the same region.\n\n【83】Some common practices in pain management that should be avoided are presented in Table 6 .\n\n【84】Table 6 Common Mistakes in Cancer Pain Management\n\n| Mistake | Remedy | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【86】Step 3: Prevention and Management of Adverse Effects\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【87】There are important opiate-induced adverse effects to anticipate, prevent, and educate patients and families about. Some are predictable and expected such as constipation, fuzzy-headedness, and mild nausea. Most patients with pain will need a stool stimulant or softener; however, for hospice patients, there is no advantage to using a stool softener.\n\n【88】If opioid induced, constipation refractory to an aggressive bowel regimen can also be managed with the use of methylnaltrexone, a modification of naltrexone that does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore will not reverse analgesia. In the most recent placebo-controlled trial, 63% of patients achieved a bowel movement with use of methylnaltrexone compared with just 9% in those receiving placebo.\n\n【89】The primary adverse effect of methylnaltrexone is the expense.\n\n【90】The management of nausea and vomiting associated with opioid use is based on practical experience and nonrandomized trials. The available evidence suggests that dopamine antagonists such as prochlorperazine or metoclopramide may be the most effective, available, and inexpensive; serotonin-blocking ondansetron can be effective but is much more expensive and can be constipating.\n\n【91】Unresolved Clinical Questions and Future Directions\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【92】The biggest unresolved issue in pain management is neuropathic pain because of relatively ineffective drugs, some placebo response, publication bias, and no major “winners.”\n\n【93】Pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【94】Long after the stimulus is gone, the nerve is still sending a danger signal that can be disabling.\n\n【95】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【96】Pilot evaluation of Scrambler therapy for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【97】and 95% pain relief in postherpetic neuralgia, failed back syndrome, and spinal cord stenosis\n\n【98】with no toxicity.

The primary barriers for effective pain management include (1) inadequate pain assessment and management training (lack of awareness of one's own knowledge deficits), (2) failure to refer patients to pain management specialists, (3) patient reluctance and poor adherence (not covered in this review), and (4) poor reimbursement for nonprocedural pain management (not covered in this review).

It differs from nociceptive pain in several important ways. First, the inciting stimulus may be gone, so there is nothing to “fix” at the nociceptor. Second, the pain stimulus can arise at any place along the pathway, eg, peripheral, spinal cord, or even central areas. Finally, chronic neuropathic pain may serve no protective purpose. These mechanisms are discussed in an excellent review by Cohen and Mao.\n\n【41】Such pain is less likely to respond to standard opioid or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)–based therapy.\n\n【42】Neuropathic pain is also complicated by the “wind-up” phenomena\n\n<mark>【43】: repetitive stimulation</mark> of the C fibers leads to biochemical and physical genetic changes in the central nervous system.\n\n【44】In fact, the damaged nerves and their undamaged counterparts may both be giving pain signals by cross talk mediated by gap junctions,\n\n【45】reinforcing the pain stimulus.\n\n【46】In patients with cancer, such injury often arises as a result of treatment (chemotherapy, surgical procedure, or radiotherapy) but can also be caused by infection, direct action of the tumor, ischemia, or a combination of these factors. Unlike somatic or visceral pain, the quality of neuropathic pain is often described as burning, numbness, or tingling and may be further diagnosed as allodynic (caused by stimuli that do not normally trigger pain) or hyperalgesic (pain perception that is much greater than would be expected). The distinction between nociceptive pain (somatic and visceral) and neuropathic pain is clinically important because different therapeutic approaches are often needed to achieve relief.\n\n【47】Cancer pain can be readily categorized on the basis of the mechanism of nerve damage or type of sensation, but most pain is actually mixed . In our own study of refractory cancer pain in 5 countries, 60% of patients had mixed pain.\n\n【48】An implantable drug delivery system (IDDS) for refractory cancer pain provides sustained pain control, less drug-related toxicity, and possibly better survival compared with comprehensive medical management (CMM).\n\n【49】It is important to try to discern the cause of the pain—the “pain generator”—because consequences and treatment options vary tremendously. For instance, local pain from a T12 vertebral metastatic tumor should mandate concern about an epidural mass causing spinal cord compression. In addition, the pain may be well controlled with injections of a local anesthetic or, if mostly neuropathic, from a combination of opioids and neuropathic drugs.\n\n【50】Table 1 Types of Commonly Encountered Cancer Pain\n\n| Type of pain | Cause | Characteristics | Examples |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Nociceptive | Pressure on nerves | Deep, dull, aching, constant, and worsening with time | Pancreas cancer, deep boring, and epigastric |\n| Visceral | Distention of a hollow viscus | Cramping, bloating pain, intermittent | Intestinal obstruction, renal colic |\n\n| Incident or movement pain | Pathologic fractures, bone damage from cancer, residual damage left after cancer | Minimal pain at rest but excruciating pain with movement “bone on bone” | Very difficult to control. See Table 3 |\n\n【53】The First Step: Assessment of Pain\n----------------------------------\n\n【54】An editorial commenting on an article in the _Journal of Clinical Oncology_ that reported no progress in pain management in the past 20 years called for “ensuring that every consultation includes the patient's rating of pain, that the oncologist pays attention to the answer, and that there is an agreed-upon plan to increase analgesia when it is inadequate.”\n\n【55】We agree but believe that a pain rating alone is insufficient. Table 2 listed the common questions that we use in our pain assessment, modified to be practical and usable.\n\n【56】Table 2 Questions for Pain Assessment in Adults With Cancer Pain\n\n【57】Data from UpToDate.\n\n| Question | Searching for | What to do with the response |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n| When did it start? | Searching for the cause of the pain | Determine if it started before or after the surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or shingles |\n| Where is it? | Searching for the causeSymmetry? Nerve, plexus, root or cord? | Try to isolate the pain origin to control it with nerve blocks, local treatments |\n| What does it feel like? | Dull, aching (nociceptive) or sharp and stabbing associated with tingling (neuropathic) | Neuropathic pain requires nerve medications. We describe it to patients as being like treating seizures: we are trying to quiet down the nerve over some weeks |\n| How long does it last? | Searching for pain generators | Pain that lasts seconds, only with bone movement, indicates bone instability or damage |\n| What makes it better or worse? | Searching for pain generators and mechanism | If heat, cold, or massage works, then local treatments may help |\n| Does touching the skin hurt? | Allodynia—pain on normal touch—indicates neuropathic pain | Treat with neuropathic drugs and look for a spot to administer a local nerve block or try topical treatments |\n| Is there associated numbness and tingling? | Indicates nerve damage such as a plexopathy or chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy | Patients may not tell you about these symptoms unless you ask |\n| What has worked or not before? | Make a list of potential things to try; do not include things that the patient has tried that were not effective | It is very hard to convince a patient with a serious adverse reaction to a drug, eg, delirium or urinary hesitancy, to try it again |\n| What adverse effects have you experienced with pain medications? | Sedation, constipation, delirium, pruritus, nausea | Understanding predictable adverse effects allows for better teaching |\n| What impact has it had on your life? | Does the pain restrict activity? The pain may be less because the person never goes outside or tries to walk | Do they think it means the cancer is growing and so will not report it? Is their pain controlled but they never go outside anymore? |\n| Please rate your pain on a scale of 0 to 10 | A number. Every patient can at least say if the pain is well controlled or not well controlled | Even though this is the fifth vital sign, the score is less important than the mechanism. Getting the pain score down to 0 is often impossible, but patients function well if the pain score is ≤4 |\n| Are there major risks of respiratory or organ dysfunction that limit choice? | Liver disease, kidney disease, allergies, high doses of serotonin drugs | Influences prescribing and may need consultation with a pain or palliative care expert and pharmacist |\n| Are there red flags for potential abuse? | Prior drug addiction or misuse,multiple prescribers, pain out of keeping with the known anatomy and physiology | Every prescriber should be able to use their available prescription drug monitoring plan.

The World Health Organization's cancer pain ladder for adults\n\n【63】recognizes 3 fundamental categories of analgesics—nonopioids (aspirin, acetaminophen, paracetamol, or NSAIDs), “weak” opioids (codeine), and strong opioids (morphine, hydromorphone, and others)—and 3 levels of pain (mild, mild-moderate, and moderate-severe). Mild pain is treated with nonopioids, mild-moderate pain with “weak” opioids with or without a nonopioid, and moderate-severe pain with strong opioids with or without nonopioids. Adjuvant medications are recommended on an ad hoc basis. The World Health Organization's cancer pain ladder for adults recommends around-the-clock dosing of analgesics with provision for break-through or rescue doses, adaption of regimens based on individual needs, patient education, and administration via the oral route when possible. We commonly use some modifications to these recommendations. These modifications include the use of low doses of strong opioids for mild-moderate pain (elimination of step 2 on the ladder, especially the use of codeine, because 10% of patients do not metabolize these medications to the active component, as now recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network\n\n【64】), concerns about long-term use of NSAIDs on renal and cardiac health, validation of various routes of administration, the addition of a fourth step of interventions for severe and intractable pain, and specific recognition of neuropathic pain requiring a different approach.\n\n【65】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【66】Some available modalities of treatment are provided in Tables 3 and 4 .\n\n【67】Table 3 Standard Ways of Relieving Cancer Pain With Drugs\n\n| Method | Current uses | Effectiveness | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n【69】NSAID = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; RCT = randomized controlled trial.\n\n【70】Table 4 Nondrug Pain Treatments\n\n【71】Modified from Springer-Verlag.\n\n| Method | Current uses | Effectiveness | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n| Nerve blocks | Celiac and other plexus blocks, local injections | In general, about a 75% chance of success, with the ability to repeat in the future if needed | See Table 5 |\n\n|  | Peripheral nerve stimulation | Appears similar to spinal cord stimulation but with no randomized trials | Insertion of sterile electrodes around the painful area, with stimulation across the area of pain. Not widely available |\n\n【75】At least 15% of patients will not experience pain relief with pain medication or will have severe adverse effects. In these patients, nerve blocks or other interventional procedures are needed . In our experience, many health care professionals have little experience with the power of nerve blocks. We describe a splanchnic nerve block to our patients in simple terms: “Remember when the dentist put some Novocain into your cheek and your teeth suddenly stopped feeling pain? Same principle. You will know if it works right away, and if it does, you will ask why we did not do this months ago.”\n\n【76】Table 5 Summary of Evidence for Intra-abdominal and Ganglion Nerve Blocks\n\n【77】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【78】CRPS = complex regional pain syndrome; IV = intravenous; PHN = postherpetic neuralgia.\n\n【79】Modified from _Ann Oncol_ .\n\n| Type of block | Indication | Effect on pain | Adverse effects |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n\n【81】a CRPS = complex regional pain syndrome; IV = intravenous; PHN = postherpetic neuralgia.\n\n【82】b Only visceral pain responds, not bone or muscle pain from the same region.\n\n【83】Some common practices in pain management that should be avoided are presented in Table 6 .\n\n【84】Table 6 Common Mistakes in Cancer Pain Management\n\n| Mistake | Remedy | Evidence |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n【86】Step 3: Prevention and Management of Adverse Effects\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【87】There are important opiate-induced adverse effects to anticipate, prevent, and educate patients and families about. Some are predictable and expected such as constipation, fuzzy-headedness, and mild nausea. Most patients with pain will need a stool stimulant or softener; however, for hospice patients, there is no advantage to using a stool softener.\n\n【88】If opioid induced, constipation refractory to an aggressive bowel regimen can also be managed with the use of methylnaltrexone, a modification of naltrexone that does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore will not reverse analgesia. In the most recent placebo-controlled trial, 63% of patients achieved a bowel movement with use of methylnaltrexone compared with just 9% in those receiving placebo.\n\n【89】The primary adverse effect of methylnaltrexone is the expense.\n\n【90】The management of nausea and vomiting associated with opioid use is based on practical experience and nonrandomized trials. The available evidence suggests that dopamine antagonists such as prochlorperazine or metoclopramide may be the most effective, available, and inexpensive; serotonin-blocking ondansetron can be effective but is much more expensive and can be constipating.\n\n【91】Unresolved Clinical Questions and Future Directions\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【92】The biggest unresolved issue in pain management is neuropathic pain because of relatively ineffective drugs, some placebo response, publication bias, and no major “winners.”\n\n【93】Pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\n【94】Long after the stimulus is gone, the nerve is still sending a danger signal that can be disabling.\n\n【95】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【96】Pilot evaluation of Scrambler therapy for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【97】and 95% pain relief in postherpetic neuralgia, failed back syndrome, and spinal cord stenosis\n\n【98】with no toxicity.

The primary barriers for effective pain management include (1) inadequate pain assessment and management training (lack of awareness of one's own knowledge deficits), (2) failure to refer patients to pain management specialists, (3) patient reluctance and poor adherence (not covered in this review), and (4) poor reimbursement for nonprocedural pain management (not covered in this review). These barriers are in addition to the complexities of pain itself.\n\n【108】Specific actions that providers can take are to always do a thorough pain assessment, learn to use both opioids and adjunctive medications, tailor neuropathic pain treatments to the cause of the pain, and refer patients to pain specialists earlier and more often.", "index": -1, "show": true, "start": -1, "end": 1551, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余标点"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【64】), concerns about "}], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:09:47", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:13:21", "cost": 213.993}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:33", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:13:21", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:09:47"}

Participants were recruited before the class start date. Those who consented received a preclass survey and another survey 6 weeks after the class started to obtain data on demographic characteristics, baseline joint problems or pain, injuries in the preceding 6 weeks, class satisfaction, and exercise habits. Classes lasted 6 weeks and were led by a trainer for 60 minutes, once weekly. Participants were encouraged to perform similar exercise on 2 additional nonconsecutive days throughout the week. _Injury_ was self-reported and defined as experiencing new pain or sustaining injury while exercising during the 6-week time frame. The primary outcome measure was the number of injuries per 1000 training hours.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The injury rate was 9.0 injuries per 1000 training hours (95% CI, 5.8-13.4 injuries per 1000 training hours) during the 6-week training and 5.0 injuries per 1000 training hours (95% CI, 2.8-8.2 injuries per 1000 training hours) during the 6 weeks preceding enrollment ( _P_ \\=.08). Injury occurred in 18 (18%) of participants during the 6-week training, and 9 of 24 injuries (37.5%) occurred during a training class. The most commonly injured regions were knees (n=7) and back (n=6). Burpees and squats were the most common movements causing injury.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The increased injury rate during the study was not statistically significant.

The vast majority of pain can be readily managed if simple principles of practice are followed. Chronic pain requires continuous analgesia, and severe pain requires use of strong analgesics, most commonly the opioids. In addition to drugs administered continually, short-acting medications must be available for “breakthrough” pain. This article reviews the principles of pain management in terminally ill patients, using a case-based demonstration.\n\n【1】Pain is a common symptom in patients nearing the end of life. Studies report that 15% to 77% of patients have unrelieved, pronounced pain during the last year of life.\n\n【2】Fortunately, most pain can be diminished substantially with appropriate use of analgesic medications.\n\n【3】删除21:<u>Management of Cancer Pain: Clinical Practice Guideline—No. 9.

This review focuses on a case of severe pain and its management through the final stages of a patient's life.\n\n【7】Illustrative Case\n-----------------\n\n【8】_Mr C is a 54-year-old man who presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain of several days' duration. Computed tomography of the abdomen reveals a 5-cm mass in the head of the pancreas and the presence of hepatic metastases. The patient is in severe pain (rated a score of 9 on a scale of 0 to 10 in which 10 is the worst pain imaginable)_  _and has been taking only over-the-counter analgesics, which are not relieving his pain._\n\n【9】Initiation of Analgesia\n-----------------------\n\n【10】Although there is no tissue confirmation, there is a strong suspicion that this patient has metastatic pancreatic cancer, an ultimately terminal disease. Regardless of the diagnosis, he is in severe pain and requires strong medication for relief. Analgesia should not be delayed while the evaluation is being pursued. Immediate management calls for use of a strong opioid. Although many strong opioids are available, morphine is the prototypic drug, and no other drug is more effective for pain relief. A typical initial dose for an opioid-naive man in severe pain (score of 8) is 1 to 5 mg given as an intravenous bolus. The time to peak effect of an intravenous bolus dose of morphine is 6 to 15 minutes. The time to peak effect is crucial for proper dosing and analgesic control. It is essential to wait at least until the peak effect has been achieved before determining the effectiveness of the last administered dose. If the patient remains in severe pain, doses should be repeated at that same interval until relief is obtained. Using pain scores (selecting a pain scale appropriate for each patient) is an effective guide . The pain score should be evaluated at the time of presentation and after each intervention during titration of analgesic medications. It should also be monitored routinely in all patients as part of assessing vital signs.\n\n【11】Table 1 Scales to Evaluate Pain\n\n| Scale | Description | Use |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Verbal numerical rating | On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, rate your current pain level | Most adults respond well, elderly adults may not respond as well, young children or those in whom a language barrier exists do better with other scales |\n| Visual linear analogue | Line with 0 to 10, may be numerical or colored, ranging from blue (no pain) to red (maximal pain) | Good for elderly adults, patients in whom a language barrier exists; use with caution in those who are color blind |\n| Faces5Wong DLWhaley LFClinical Handbook of Pediatric Nursing. 2nd ed. Mosby , St Louis, Mo 1986Google Scholar | Series of pictures of faces, from smiling to severe frown with tears | Best for children or those in whom a language barrier exists |\n\n【13】_Mr C is given 4 mg of morphine sulfate as an intravenous bolus. Fifteen minutes later, he notes that his pain level has decreased substantially, but he rates it a 6. A second dose of 4 mg of morphine is administered, and 15 minutes later he rates his pain a 4 and reports that he is more comfortable. After an hour, the patient rates his pain a 4 and is pleased with the progress being made in controlling his pain._\n\n【14】### Dosing\n\n【15】Rapid titration of analgesia to relieve pain is possible by using frequent dosing at appropriate intervals determined by time to peak effect. In patients whose pain is likely to persist, a continual supply of drug is necessary to maintain analgesia; however, the required opioid doses must first be determined. The patient should continue to receive doses as needed until the pain is relatively well controlled and a steady state is reached; typically, this takes 12 to 24 hours of dosing. The easiest way to provide this is with a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump .\n\n【16】Table 2 Patient-Controlled Analgesia Pump\n\n| Analgesic drug | Name of drug and concentration in milligram/milliliter | Morphine sulfate, 1 mg/mL |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Loading dose | Initial dose to be given only once | 4-mg intravenous loading dose 1 time only |\n| Intermittent patientcontrolled dose | Dose patient is able to self-administer as needed | 2 mg of intravenous morphine |\n| Lockout interval | Minutes between doses, should be based on time to peak effect of drug | Lockout interval 10 min (typically should be 6–15 min) |\n| Basal rate | Amount of drug to be infused continuously; do not begin infusion until opioid requirements are known | 3 mg of morphine per hour in a continuous infusion |\n| 4-h limit | Maximum dose patient may receive in any 4-h interval, regardless of how often button is pushed | 4-h lockout is 36 mg |\n| Pain rating | Monitor every 15–30 min when treating severe, acute pain; after severe pain controlled, moniter every 2–4 h | Record pain score every 15 min; notify physician if pain score >6 (on a scale of 0–10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the greatest pain imaginable) |\n| Monitoring of adverse effects | Especially respiratory rate and sensorium | Monitor respiratory rate every 1 h; if <10/min, notify physician |\n| Other | Patient should be the only one allowed to administer the drug; if sedation occurs, patient will be unable to administer more doses, preventing oversedation | Family members and nurses are not allowed to administer drug |\n\n【18】_A PCA pump is used with a bolus dose of 4 mg, at a lockout interval of 15 minutes. No basal rate is given until the opioid requirement is known. A 4-hour limit on the total amount of drug delivered may be set._\n\n【19】Physicians are often reluctant to use strong opioids to treat pain because of a fear of oversedation or causing respiratory depression. One of the main advantages to using a PCA pump is that, if the patient becomes sedated, he or she is unable to press the button to receive more drug. Thus, it is critical to instruct family members and nurses to not administer doses.\n\n【20】_Mr C continues using his PCA pump, receiving doses of 4 mg every 15 minutes as needed. After 12 hours, he has received 6 additional bolus doses. He currently rates his pain a 2 or 3 and is satisfied with the pain relief. The morphine regimen used is as follows: 8 mg in the first hour, 6 doses at 4 mg each equals 24 mg in 11 hours; total morphine used in the past 12 hours is 32 mg._\n\n【21】When treating pain that is expected to continue, the physician must provide for continuous analgesia based on each individual's opioid requirements to achieve pain control. Once adequate analgesia is attained, the total number of milligrams of opioid given over the preceding interval, excluding initial loading doses (these are determined by the volume of distribution, not the steady-state pharmacokinetics), should be used to determine the patient's continuous infusion rate. Of importance, the physician must remember to readjust the breakthrough dose schedule and the lockout rate.\n\n【22】Even though continuous analgesia is required, it is imperative to provide for breakthrough pain. No firm guidelines exist for the exact dose of opioid needed for breakthrough pain, although many investigators\n\n【23】recommend using 10% to 15% of the total daily dose. This dose should be administered at a frequency determined by the time to peak effect for the drug and route. For intravenous administration, the time to peak effect is about 15 minutes. For oral administration of immediate-release morphine, the time to peak effect is 1 hour. Such titration of the dose is safe, especially in patients with pain or those who have previously been taking opioids.\n\n【24】_The 24 mg of morphine used during the past 11 hours equals 2.2 mg/h of continuous infusion. The asneeded bolus dose is adjusted to 2.2 mg/h for 24 h × 0.10, equaling 5.2 mg. The prescription is a 5-mg bolus dose every 15 minutes as needed._ _Eight hours after admission, Mr C is somnolent but arousable. He reports a pain score of 0. His vital signs are unremarkable, and his pupils, although constricted, are reactive. The physician believes the patient is somewhat narcotized. His dose of opioids is reduced by 50% but still continued. The new infusion rate is now 1 mg/h, and the new bolus rate is 2 mg every 15 minutes as needed._\n\n【25】### Follow-up\n\n【26】Careful follow-up and frequent reassessment of the patient are the most important aspects of analgesic management. At times, administration of opioids may be excessive, even when administered by an expert. This does not mean that these medications are unsafe; they are safe as long as the patient is monitored appropriately. Among the greatest challenges faced by clinicians in this setting is trying to determine whether the patient's somnolence is due to excessive analgesic doses or to drowsiness because this is the first substantial pain-free interval the patient has experienced since development of his or her illness. Pain creates sleep deprivation, and if analgesia is obtained, one of the first natural responses in a sleep-deprived individual is to sleep. If vital signs are stable, the patient is easily arousable, and the respiratory rate is sufficient, a dose reduction, or even continuation of the same dose and continued close observation, is appropriate. The use of naloxone in patients with a severe underlying pain source should almost always be avoided. In rare instances when immediate reversal of opioid overdosing is thought to be necessary because of respiratory depression, naloxone can be administered judiciously after 50% dilution. The patient should be monitored closely, and the least amount of naloxone needed to reverse the respiratory depression should be used. Of note, the half-life of naloxone is short, and repeated doses may be necessary. The opioid infusion should be discontinued until respiratory depression is reversed, then resumed at a lower dose (eg, a 50% reduction).\n\n【27】This patient's pain is now controlled, and the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of his metastatic pancreatic cancer have been addressed. He is preparing to be discharged to his home. Although portable PCA infusion pumps are available, oral therapy is more convenient and less expensive. Conversion to oral therapy should be based on the amount of narcotic required to control his pain in the preceding 24 hours.\n\n【28】_Mr C's average pain score over the previous 24 hours is rated a 1 or 2. During the past 24 hours, his regimen has been as follows: 1 mg/h for 24 hours equals 24 mg, 5 bolus doses at 2 mg/bolus equals 10 mg, and total morphine administered intravenously in the past 24 hours is 34 mg. Dose conversion from intravenous to oral therapy is 1:3; therefore, 100 mg of oral morphine per day is required. A regimen of 30 mg of continuous-release morphine every 8 hours is initiated. (Continuous-release morphine is available in 15-, 30-, 60-, and 100-mg tablets.) Breakthrough medication is also supplied with use of immediate-release morphine: 100 mg/d × 0.10 equals 10 mg of immediate-release oral morphine every 1 hour as needed. The time to peak effect for oral immediate-release morphine is 1 hour._\n\n【29】Conversion to Oral Therapy\n--------------------------\n\n【30】When converting from intravenous to oral morphine, the intravenous morphine must be discontinued at some time. Given the kinetics of the sustained-release preparations of opioids, it typically takes 4 to 6 hours to achieve adequate blood levels and up to 3 half-lives to achieve steady-state levels. The current recommendation is to stop the continuous intravenous infusion approximately 4 to 6 hours after the first oral dose of continuous-release medication, keeping the as-needed bolus doses available for coverage.\n\n【31】_Three weeks later, Mr C presents with persistent nausea and vomiting. Evaluation reveals a fixed small-bowel obstruction secondary to tumor progression. His pain had been controlled with 150 mg of morphine per day. Because he is no longer able to tolerate oral medications, a new route of administration is required._\n\n【32】Routes of Drug Administration\n-----------------------------\n\n【33】Fortunately, multiple routes of administration are available for opioids, including oral, rectal, transdermal, intravenous, subcutaneous, epidural, intrathecal, and intramuscular. Because of erratic absorption and pain, the intramuscular route is generally discouraged. The epidural or intrathecal route requires placement of a catheter, and, although this approach can be effective for pain management, catheters are typically used only in special circumstances. Intravenous opioid administration works well but can be cumbersome for a patient to use at home and requires continuous intravenous access, pumps, and equipment. The subcutaneous route is somewhat more convenient; a 25-gauge butterfly needle is placed under the skin. The needle should be changed every 3 days, but the procedure is relatively simple. However, caution should be used in patients who become dehydrated because this may hamper systemic absorption and decrease analgesic efficacy. Rectal administration is often uncomfortable for the caregiver and the patient but can be effective; both immediate-release and sustainedrelease preparations can be used.\n\n【34】However, the duration of action may be shortened with rectal administration.\n\n【35】The transdermal route of opioid delivery is often the simplest and most convenient for patients who are unable to take oral medications. Fentanyl patches are the preferred choice for transdermal administration. They are labeled on the basis of the administered dose they provide, in terms of micrograms per hour. The dose conversion from oral morphine to transdermal fentanyl is as follows: 1 mg/h equals 2 mg/d of oral morphine.\n\n【36】When switching from one opioid to another, most experts recommend a 20% to 25% decrease in the dose of the new opioid because of incomplete cross-tolerance.\n\n【37】_Mr C's pain has been well controlled with 150 mg of oral morphine per day; conversion to transdermal fentanyl is as follows: 150 mg/d of oral morphine × 1 μg/h of fentanyl divided by 2 mg of oral morphine per day equals 75 μg in a fentanyl patch; this dose should then be reduced by 25% for incomplete cross-tolerance. A 75-μg/h patch × 0.75 equals 56 μg/h. Therefore, a 50-μg patch is ordered with plans to change it every 72 hours._\n\n【38】Treatment of Breakthrough Pain\n------------------------------\n\n【39】The strategy for treatment of breakthrough pain should be determined. Because the patient is having difficulty taking oral medication, the parenteral routes, intravenous and subcutaneous, can be used. However, a more convenient approach is to use an oral high-concentration morphine solution such as Roxanal, which contains 20 mg of morphine per milliliter. One or 2 milliliters of the solution can be placed between the patient's cheek and gum. A rapid “burst” is absorbed by the buccal mucosa, with the rest being swallowed and absorbed slowly through the gastrointestinal tract. Such small volumes are often well tolerated.\n\n【40】Another choice is to use an oral fentanyl lozenge. This should be placed in the patient's mouth until pain relief is obtained, and then it should be removed. Fentanyl is rapidly absorbed with this method and can be effective. Care must be taken to not allow the patient to fall asleep with the lozenge in the mouth. These lozenges must be kept out of the reach of small children, who may mistake them for lollipops.\n\n【41】Several caveats regarding the use of transdermal fentanyl must be remembered. Absorption is highly temperature dependent, and fever can increase the rate of absorption and alter the kinetics of the drug. This can lead to high serum levels and adverse effects such as sedation or respiratory depression. In addition, the patch may not be effective for the entire 72 hours, and pain may occur sooner; thus, patches may need to be changed more frequently. Furthermore, the patch depends on subcutaneous fat and hydration status for absorption; thus, in cachectic or severely dehydrated patients, other analgesics are likely better choices.\n\n【42】_Over the course of time, Mr C's disease has progressed, and his pain is becoming increasingly difficult to control. Because of this, a celiac plexus block is performed. Pain control is excellent. The same doses of analgesia have been continued after the block. During the next 48 hours, he becomes somnolent and develops respiratory depression._\n\n【43】Reassessment of Opioid Dose\n---------------------------\n\n【44】The patient's opioid requirements have decreased because of the nerve block. Therefore, his pain has decreased considerably, and his opioid requirements have decreased. The previous doses of opioids that he had tolerated now represent excessive doses, and adverse effects emerge. When a procedure is performed that may diminish the source of pain, the opioid requirements must be reassessed and readjusted.\n\n【45】_Mr C's opioid dose is decreased by half and re-titrated to a level that produces pain control without excessive adverse effects. Three weeks later, Mr C presents with recurrent abdominal pain. Additional history reveals that he has had no bowel movement in the past 3 weeks. An x-ray film of the abdomen shows a large amount of stool in the colon. Treatment with enemas and laxatives resolves the constipation and the pain._\n\n【46】Bowel Management\n----------------\n\n【47】When use of narcotics is initiated in a patient, regardless of the route used, a bowel regimen should be initiated. Constipation is almost universal in patients taking opioids; prevention is more effective than treatment. A thorough history and physical examination should always be the cornerstone of the evaluation of any patient with pain. When pain recurs or is exacerbated, treatment and evaluation should be based on a thorough history and physical examination, and other potential confounding problems should be considered. It would have been easy to assume that this patient's worsening pain was due to advancing disease, for which he would have been treated with increased doses of opioid. However, he needed enemas and laxatives to relieve his pain .\n\n【48】Table 3 Types of Drugs to Treat Constipation\n\n| Class and drug | Oral dose |\n| --- | --- |\n| Stool softener |  |\n| Ducosate sodium | 50–500 mg twice daily |\n| Stimulant laxative |  |\n| Senna | 187-mg tablet, up to 2 tablets per day |\n| Bisacodyl | 5-mg tablet, up to 30 mg/d |\n| Cascara | 325 mg every day |\n| Saline laxative |  |\n| Magnesium hydroxide | 15–30 mg |\n| Magnesium citrate | 240 mL |\n| Hyperosmolar agent |  |\n| Lactulose | 15–30 mL, up to 3 times daily |\n| Sorbitol 70% solution | 15–30 mL, up to 3 times daily |\n\n【50】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【51】Dying does not need to be painful.

Whereas 4 vaccines are approved in the United States and masks are widely available, too few are fully immunized and most of the population has stopped wearing protective masks. The ongoing consequences of this include continued excess morbidity and mortality and the generation of immune-evading variants and subvariants, which _in toto_ are injurious and ultimately self-defeating. Herein we briefly update and review COVID-19 vaccines, waning immunity, and new variants.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ), COVID-19 ( coronavirus disease 2019 ), RBD ( receptor-binding domain ), SARS-CoV-2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ), TTS ( thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome ), VOC ( variant of concern )\n\n【4】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus with a rapidly changing and highly mutable genotype. The available data are highly kinetic and dynamic, occurring in an environment of uncertainty but with periodic yet repeated surge-related morbidity and mortality coupled with and often driven by distorted human behavior.\n\n【5】The reality is that much of what we think we know about SARS-CoV-2 is likely wrong, outdated, tinged with false presuppositions, and often based on belief-dependent realism and tribalistic thinking. Instead, the best way of knowing truth for a scientific issue is the scientific method, although that can often be incompatible with what the public wants to believe.\n\n【6】Everything we understand thus far about SARS-CoV-2 is conditional on time, variant, geography, type of host immunity, host factors and behavior, population structure, and levels of immunity at the macro and micro levels; community burden of transmission; and the interplay among these. The story of this pandemic, when it is written, is going to be seen as highly dependent on and perturbed by both human and viral behavior. We only get to influence the first factor (human behavior), although it obviously influences the second (viral behavior). Therefore, we will continue to see the evolution of viral variants—some of which have developed, are developing, and will continue to develop the ability to evade, in whole or in part, both vaccine-induced and illness-induced immunity as well as prevention and treatment with antivirals and monoclonal antibodies.\n\n【7】**Harsh Truths**\n\n【8】The unfortunate and harsh truth about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States is that more than a million COVID-19 deaths have occurred as of this writing. There have been 225,000 confirmed COVID deaths in the United States thus far in 2022 alone, despite the widespread availability of safe and effective vaccines. One of every 303 Americans is now dead of COVID-19, with a continuing toll currently of 300 to 400 deaths per day. We have had more deaths nationwide than deaths due to the 1918 US influenza pandemic. A major reason for this is that currently only 68% of Americans are fully vaccinated and only 33% are boosted. Less than 10% of eligible Americans have received the newer updated bivalent booster.\n\n【9】If we examine the data from other developed countries with the ability to accurately track vaccine uptake, the United States has among the lowest percentage of the population that has received a booster dose, and therefore it is no surprise that we had more cumulative deaths per capita during the Omicron wave than any of these other countries. In fact, the United States has had the highest death rate of any of 21 other high-income countries.\n\n【10】Although it is unthinkable that this could be the case, we must accept that the data are the data. Globally, the World Health Organization has estimated that approximately 15 million people have died of COVID-19.\n\n【11】Brutal Realities of COVID-19 in the United States\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】An examination of the current average daily new COVID-19 cases reveals that the unvaccinated have about 3 times the rate of acquiring new cases compared with the fully vaccinated in addition to a 6-fold higher risk of death. Whereas death rates have fallen as of May 2022, case rates soared to more than 100,000 new cases in the United States per day through the spring and summer of 2022, and this is likely to be a vast underestimate because of extensive home testing that is never reported. Yet, consistent with belief-dependent realism, no amount of data has swayed vaccine-hesitant and vaccine-rejecting individuals.\n\n【13】Multiple distorting human factors have an impact on the ability to manage the pandemic, from individual and collective human behavior patterns to a false epistemology by which the public attempts to understand and manage the pandemic. Human behavior during the pandemic has included vaccine hesitancy and rejection; rejection of masks; political and economic conflicts of interest; lack of leadership; and the discovery of animal reservoirs, such as the white-tailed deer and mink, that have been infected by human activity. In addition, we are dealing with pathologic cultural narcissism (a “me” not “we” mentality) and the false presupposition of the democratization of expertise. These factors are and have been injurious, self-defeating, and self-destructive. Ultimately, and indicative of massive issues that will occur into the future, we have lost any collective transcendent reference points by which we make decisions and act for one another’s and society’s interest.\n\n【14】### SARS-CoV-2 Variants and the Lies We Tell Ourselves\n\n【15】The spike protein projecting from SARS-CoV-2 is composed of a number of parts, primarily the S2 and S1 domains, and contained within the S1 or distal part of the spike protein is the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The RBD binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, allowing the virus to enter the cell and to hijack host cellular machinery to manufacture massive numbers of viral progeny.\n\n【16】If we examine the number and location of mutations in 3 SARS-CoV-2 variants (wild type, Delta, and Omicron), one is struck by the significantly enhanced numbers of mutations from the original Wuhan ancestral strain to the Omicron variant. Not surprisingly, many of those mutations have accumulated in the RBD. As a result, as these types of variants arise, we begin to lose some level of effectiveness from illness-induced and vaccine-induced immunity as well as the efficacy of specific monoclonal antibodies as the virus mutates to evade immunity. The pattern of viral mutations often exactly matches the binding site between viral RBD and monoclonal antibody binding, accounting for loss of neutralizing activity.\n\n【17】Since December 2021, the predominant circulating variant in the United States has been the Omicron variant. Importantly, this was completely unpredictable as the expectation was that Delta subvariants would be next to arise. The Omicron variant was isolated in Botswana in November 2021 and then rapidly spread throughout South Africa and the rest of the world. Even though we have previously observed this type of pattern globally, if we go back to that early December 2021 time frame, most of the world believed Omicron would not be a problem. Omicron subsequently became widely geographically dispersed. It is significantly more transmissible than Delta but fortunately seems to have somewhat lower virulence compared with Delta, probably because of its propensity for upper rather than lower airway infection, and some level of population immunity. Omicron demonstrated a larger genetic distance than any other variant of concern (VOC) from the ancestral strain\n\n【18】mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine boosters induce neutralizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.\n\n【19】and is better able to escape illness and vaccine-induced immunity compared with other VOCs as well as to evade the therapeutic effect of monoclonal antibodies. One consequence of this enhanced transmissibility is the significantly enhanced infection rate of children vs the other VOCs.\n\n【20】### BA.2—“Stealth” Omicron\n\n【21】Although we again heard that it would not be an important public health issue, BA.2, the “stealth” Omicron, represented most new cases globally by April 2022. For example, the incidence in the Republic of South Africa went from about 22% of sequenced viruses to 86% between February 4 and February 11, 2022, and BA.2 subsequently outcompeted Omicron globally. It is approximately 30% more transmissible than Omicron. There is evidence of increased virulence and immune evasion capability with reduced efficacy of sotrovimab and a requirement for double the dose of tixagevimab-cilgavimab as prophylaxis. Since May, the United States and Europe have experienced yet another wave of COVID-19, this time due to Omicron subvariants—BA 2.12, BA 2.12.1, and BA 4/5. Currently, a variant under monitoring is the BA 2.75.2 subvariant, which may further evade illness and vaccine-induced immunity as well as all monoclonal antibodies except bebtelovimab. More worrisome has been the rapid evolution and spread of additional Omicron subvariants, including BA.5 variants (BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BF.7, BQ.X, XBB, BJ.1, other), BA.2 variants (BA.2.75.2, BS.1), BA.4 variants (BA.4.6), and others. Several of these arising variants may very well evade, in whole or in part, vaccine- and illness-induced immunity as well as monoclonal antibodies.\n\n【22】### What Should We Be Most Concerned With—Transmissibility or Virulence?\n\n【23】In addition to viral virulence, we must also be concerned with viral transmissibility. As an example, let us take a baseline community that has a steady 10,000 infections. Let us assume that each new case generates an average of 1.1 new cases and that around 0.8% of new cases result in death. In 1 month’s time, approximately 129 deaths would be expected. However, what happens if the virus is 50% more lethal, like Delta? The number of deaths would jump to nearly 200 in 1 month. Instead of changing lethality, what if we instead make the virus 50% more contagious, like Omicron? Now, after a month, there are 978 deaths—or a 658% increase!\n\n【24】That is what causes exponential spread. Human decision makers cannot deal, in a timely manner, with exponentiality. They always get it wrong, hence the astounding and continuing levels of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.\n\n【25】Another way to think about exponentiality is by taking 2 scenarios, assuming 10 cycles of transmission in a naive population, where we vary R <sub>0 </sub> , which is the basic reproductive rate of the virus—a measure of how many people, on average, an infected person would subsequently infect\n\n【26】:\n\n【27】*   •\n\n【28】    Scenario A with R <sub>0 </sub> \\= 2.5: leads to 9536 infections\n\n【29】*   •\n\n【30】    Scenario B with R <sub>0 </sub> \\= 6: leads to 60,466,176 infections\n\n【31】This important principle of exponentiality is what allowed us to predict that Omicron would lead to a worse surge and more deaths compared with Delta, which was counterintuitive to many decision makers. In fact, compared with the 2021 winter peak, Omicron cases rose 300%; hospitalizations, 115%; and deaths, 59%. Worse, the newer Omicron subvariants demonstrate R <sub>0 </sub> values closer to 12, accounting for the significant surge in new cases in the United States.\n\n【32】COVID-19 Vaccine—Efficacy and Effectiveness\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【33】When it comes to vaccine efficacy, there is a complex interplay between host characteristics, pathogen characteristics, vaccine type, time since vaccination, and geography. Host characteristics include demographic differences, genetic factors, existing immunity, and comorbidities. Virus characteristics include the specific variant, inoculum size, and portal of entry.\n\n【34】### What Is Vaccine Efficacy?\n\n【35】Vaccine efficacy can be viewed as a gradient of protection. Like virtually all our vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are far better at blocking _disease_ vs blocking _infection_ . If we look at prevention of death, the mRNA vaccines were reported as 95% efficacious (against the Alpha variant); but if we look at asymptomatic infection and transmission, depending on the amount of time lapsed since last dose, it could be 0% to 40%. Vaccine efficacy depends on multiple factors, such as the underlying immune system health (innate, adaptive humoral, adaptive cellular) in the host, preexisting immunity, predominant circulating variant, community burden of transmission, and genetic factors. Overall, for the population, we can consider that there are 3 “enemies” to the development of immunity after vaccination: age, variant, and time.\n\n【36】With age comes immunosenescence and decreased vaccine immunogenicity along with a growing number of medical comorbidities. In general, if we look at people who were immunized in their 20s to 40s, they develop an abundant antibody response. On the other hand, people immunized in their 60s to 80s with the same vaccine under the same conditions develop a much lower level of antibodies. So, with age, we generally become more susceptible to infection and develop less robust immune responses to vaccines, a condition known as immunosenescence.\n\n【37】Age-dependent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and P.1 variant by vaccine immune serum samples.\n\n【38】With new variants have come mutations and recombination events resulting in immune evasion and the decreased ability of neutralizing antibody to bind virus and to block attachment to cell receptors. We see a similar trend in looking at the effect of VOC plus age. For example, if we measure neutralization of both the WA1/2020 strain and P1 variant, we find that not only does neutralizing ability wane with time, but at any one time point there is a difference (decrease) in the amount of measurable neutralizing antibodies by increasing age.\n\n【39】Age-dependent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and P.1 variant by vaccine immune serum samples.\n\n【40】In 1 study, there was a measurable and highly significant 22-fold drop in neutralization of the Omicron variant by Pfizer vaccine–elicited immunity.\n\n【41】Omicron extensively but incompletely escapes Pfizer BNT162b2 neutralization.\n\n【42】So logically, even vaccinated individuals are going to become more susceptible to infection in a shorter time due to Omicron and Omicron subvariants circulating, and of course, this is exactly what has happened.\n\n【43】If we look at the first 3 approved vaccines in the United States and track the hazard ratio for becoming polymerase chain reaction positive (ie, infected) after adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, sex, and comorbidities, Janssen wanes the fastest, followed by Pfizer, followed by Moderna, the last being most likely a dose effect.\n\n【44】Thus, with increasing time, antibody levels and therefore protection do decrease. Vaccine effectiveness for infection over time also differs among the 3 vaccines. During a 6-month period, effectiveness against infection for adults in the United States wanes from about 89% to 58% with Moderna, from 87% to 43% with Pfizer, and from 86% to 13% with Janssen.\n\n【45】Effectiveness against death and severe disease, however, is relatively well maintained, which reflects the gradient of protection previously discussed. This likely reflects the fact that prevention of disease tends to be more T-cell mediated, whereas prevention of infection is B-cell mediated.\n\n【46】Effectiveness of mRNA BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine up to 6 months in a large integrated health system in the USA: a retrospective cohort study.\n\n【47】Unfortunately, we do not have a suitable standardized method for routine measurement of cellular immune responses to vaccination for clinical use. Newer data on Pfizer vaccine effectiveness showed the same trend.\n\n【48】删除21:<u>Effectiveness of COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in preventing COVID-19–associated emergency department and urgent care encounters and hospitalizations among nonimmunocompromised children and adolescents aged 5-17 years—VISION Network, 10 states, April 2021–January 2022.</u>\n\n【49】During an Omicron-predominant time period, effectiveness in healthy 12- to 15-year-olds against emergency department/urgent care visits after 2 vaccine doses (14 to 149 days earlier) was 45%, with no measurable efficacy after 150 days. We see the same phenomenon if we look at the same data for healthy 16- to 17-year-olds, but if they received 3 doses, vaccine effectiveness was boosted back up to 81%. Regardless, in both age groups, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was relatively maintained at very high levels even after 150 days.\n\n【50】### Why Do Breakthrough Cases Occur?\n\n【51】Breakthrough cases are the predictable and expected result of a collision of waning immunity, new variants with immune-evading capability, high community burden of transmission, and inherent host factors as discussed here.\n\n【52】#### Booster Doses and the Wobble Stage\n\n【53】There is a theoretical construct vaccinologists use when thinking about delivering vaccines to a population in the context of an emerging pathogen for which there is no prior immunity. The main principles of this construct include the following:\n\n【54】*   •\n\n【55】    Building population-level immunity quickly. Unfortunately, we were not successful in doing that because of vaccine hesitancy and rejection.\n\n【56】*   •\n\n【57】    Rebuilding immunity as it wanes with time. Boosters are required, but even they will wane with time, and far fewer people received timely boosters.\n\n【58】*   •\n\n【59】    Eventually, as in the case of SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/5 and subvariants, a new variant develops that requires refocusing immunity to that viral variant with a variant-focused vaccine booster. This is the wobble stage that we are in right now.\n\n【60】#### Real-World Effectiveness Data\n\n【61】Individuals who received the primary Pfizer series and then were boosted barely accumulate any measurable risks of hospitalization, whereas those who received only 2 doses suffer from more hospitalizations. This is true for both severe disease and death.\n\n【62】Effectiveness of a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for preventing severe outcomes in Israel: an observational study.\n\n【63】If we analyze homologous vs heterologous boosting, after the administration of 2 doses of Pfizer vaccine, there is waning of vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant but much faster and significant waning of vaccine effectiveness against variants like Omicron. When we add a Pfizer booster dose, we get a profound boost in vaccine effectiveness that begins to wane quickly. On the other hand, when the booster dose is Moderna (heterologous boosting), effectiveness seems to be better. Thus, a “mix and match” strategy may offer some slight benefit.\n\n【64】Pfizer vaccine data in the elderly reveal a similar story.\n\n【65】Durability of omicron-neutralising serum activity after mRNA booster immunisation in older adults.\n\n【66】Measurable neutralizing ability was somewhat depressed for the Delta strain vs the Wuhan strain but profoundly depressed for Omicron. The neutralizing ability improves with boosting but wanes again and is more suppressed with Omicron compared with Delta and Wuhan. Moderna vaccine was also effective against infection after the second dose with waning over time, especially against Omicron. When boosted, effectiveness improves, but similarly more waning of immunity was observed with Omicron than with Delta.\n\n【67】Effectiveness of mRNA-1273 against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta variants.\n\n【68】There seems to be consistency across the vaccines, with slightly better neutralization capability of Moderna vs Pfizer. The major point is that allowing continued viral transmission in the population will continue to result in the development of variants that will “learn” how to evade immunity by means of mutation and recombination.\n\n【69】#### Vaccine Effectiveness Against Hospitalizations\n\n【70】During the Omicron-predominant period through January 2021, after 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine, effectiveness against infection fell dramatically after 5 months to the 50% range. However, with a third dose (booster dose 1), it goes back up into the 90% range but subsequently falls into the 80% range and continues to gradually wane with time. Thus, booster doses are critical in providing the maximum amount of protection against infection, hospitalization, severe disease, and death.\n\n【71】删除21:<u>Waning 2-dose and 3-dose effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19–associated emergency department and urgent care encounters and hospitalizations among adults during periods of Delta and Omicron variant predominance—VISION Network, 10 states, August 2021–January 2022.</u>\n\n【72】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【73】### Vaccine Recommendations\n\n【74】As a result of the preceding, we have seen the evolution of recommendations for vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now allow that the second dose can be delayed up to 8 weeks after the first dose for those who are otherwise healthy and who are older than 12 years and younger than 65 years. The reason is that the longer the interval between doses, the better the immunogenicity and durability with reduced adverse effects. In fact, there is early evidence that we can decrease the already small risk of myocarditis by expanding that interval. The issue is that until 2 doses have been received, protection against disease is compromised. As for the Janssen vaccine, the most recent recommendation is to subsequently boost with an mRNA vaccine. In the immunocompromised host, 2 doses are given, with a later additional dose (third dose) followed by a booster dose (fourth dose) 2 or more months after the third dose. For nonimmunocompromised persons, a newer bivalent mRNA booster is available, as is a protein subunit vaccine for use as a booster 2 or more months after the last vaccine dose. These recommendations will continue to evolve as more data become available and with the advent of new boosters and new variants that threaten health, and the CDC vaccine guidance charts should be consulted.\n\n【75】### Vaccine Safety\n\n【76】It is important to communicate that there is no such thing as “safe” with any human-made product. There is only the balance between risk and benefit and therefore the concept of “safer.” Wisdom, then, resides in guiding patients in which risks to undertake for the most benefit as there is no risk-free pathway. There are only 4 choices: COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, passive immunity, and absolute isolation. As the Janssen vaccine is no longer a preferred vaccine, here we primarily comment on the issue of myocarditis.\n\n【77】#### Myocarditis/Myopericarditis\n\n【78】The predominant risk discussed in the media due to COVID-19 vaccination is myopericarditis. There is relatively little risk of myocarditis/myopericarditis after the first dose regardless of which mRNA vaccine is administered. The second dose appears to be the issue, hence the recommendation of increasing the time interval between doses. There appears to be a greater risk with Moderna vaccine (probably because of dose) compared with Pfizer vaccine.\n\n【79】SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and myocarditis or myopericarditis: population based cohort study.\n\n【80】If we look at a 7-day risk interval per million doses given, we find that this is a male-predominant adverse effect that happens significantly less often in female patients. It is more common during the pubertal period but can still happen in older individuals but with much less frequency.\n\n【81】删除21:<u>Myocarditis cases reported after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination in the US from December 2020 to August 2021.</u>\n\n【82】Examining risks vs benefits reveals that if we administer 1 million doses of an mRNA vaccine to men aged 16 to 17 years, we prevent about 57,000 cases of COVID-19, 500 COVID-19–related hospitalizations, and 170 COVID-19–related intensive care unit admissions. The price we pay is 73 cases of vaccine-associated myocarditis.\n\n【83】If we examine the number of excess events due to vaccine exposure per million exposed, we find a significantly smaller number for myocarditis in those who received a dose or 2 doses of mRNA vaccines compared with myocarditis in those who became COVID-19 infected. When we look at pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias, it is almost always related to the infection.\n\n【84】Risks of myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias associated with COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【85】As another example, the risk of myocarditis in patients with COVID-19 is about 16 times higher vs that in noninfected people. The myocarditis risk is 37 times higher for infected children younger than 16 years and 7 times higher for infected people aged 16 to 39 years compared with their uninfected peers.\n\n【86】删除21:<u>Association between COVID-19 and myocarditis using hospital-based administrative data—United States, March 2020–January 2021.</u>\n\n【87】Another example is the risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) in women (30- to 49-year age group) after receipt of the Janssen vaccine. Per million doses administered in this age group, we prevent 10,000 cases of COVID-19, 900 hospitalizations, 140 intensive care unit admissions, and 20 deaths. The price we pay is 6 to 7 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and 8 to 10 cases of TTS.\n\n【88】删除21:<u>Use of COVID-19 vaccines after reports of adverse events among adult recipients of Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna): update from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices—United States, July 2021.</u>\n\n【89】Fortunately, we have other choices, like an mRNA vaccine, with which we can eliminate the risk of TTS. As a result, the CDC now recommends that an mRNA vaccine be used preferentially to the Janssen vaccine.\n\n【90】In summary, the new recommendation for mRNA vaccines to increase the interval between the first and second doses increases immunogenicity, decreases the risk of myocarditis, and improves antibody durability. This is tailored primarily toward healthy individuals 12 years and older and younger than 65 years but creates some degree of tension as there is not full protection until full immunization.\n\n【91】More recently, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of a protein nanoparticle platform vaccine (Novavax). This vaccine presents the spike protein and an adjuvant to the immune system with robust antibody formation. Longer term data are not yet available, nor are real-world effectiveness data in the face of evolving viral variants. Currently, the vaccine has been submitted for use as a booster, and the FDA has now approved this vaccine for use as a first booster.\n\n【92】### Multiorgan-Specific Subclinical Function\n\n【93】There are other highly significant risks of COVID-19 infection. The data to date reveal an alarming rate and breadth of end-organ long COVID complications and mental health issues.\n\n【94】In 1 study of 443 individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were multiple abnormal organ-specific findings that persisted 6 to 9 months after mild to moderate infection.\n\n【95】Multi-organ assessment in mainly non-hospitalized individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection: the Hamburg City Health Study COVID programme.\n\n【96】Another study reported large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in the respiratory tract but also in the cardiovascular system, lymph nodes, skeletal muscle, nerves, ocular tissue, optic nerve, and brain. Autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 protein expression in human cerebellum and Purkinje system in addition to blood vessels in the brain.\n\n【97】Another study looked at risks and 12-month burdens of incident post–acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes. Here again, regardless of age, COVID severity, and comorbidities, there was a profound excess risk burden per 1000 people of 20 different cardiovascular outcomes with a hazard ratio in the range of 2 to 4 for stroke, transient ischemic attack, arrhythmia, myocarditis, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and thrombotic disorders.\n\n【98】Finally, 1 study looked at mental health outcomes, particularly for those who were hospitalized with COVID-19, and found an elevated relative risk of a subsequent mental health diagnosis or mental health–related drug prescription.\n\n【99】More recently, a CDC study revealed evidence of long COVID symptoms in 20% to 25% of all COVID-19 cases.\n\n【100】删除21:<u>Post–COVID-19 conditions among adult COVID-19 survivors aged 18-64 and ≥65 years—United States, March 2020–November 2021.</u>\n\n【101】To date, the nature of postinfection symptoms remains unclear and is also associated with a variety of infections beyond COVID-19.\n\n【102】Glimmers of Hope and What Happens Next\n--------------------------------------\n\n【103】The question we are most often asked is, Are we heading into the endemic phase? There is no way to know. We believe that less severe variants may indicate movement into endemicity; however, to date, there is no evidence for this. In addition, we do not understand the biologic, virologic, and immunologic “rules” by which viruses become endemic with one exception: high levels of immunity in the population have a “forcing” action toward endemicity in general; but if immunity is not high enough, it can also act as a mutational pressure.\n\n【104】Unfortunately, because of how we failed to deal with the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 cannot now be eradicated. The multitude of reasons for this include human behavior and continued transmission, an animal reservoir (white-tailed deer, mink), waning immunity (both illness and vaccine induced), and importantly, continued viral mutation and recombination events. Therefore, we can confidently predict that our great-, great-, great-grandchildren will be getting COVID vaccines.\n\n【105】### Anticipations\n\n【106】What shall we expect in the future? One scenario is that SARS-CoV-2, under mutational and selective pressure and recombination events, further changes, allowing either significantly or somewhat enhanced transmissibility and virulence. The evidence for this is the observation of the continued generation of VOCs, such as BA.2.12, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75.2, and BA.4/5, and their subvariants; insufficient immunogenicity of the current vaccines against variants with greater antigenic distance, such as Omicron and Omicron subvariants; continued rejection of current vaccines; and escape from monoclonal antibody, convalescent plasma, and vaccine-induced antibodies.\n\n【107】The second scenario is that SARS-CoV-2 mutates into a virus with significantly less transmissibility and virulence, allowing movement into the endemic phase, probably with periodic epidemic seasons. The evidence for this is currently lacking. There is no evidence for less transmissibility, and whereas the virulence of Omicron may be less in those previously vaccinated, that is not true for those who are unvaccinated.\n\n【108】### Next-Generation Vaccines\n\n【109】New COVID-19 vaccine development continues. Second-generation vaccines will likely be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration during 2022 and into early 2023. The first of these, Novavax (recombinant S protein in a synthetic nanoparticle + Matrix-M), has already been approved. This is likely to be followed by vaccines being developed by Medicago (recombinant S protein VLP + AS03) and Sanofi/GSK (S protein produced in insect cells through baculovirus vector + AS03). So-called third-generation COVID vaccines may include oral and nasal spray formulations, peptide-based vaccines, and other novel formulations. Such vaccines offer the hope of inducing mucosal immunity, thereby blocking viral transmission and infection.\n\n【110】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【111】Finally, there is a significant likelihood of a worsening pandemic surge that the world will not be capable of mitigating in the face of the currently developing ultratransmissible Omicron subvariants. We must consider that SARS-CoV-2 is _controllable_ with proper masking and distancing. If we add vaccines, it is eminently controllable. Yet in the third decade of the 21st century, with more scientific/medical knowledge and resources than at any time in our history, we have generally proven ourselves incapable, nationally and globally, of responding in a _consistently_ rational manner. The evidence is overwhelming. Finally, over the horizon, areas of concern include unusual SARS-CoV-2 cryptic sequences that have been identified in New York City wastewater, early evidence of reverse zoonosis, and continued emergence of a variety of yet newer variants. We are also just starting to see the emergence and impact of the long-term population health effects of COVID-19 infection, including long COVID, predisposition to chronic illnesses, neuropsychiatric and behavioral/learning disabilities, and others that are yet to be recognized. The World Health Organization concluded in 2019 that vaccine hesitancy is one of the top 10 health threats to humans (that has turned out to be true), and wisdom dictates that unless we change our course of action, we will repeatedly see new variants that will drive continuing morbidity, mortality, and surge demands on the medical system. Such a course is untenable and immoral, given the profound suffering, morbidity, mortality, and effect on economies worldwide. Have we finally learned our lesson, or is it true that humankind never learns anything from history?\n\n【112】Potential Competing Interests\n-----------------------------\n\n【113】Dr. Poland is the chair of a Safety Evaluation Committee for novel investigational vaccine trials being conducted by Merck Research Laboratories.

Whereas 4 vaccines are approved in the United States and masks are widely available, too few are fully immunized and most of the population has stopped wearing protective masks. The ongoing consequences of this include continued excess morbidity and mortality and the generation of immune-evading variants and subvariants, which _in toto_ are injurious and ultimately self-defeating. Herein we briefly update and review COVID-19 vaccines, waning immunity, and new variants.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ), COVID-19 ( coronavirus disease 2019 ), RBD ( receptor-binding domain ), SARS-CoV-2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ), TTS ( thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome ), VOC ( variant of concern )\n\n【4】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus with a rapidly changing and highly mutable genotype. The available data are highly kinetic and dynamic, occurring in an environment of uncertainty but with periodic yet repeated surge-related morbidity and mortality coupled with and often driven by distorted human behavior.\n\n【5】The reality is that much of what we think we know about SARS-CoV-2 is likely wrong, outdated, tinged with false presuppositions, and often based on belief-dependent realism and tribalistic thinking. Instead, the best way of knowing truth for a scientific issue is the scientific method, although that can often be incompatible with what the public wants to believe.\n\n【6】Everything we understand thus far about SARS-CoV-2 is conditional on time, variant, geography, type of host immunity, host factors and behavior, population structure, and levels of immunity at the macro and micro levels; community burden of transmission; and the interplay among these. The story of this pandemic, when it is written, is going to be seen as highly dependent on and perturbed by both human and viral behavior. We only get to influence the first factor (human behavior), although it obviously influences the second (viral behavior). Therefore, we will continue to see the evolution of viral variants—some of which have developed, are developing, and will continue to develop the ability to evade, in whole or in part, both vaccine-induced and illness-induced immunity as well as prevention and treatment with antivirals and monoclonal antibodies.\n\n【7】**Harsh Truths**\n\n【8】The unfortunate and harsh truth about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States is that more than a million COVID-19 deaths have occurred as of this writing. There have been 225,000 confirmed COVID deaths in the United States thus far in 2022 alone, despite the widespread availability of safe and effective vaccines. One of every 303 Americans is now dead of COVID-19, with a continuing toll currently of 300 to 400 deaths per day. We have had more deaths nationwide than deaths due to the 1918 US influenza pandemic. A major reason for this is that currently only 68% of Americans are fully vaccinated and only 33% are boosted. Less than 10% of eligible Americans have received the newer updated bivalent booster.\n\n【9】If we examine the data from other developed countries with the ability to accurately track vaccine uptake, the United States has among the lowest percentage of the population that has received a booster dose, and therefore it is no surprise that we had more cumulative deaths per capita during the Omicron wave than any of these other countries. In fact, the United States has had the highest death rate of any of 21 other high-income countries.\n\n【10】Although it is unthinkable that this could be the case, we must accept that the data are the data. Globally, the World Health Organization has estimated that approximately 15 million people have died of COVID-19.\n\n【11】Brutal Realities of COVID-19 in the United States\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】An examination of the current average daily new COVID-19 cases reveals that the unvaccinated have about 3 times the rate of acquiring new cases compared with the fully vaccinated in addition to a 6-fold higher risk of death. Whereas death rates have fallen as of May 2022, case rates soared to more than 100,000 new cases in the United States per day through the spring and summer of 2022, and this is likely to be a vast underestimate because of extensive home testing that is never reported. Yet, consistent with belief-dependent realism, no amount of data has swayed vaccine-hesitant and vaccine-rejecting individuals.\n\n【13】Multiple distorting human factors have an impact on the ability to manage the pandemic, from individual and collective human behavior patterns to a false epistemology by which the public attempts to understand and manage the pandemic. Human behavior during the pandemic has included vaccine hesitancy and rejection; rejection of masks; political and economic conflicts of interest; lack of leadership; and the discovery of animal reservoirs, such as the white-tailed deer and mink, that have been infected by human activity. In addition, we are dealing with pathologic cultural narcissism (a “me” not “we” mentality) and the false presupposition of the democratization of expertise. These factors are and have been injurious, self-defeating, and self-destructive. Ultimately, and indicative of massive issues that will occur into the future, we have lost any collective transcendent reference points by which we make decisions and act for one another’s and society’s interest.\n\n【14】### SARS-CoV-2 Variants and the Lies We Tell Ourselves\n\n【15】The spike protein projecting from SARS-CoV-2 is composed of a number of parts, primarily the S2 and S1 domains, and contained within the S1 or distal part of the spike protein is the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The RBD binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, allowing the virus to enter the cell and to hijack host cellular machinery to manufacture massive numbers of viral progeny.\n\n【16】If we examine the number and location of mutations in 3 SARS-CoV-2 variants (wild type, Delta, and Omicron), one is struck by the significantly enhanced numbers of mutations from the original Wuhan ancestral strain to the Omicron variant. Not surprisingly, many of those mutations have accumulated in the RBD. As a result, as these types of variants arise, we begin to lose some level of effectiveness from illness-induced and vaccine-induced immunity as well as the efficacy of specific monoclonal antibodies as the virus mutates to evade immunity. The pattern of viral mutations often exactly matches the binding site between viral RBD and monoclonal antibody binding, accounting for loss of neutralizing activity.\n\n【17】Since December 2021, the predominant circulating variant in the United States has been the Omicron variant. Importantly, this was completely unpredictable as the expectation was that Delta subvariants would be next to arise. The Omicron variant was isolated in Botswana in November 2021 and then rapidly spread throughout South Africa and the rest of the world. Even though we have previously observed this type of pattern globally, if we go back to that early December 2021 time frame, most of the world believed Omicron would not be a problem. Omicron subsequently became widely geographically dispersed. It is significantly more transmissible than Delta but fortunately seems to have somewhat lower virulence compared with Delta, probably because of its propensity for upper rather than lower airway infection, and some level of population immunity. Omicron demonstrated a larger genetic distance than any other variant of concern (VOC) from the ancestral strain\n\n【18】mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine boosters induce neutralizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.\n\n【19】and is better able to escape illness and vaccine-induced immunity compared with other VOCs as well as to evade the therapeutic effect of monoclonal antibodies. One consequence of this enhanced transmissibility is the significantly enhanced infection rate of children vs the other VOCs.\n\n【20】### BA.2—“Stealth” Omicron\n\n【21】Although we again heard that it would not be an important public health issue, BA.2, the “stealth” Omicron, represented most new cases globally by April 2022. For example, the incidence in the Republic of South Africa went from about 22% of sequenced viruses to 86% between February 4 and February 11, 2022, and BA.2 subsequently outcompeted Omicron globally. It is approximately 30% more transmissible than Omicron. There is evidence of increased virulence and immune evasion capability with reduced efficacy of sotrovimab and a requirement for double the dose of tixagevimab-cilgavimab as prophylaxis. Since May, the United States and Europe have experienced yet another wave of COVID-19, this time due to Omicron subvariants—BA 2.12, BA 2.12.1, and BA 4/5. Currently, a variant under monitoring is the BA 2.75.2 subvariant, which may further evade illness and vaccine-induced immunity as well as all monoclonal antibodies except bebtelovimab. More worrisome has been the rapid evolution and spread of additional Omicron subvariants, including BA.5 variants (BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BF.7, BQ.X, XBB, BJ.1, other), BA.2 variants (BA.2.75.2, BS.1), BA.4 variants (BA.4.6), and others. Several of these arising variants may very well evade, in whole or in part, vaccine- and illness-induced immunity as well as monoclonal antibodies.\n\n【22】### What Should We Be Most Concerned With—Transmissibility or Virulence?\n\n【23】In addition to viral virulence, we must also be concerned with viral transmissibility. As an example, let us take a baseline community that has a steady 10,000 infections. Let us assume that each new case generates an average of 1.1 new cases and that around 0.8% of new cases result in death. In 1 month’s time, approximately 129 deaths would be expected. However, what happens if the virus is 50% more lethal, like Delta? The number of deaths would jump to nearly 200 in 1 month. Instead of changing lethality, what if we instead make the virus 50% more contagious, like Omicron? Now, after a month, there are 978 deaths—or a 658% increase!\n\n【24】That is what causes exponential spread. Human decision makers cannot deal, in a timely manner, with exponentiality. They always get it wrong, hence the astounding and continuing levels of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.\n\n【25】Another way to think about exponentiality is by taking 2 scenarios, assuming 10 cycles of transmission in a naive population, where we vary R <sub>0 </sub> , which is the basic reproductive rate of the virus—a measure of how many people, on average, an infected person would subsequently infect\n\n【26】:\n\n【27】*   •\n\n【28】    Scenario A with R <sub>0 </sub> \\= 2.5: leads to 9536 infections\n\n【29】*   •\n\n【30】    Scenario B with R <sub>0 </sub> \\= 6: leads to 60,466,176 infections\n\n【31】This important principle of exponentiality is what allowed us to predict that Omicron would lead to a worse surge and more deaths compared with Delta, which was counterintuitive to many decision makers. In fact, compared with the 2021 winter peak, Omicron cases rose 300%; hospitalizations, 115%; and deaths, 59%. Worse, the newer Omicron subvariants demonstrate R <sub>0 </sub> values closer to 12, accounting for the significant surge in new cases in the United States.\n\n【32】COVID-19 Vaccine—Efficacy and Effectiveness\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【33】When it comes to vaccine efficacy, there is a complex interplay between host characteristics, pathogen characteristics, vaccine type, time since vaccination, and geography. Host characteristics include demographic differences, genetic factors, existing immunity, and comorbidities. Virus characteristics include the specific variant, inoculum size, and portal of entry.\n\n【34】### What Is Vaccine Efficacy?\n\n【35】Vaccine efficacy can be viewed as a gradient of protection. Like virtually all our vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are far better at blocking _disease_ vs blocking _infection_ . If we look at prevention of death, the mRNA vaccines were reported as 95% efficacious (against the Alpha variant); but if we look at asymptomatic infection and transmission, depending on the amount of time lapsed since last dose, it could be 0% to 40%. Vaccine efficacy depends on multiple factors, such as the underlying immune system health (innate, adaptive humoral, adaptive cellular) in the host, preexisting immunity, predominant circulating variant, community burden of transmission, and genetic factors. Overall, for the population, we can consider that there are 3 “enemies” to the development of immunity after vaccination: age, variant, and time.\n\n【36】With age comes immunosenescence and decreased vaccine immunogenicity along with a growing number of medical comorbidities. In general, if we look at people who were immunized in their 20s to 40s, they develop an abundant antibody response. On the other hand, people immunized in their 60s to 80s with the same vaccine under the same conditions develop a much lower level of antibodies. So, with age, we generally become more susceptible to infection and develop less robust immune responses to vaccines, a condition known as immunosenescence.\n\n【37】Age-dependent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and P.1 variant by vaccine immune serum samples.\n\n【38】With new variants have come mutations and recombination events resulting in immune evasion and the decreased ability of neutralizing antibody to bind virus and to block attachment to cell receptors. We see a similar trend in looking at the effect of VOC plus age. For example, if we measure neutralization of both the WA1/2020 strain and P1 variant, we find that not only does neutralizing ability wane with time, but at any one time point there is a difference (decrease) in the amount of measurable neutralizing antibodies by increasing age.\n\n【39】Age-dependent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and P.1 variant by vaccine immune serum samples.\n\n【40】In 1 study, there was a measurable and highly significant 22-fold drop in neutralization of the Omicron variant by Pfizer vaccine–elicited immunity.\n\n【41】Omicron extensively but incompletely escapes Pfizer BNT162b2 neutralization.\n\n【42】So logically, even vaccinated individuals are going to become more susceptible to infection in a shorter time due to Omicron and Omicron subvariants circulating, and of course, this is exactly what has happened.\n\n【43】If we look at the first 3 approved vaccines in the United States and track the hazard ratio for becoming polymerase chain reaction positive (ie, infected) after adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, sex, and comorbidities, Janssen wanes the fastest, followed by Pfizer, followed by Moderna, the last being most likely a dose effect.\n\n【44】Thus, with increasing time, antibody levels and therefore protection do decrease. Vaccine effectiveness for infection over time also differs among the 3 vaccines. During a 6-month period, effectiveness against infection for adults in the United States wanes from about 89% to 58% with Moderna, from 87% to 43% with Pfizer, and from 86% to 13% with Janssen.\n\n【45】Effectiveness against death and severe disease, however, is relatively well maintained, which reflects the gradient of protection previously discussed. This likely reflects the fact that prevention of disease tends to be more T-cell mediated, whereas prevention of infection is B-cell mediated.\n\n【46】Effectiveness of mRNA BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine up to 6 months in a large integrated health system in the USA: a retrospective cohort study.\n\n【47】Unfortunately, we do not have a suitable standardized method for routine measurement of cellular immune responses to vaccination for clinical use. Newer data on Pfizer vaccine effectiveness showed the same trend.\n\n【48】删除21:<u>Effectiveness of COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in preventing COVID-19–associated emergency department and urgent care encounters and hospitalizations among nonimmunocompromised children and adolescents aged 5-17 years—VISION Network, 10 states, April 2021–January 2022.</u>\n\n【49】During an Omicron-predominant time period, effectiveness in healthy 12- to 15-year-olds against emergency department/urgent care visits after 2 vaccine doses (14 to 149 days earlier) was 45%, with no measurable efficacy after 150 days. We see the same phenomenon if we look at the same data for healthy 16- to 17-year-olds, but if they received 3 doses, vaccine effectiveness was boosted back up to 81%. Regardless, in both age groups, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was relatively maintained at very high levels even after 150 days.\n\n【50】### Why Do Breakthrough Cases Occur?\n\n【51】Breakthrough cases are the predictable and expected result of a collision of waning immunity, new variants with immune-evading capability, high community burden of transmission, and inherent host factors as discussed here.\n\n【52】#### Booster Doses and the Wobble Stage\n\n【53】There is a theoretical construct vaccinologists use when thinking about delivering vaccines to a population in the context of an emerging pathogen for which there is no prior immunity. The main principles of this construct include the following:\n\n【54】*   •\n\n【55】    Building population-level immunity quickly. Unfortunately, we were not successful in doing that because of vaccine hesitancy and rejection.\n\n【56】*   •\n\n【57】    Rebuilding immunity as it wanes with time. Boosters are required, but even they will wane with time, and far fewer people received timely boosters.\n\n【58】*   •\n\n【59】    Eventually, as in the case of SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/5 and subvariants, a new variant develops that requires refocusing immunity to that viral variant with a variant-focused vaccine booster. This is the wobble stage that we are in right now.\n\n【60】#### Real-World Effectiveness Data\n\n【61】Individuals who received the primary Pfizer series and then were boosted barely accumulate any measurable risks of hospitalization, whereas those who received only 2 doses suffer from more hospitalizations. This is true for both severe disease and death.\n\n【62】Effectiveness of a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for preventing severe outcomes in Israel: an observational study.\n\n【63】If we analyze homologous vs heterologous boosting, after the administration of 2 doses of Pfizer vaccine, there is waning of vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant but much faster and significant waning of vaccine effectiveness against variants like Omicron. When we add a Pfizer booster dose, we get a profound boost in vaccine effectiveness that begins to wane quickly. On the other hand, when the booster dose is Moderna (heterologous boosting), effectiveness seems to be better. Thus, a “mix and match” strategy may offer some slight benefit.\n\n【64】Pfizer vaccine data in the elderly reveal a similar story.\n\n【65】Durability of omicron-neutralising serum activity after mRNA booster immunisation in older adults.\n\n【66】Measurable neutralizing ability was somewhat depressed for the Delta strain vs the Wuhan strain but profoundly depressed for Omicron. The neutralizing ability improves with boosting but wanes again and is more suppressed with Omicron compared with Delta and Wuhan. Moderna vaccine was also effective against infection after the second dose with waning over time, especially against Omicron. When boosted, effectiveness improves, but similarly more waning of immunity was observed with Omicron than with Delta.\n\n【67】Effectiveness of mRNA-1273 against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta variants.\n\n【68】There seems to be consistency across the vaccines, with slightly better neutralization capability of Moderna vs Pfizer. The major point is that allowing continued viral transmission in the population will continue to result in the development of variants that will “learn” how to evade immunity by means of mutation and recombination.\n\n【69】#### Vaccine Effectiveness Against Hospitalizations\n\n【70】During the Omicron-predominant period through January 2021, after 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine, effectiveness against infection fell dramatically after 5 months to the 50% range. However, with a third dose (booster dose 1), it goes back up into the 90% range but subsequently falls into the 80% range and continues to gradually wane with time. Thus, booster doses are critical in providing the maximum amount of protection against infection, hospitalization, severe disease, and death.\n\n【71】删除21:<u>Waning 2-dose and 3-dose effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19–associated emergency department and urgent care encounters and hospitalizations among adults during periods of Delta and Omicron variant predominance—VISION Network, 10 states, August 2021–January 2022.</u>\n\n【72】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【73】### Vaccine Recommendations\n\n【74】As a result of the preceding, we have seen the evolution of recommendations for vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now allow that the second dose can be delayed up to 8 weeks after the first dose for those who are otherwise healthy and who are older than 12 years and younger than 65 years. The reason is that the longer the interval between doses, the better the immunogenicity and durability with reduced adverse effects. In fact, there is early evidence that we can decrease the already small risk of myocarditis by expanding that interval. The issue is that until 2 doses have been received, protection against disease is compromised. As for the Janssen vaccine, the most recent recommendation is to subsequently boost with an mRNA vaccine. In the immunocompromised host, 2 doses are given, with a later additional dose (third dose) followed by a booster dose (fourth dose) 2 or more months after the third dose. For nonimmunocompromised persons, a newer bivalent mRNA booster is available, as is a protein subunit vaccine for use as a booster 2 or more months after the last vaccine dose. These recommendations will continue to evolve as more data become available and with the advent of new boosters and new variants that threaten health, and the CDC vaccine guidance charts should be consulted.\n\n【75】### Vaccine Safety\n\n【76】It is important to communicate that there is no such thing as “safe” with any human-made product. There is only the balance between risk and benefit and therefore the concept of “safer.” Wisdom, then, resides in guiding patients in which risks to undertake for the most benefit as there is no risk-free pathway. There are only 4 choices: COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, passive immunity, and absolute isolation. As the Janssen vaccine is no longer a preferred vaccine, here we primarily comment on the issue of myocarditis.\n\n【77】#### Myocarditis/Myopericarditis\n\n【78】The predominant risk discussed in the media due to COVID-19 vaccination is myopericarditis. There is relatively little risk of myocarditis/myopericarditis after the first dose regardless of which mRNA vaccine is administered. The second dose appears to be the issue, hence the recommendation of increasing the time interval between doses. There appears to be a greater risk with Moderna vaccine (probably because of dose) compared with Pfizer vaccine.\n\n【79】SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and myocarditis or myopericarditis: population based cohort study.\n\n【80】If we look at a 7-day risk interval per million doses given, we find that this is a male-predominant adverse effect that happens significantly less often in female patients. It is more common during the pubertal period but can still happen in older individuals but with much less frequency.\n\n【81】删除21:<u>Myocarditis cases reported after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination in the US from December 2020 to August 2021.</u>\n\n【82】Examining risks vs benefits reveals that if we administer 1 million doses of an mRNA vaccine to men aged 16 to 17 years, we prevent about 57,000 cases of COVID-19, 500 COVID-19–related hospitalizations, and 170 COVID-19–related intensive care unit admissions. The price we pay is 73 cases of vaccine-associated myocarditis.\n\n【83】If we examine the number of excess events due to vaccine exposure per million exposed, we find a significantly smaller number for myocarditis in those who received a dose or 2 doses of mRNA vaccines compared with myocarditis in those who became COVID-19 infected. When we look at pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias, it is almost always related to the infection.\n\n【84】Risks of myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias associated with COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【85】As another example, the risk of myocarditis in patients with COVID-19 is about 16 times higher vs that in noninfected people. The myocarditis risk is 37 times higher for infected children younger than 16 years and 7 times higher for infected people aged 16 to 39 years compared with their uninfected peers.\n\n【86】删除21:<u>Association between COVID-19 and myocarditis using hospital-based administrative data—United States, March 2020–January 2021.</u>\n\n【87】Another example is the risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) in women (30- to 49-year age group) after receipt of the Janssen vaccine. Per million doses administered in this age group, we prevent 10,000 cases of COVID-19, 900 hospitalizations, 140 intensive care unit admissions, and 20 deaths. The price we pay is 6 to 7 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and 8 to 10 cases of TTS.\n\n【88】删除21:<u>Use of COVID-19 vaccines after reports of adverse events among adult recipients of Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna): update from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices—United States, July 2021.</u>\n\n【89】Fortunately, we have other choices, like an mRNA vaccine, with which we can eliminate the risk of TTS. As a result, the CDC now recommends that an mRNA vaccine be used preferentially to the Janssen vaccine.\n\n【90】In summary, the new recommendation for mRNA vaccines to increase the interval between the first and second doses increases immunogenicity, decreases the risk of myocarditis, and improves antibody durability. This is tailored primarily toward healthy individuals 12 years and older and younger than 65 years but creates some degree of tension as there is not full protection until full immunization.\n\n【91】More recently, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of a protein nanoparticle platform vaccine (Novavax). This vaccine presents the spike protein and an adjuvant to the immune system with robust antibody formation. Longer term data are not yet available, nor are real-world effectiveness data in the face of evolving viral variants. Currently, the vaccine has been submitted for use as a booster, and the FDA has now approved this vaccine for use as a first booster.\n\n【92】### Multiorgan-Specific Subclinical Function\n\n【93】There are other highly significant risks of COVID-19 infection. The data to date reveal an alarming rate and breadth of end-organ long COVID complications and mental health issues.\n\n【94】In 1 study of 443 individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were multiple abnormal organ-specific findings that persisted 6 to 9 months after mild to moderate infection.\n\n【95】Multi-organ assessment in mainly non-hospitalized individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection: the Hamburg City Health Study COVID programme.\n\n【96】Another study reported large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in the respiratory tract but also in the cardiovascular system, lymph nodes, skeletal muscle, nerves, ocular tissue, optic nerve, and brain. Autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 protein expression in human cerebellum and Purkinje system in addition to blood vessels in the brain.\n\n【97】Another study looked at risks and 12-month burdens of incident post–acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes. Here again, regardless of age, COVID severity, and comorbidities, there was a profound excess risk burden per 1000 people of 20 different cardiovascular outcomes with a hazard ratio in the range of 2 to 4 for stroke, transient ischemic attack, arrhythmia, myocarditis, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and thrombotic disorders.\n\n【98】Finally, 1 study looked at mental health outcomes, particularly for those who were hospitalized with COVID-19, and found an elevated relative risk of a subsequent mental health diagnosis or mental health–related drug prescription.\n\n【99】More recently, a CDC study revealed evidence of long COVID symptoms in 20% to 25% of all COVID-19 cases.\n\n【100】删除21:<u>Post–COVID-19 conditions among adult COVID-19 survivors aged 18-64 and ≥65 years—United States, March 2020–November 2021.</u>\n\n【101】To date, the nature of postinfection symptoms remains unclear and is also associated with a variety of infections beyond COVID-19.\n\n【102】Glimmers of Hope and What Happens Next\n--------------------------------------\n\n【103】The question we are most often asked is, Are we heading into the endemic phase? There is no way to know. We believe that less severe variants may indicate movement into endemicity; however, to date, there is no evidence for this. In addition, we do not understand the biologic, virologic, and immunologic “rules” by which viruses become endemic with one exception: high levels of immunity in the population have a “forcing” action toward endemicity in general; but if immunity is not high enough, it can also act as a mutational pressure.\n\n【104】Unfortunately, because of how we failed to deal with the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 cannot now be eradicated. The multitude of reasons for this include human behavior and continued transmission, an animal reservoir (white-tailed deer, mink), waning immunity (both illness and vaccine induced), and importantly, continued viral mutation and recombination events. Therefore, we can confidently predict that our great-, great-, great-grandchildren will be getting COVID vaccines.\n\n【105】### Anticipations\n\n【106】What shall we expect in the future? One scenario is that SARS-CoV-2, under mutational and selective pressure and recombination events, further changes, allowing either significantly or somewhat enhanced transmissibility and virulence. The evidence for this is the observation of the continued generation of VOCs, such as BA.2.12, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75.2, and BA.4/5, and their subvariants; insufficient immunogenicity of the current vaccines against variants with greater antigenic distance, such as Omicron and Omicron subvariants; continued rejection of current vaccines; and escape from monoclonal antibody, convalescent plasma, and vaccine-induced antibodies.\n\n【107】The second scenario is that SARS-CoV-2 mutates into a virus with significantly less transmissibility and virulence, allowing movement into the endemic phase, probably with periodic epidemic seasons. The evidence for this is currently lacking. There is no evidence for less transmissibility, and whereas the virulence of Omicron may be less in those previously vaccinated, that is not true for those who are unvaccinated.\n\n【108】### Next-Generation Vaccines\n\n【109】New COVID-19 vaccine development continues. Second-generation vaccines will likely be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration during 2022 and into early 2023. The first of these, Novavax (recombinant S protein in a synthetic nanoparticle + Matrix-M), has already been approved. This is likely to be followed by vaccines being developed by Medicago (recombinant S protein VLP + AS03) and Sanofi/GSK (S protein produced in insect cells through baculovirus vector + AS03). So-called third-generation COVID vaccines may include oral and nasal spray formulations, peptide-based vaccines, and other novel formulations. Such vaccines offer the hope of inducing mucosal immunity, thereby blocking viral transmission and infection.\n\n【110】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【111】Finally, there is a significant likelihood of a worsening pandemic surge that the world will not be capable of mitigating in the face of the currently developing ultratransmissible Omicron subvariants. We must consider that SARS-CoV-2 is _controllable_ with proper masking and distancing. If we add vaccines, it is eminently controllable. Yet in the third decade of the 21st century, with more scientific/medical knowledge and resources than at any time in our history, we have generally proven ourselves incapable, nationally and globally, of responding in a _consistently_ rational manner. The evidence is overwhelming. Finally, over the horizon, areas of concern include unusual SARS-CoV-2 cryptic sequences that have been identified in New York City wastewater, early evidence of reverse zoonosis, and continued emergence of a variety of yet newer variants. We are also just starting to see the emergence and impact of the long-term population health effects of COVID-19 infection, including long COVID, predisposition to chronic illnesses, neuropsychiatric and behavioral/learning disabilities, and others that are yet to be recognized. The World Health Organization concluded in 2019 that vaccine hesitancy is one of the top 10 health threats to humans (that has turned out to be true), and wisdom dictates that unless we change our course of action, we will repeatedly see new variants that will drive continuing morbidity, mortality, and surge demands on the medical system. Such a course is untenable and immoral, given the profound suffering, morbidity, mortality, and effect on economies worldwide. Have we finally learned our lesson, or is it true that humankind never learns anything from history?\n\n【112】Potential Competing Interests\n-----------------------------\n\n【113】Dr. Poland is the chair of a Safety Evaluation Committee for novel investigational vaccine trials being conducted by Merck Research Laboratories.

Whereas 4 vaccines are approved in the United States and masks are widely available, too few are fully immunized and most of the population has stopped wearing protective masks. The ongoing consequences of this include continued excess morbidity and mortality and the generation of immune-evading variants and subvariants, which _in toto_ are injurious and ultimately self-defeating. Herein we briefly update and review COVID-19 vaccines, waning immunity, and new variants.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CDC ( Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ), COVID-19 ( coronavirus disease 2019 ), RBD ( receptor-binding domain ), SARS-CoV-2 ( severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ), TTS ( thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome ), VOC ( variant of concern )\n\n【4】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus with a rapidly changing and highly mutable genotype. The available data are highly kinetic and dynamic, occurring in an environment of uncertainty but with periodic yet repeated surge-related morbidity and mortality coupled with and often driven by distorted human behavior.\n\n【5】The reality is that much of what we think we know about SARS-CoV-2 is likely wrong, outdated, tinged with false presuppositions, and often based on belief-dependent realism and tribalistic thinking. Instead, the best way of knowing truth for a scientific issue is the scientific method, although that can often be incompatible with what the public wants to believe.\n\n【6】Everything we understand thus far about SARS-CoV-2 is conditional on time, variant, geography, type of host immunity, host factors and behavior, population structure, and levels of immunity at the macro and micro levels; community burden of transmission; and the interplay among these. The story of this pandemic, when it is written, is going to be seen as highly dependent on and perturbed by both human and viral behavior. We only get to influence the first factor (human behavior), although it obviously influences the second (viral behavior). Therefore, we will continue to see the evolution of viral variants—some of which have developed, are developing, and will continue to develop the ability to evade, in whole or in part, both vaccine-induced and illness-induced immunity as well as prevention and treatment with antivirals and monoclonal antibodies.\n\n【7】**Harsh Truths**\n\n【8】The unfortunate and harsh truth about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States is that more than a million COVID-19 deaths have occurred as of this writing. There have been 225,000 confirmed COVID deaths in the United States thus far in 2022 alone, despite the widespread availability of safe and effective vaccines. One of every 303 Americans is now dead of COVID-19, with a continuing toll currently of 300 to 400 deaths per day. We have had more deaths nationwide than deaths due to the 1918 US influenza pandemic. A major reason for this is that currently only 68% of Americans are fully vaccinated and only 33% are boosted. Less than 10% of eligible Americans have received the newer updated bivalent booster.\n\n【9】If we examine the data from other developed countries with the ability to accurately track vaccine uptake, the United States has among the lowest percentage of the population that has received a booster dose, and therefore it is no surprise that we had more cumulative deaths per capita during the Omicron wave than any of these other countries. In fact, the United States has had the highest death rate of any of 21 other high-income countries.\n\n【10】Although it is unthinkable that this could be the case, we must accept that the data are the data. Globally, the World Health Organization has estimated that approximately 15 million people have died of COVID-19.\n\n【11】Brutal Realities of COVID-19 in the United States\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】An examination of the current average daily new COVID-19 cases reveals that the unvaccinated have about 3 times the rate of acquiring new cases compared with the fully vaccinated in addition to a 6-fold higher risk of death. Whereas death rates have fallen as of May 2022, case rates soared to more than 100,000 new cases in the United States per day through the spring and summer of 2022, and this is likely to be a vast underestimate because of extensive home testing that is never reported. Yet, consistent with belief-dependent realism, no amount of data has swayed vaccine-hesitant and vaccine-rejecting individuals.\n\n【13】Multiple distorting human factors have an impact on the ability to manage the pandemic, from individual and collective human behavior patterns to a false epistemology by which the public attempts to understand and manage the pandemic. Human behavior during the pandemic has included vaccine hesitancy and rejection; rejection of masks; political and economic conflicts of interest; lack of leadership; and the discovery of animal reservoirs, such as the white-tailed deer and mink, that have been infected by human activity. In addition, we are dealing with pathologic cultural narcissism (a “me” not “we” mentality) and the false presupposition of the democratization of expertise. These factors are and have been injurious, self-defeating, and self-destructive. Ultimately, and indicative of massive issues that will occur into the future, we have lost any collective transcendent reference points by which we make decisions and act for one another’s and society’s interest.\n\n【14】### SARS-CoV-2 Variants and the Lies We Tell Ourselves\n\n【15】The spike protein projecting from SARS-CoV-2 is composed of a number of parts, primarily the S2 and S1 domains, and contained within the S1 or distal part of the spike protein is the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The RBD binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor, allowing the virus to enter the cell and to hijack host cellular machinery to manufacture massive numbers of viral progeny.\n\n【16】If we examine the number and location of mutations in 3 SARS-CoV-2 variants (wild type, Delta, and Omicron), one is struck by the significantly enhanced numbers of mutations from the original Wuhan ancestral strain to the Omicron variant. Not surprisingly, many of those mutations have accumulated in the RBD. As a result, as these types of variants arise, we begin to lose some level of effectiveness from illness-induced and vaccine-induced immunity as well as the efficacy of specific monoclonal antibodies as the virus mutates to evade immunity. The pattern of viral mutations often exactly matches the binding site between viral RBD and monoclonal antibody binding, accounting for loss of neutralizing activity.\n\n【17】Since December 2021, the predominant circulating variant in the United States has been the Omicron variant. Importantly, this was completely unpredictable as the expectation was that Delta subvariants would be next to arise. The Omicron variant was isolated in Botswana in November 2021 and then rapidly spread throughout South Africa and the rest of the world. Even though we have previously observed this type of pattern globally, if we go back to that early December 2021 time frame, most of the world believed Omicron would not be a problem. Omicron subsequently became widely geographically dispersed. It is significantly more transmissible than Delta but fortunately seems to have somewhat lower virulence compared with Delta, probably because of its propensity for upper rather than lower airway infection, and some level of population immunity. Omicron demonstrated a larger genetic distance than any other variant of concern (VOC) from the ancestral strain\n\n【18】mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine boosters induce neutralizing immunity against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant.\n\n【19】and is better able to escape illness and vaccine-induced immunity compared with other VOCs as well as to evade the therapeutic effect of monoclonal antibodies. One consequence of this enhanced transmissibility is the significantly enhanced infection rate of children vs the other VOCs.\n\n【20】### BA.2—“Stealth” Omicron\n\n【21】Although we again heard that it would not be an important public health issue, BA.2, the “stealth” Omicron, represented most new cases globally by April 2022. For example, the incidence in the Republic of South Africa went from about 22% of sequenced viruses to 86% between February 4 and February 11, 2022, and BA.2 subsequently outcompeted Omicron globally. It is approximately 30% more transmissible than Omicron. There is evidence of increased virulence and immune evasion capability with reduced efficacy of sotrovimab and a requirement for double the dose of tixagevimab-cilgavimab as prophylaxis. Since May, the United States and Europe have experienced yet another wave of COVID-19, this time due to Omicron subvariants—BA 2.12, BA 2.12.1, and BA 4/5. Currently, a variant under monitoring is the BA 2.75.2 subvariant, which may further evade illness and vaccine-induced immunity as well as all monoclonal antibodies except bebtelovimab. More worrisome has been the rapid evolution and spread of additional Omicron subvariants, including BA.5 variants (BQ.1, BQ.1.1, BF.7, BQ.X, XBB, BJ.1, other), BA.2 variants (BA.2.75.2, BS.1), BA.4 variants (BA.4.6), and others. Several of these arising variants may very well evade, in whole or in part, vaccine- and illness-induced immunity as well as monoclonal antibodies.\n\n【22】### What Should We Be Most Concerned With—Transmissibility or Virulence?\n\n【23】In addition to viral virulence, we must also be concerned with viral transmissibility. As an example, let us take a baseline community that has a steady 10,000 infections. Let us assume that each new case generates an average of 1.1 new cases and that around 0.8% of new cases result in death. In 1 month’s time, approximately 129 deaths would be expected. However, what happens if the virus is 50% more lethal, like Delta? The number of deaths would jump to nearly 200 in 1 month. Instead of changing lethality, what if we instead make the virus 50% more contagious, like Omicron? Now, after a month, there are 978 deaths—or a 658% increase!\n\n【24】That is what causes exponential spread. Human decision makers cannot deal, in a timely manner, with exponentiality. They always get it wrong, hence the astounding and continuing levels of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.\n\n【25】Another way to think about exponentiality is by taking 2 scenarios, assuming 10 cycles of transmission in a naive population, where we vary R <sub>0 </sub> , which is the basic reproductive rate of the virus—a measure of how many people, on average, an infected person would subsequently infect\n\n<mark>【26】:</mark>\n\n【27】*   •\n\n【28】    Scenario A with R <sub>0 </sub> \\= 2.5: leads to 9536 infections\n\n【29】*   •\n\n【30】    Scenario B with R <sub>0 </sub> \\= 6: leads to 60,466,176 infections\n\n【31】This important principle of exponentiality is what allowed us to predict that Omicron would lead to a worse surge and more deaths compared with Delta, which was counterintuitive to many decision makers. In fact, compared with the 2021 winter peak, Omicron cases rose 300%; hospitalizations, 115%; and deaths, 59%. Worse, the newer Omicron subvariants demonstrate R <sub>0 </sub> values closer to 12, accounting for the significant surge in new cases in the United States.\n\n【32】COVID-19 Vaccine—Efficacy and Effectiveness\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【33】When it comes to vaccine efficacy, there is a complex interplay between host characteristics, pathogen characteristics, vaccine type, time since vaccination, and geography. Host characteristics include demographic differences, genetic factors, existing immunity, and comorbidities. Virus characteristics include the specific variant, inoculum size, and portal of entry.\n\n【34】### What Is Vaccine Efficacy?\n\n【35】Vaccine efficacy can be viewed as a gradient of protection. Like virtually all our vaccines, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are far better at blocking _disease_ vs blocking _infection_ . If we look at prevention of death, the mRNA vaccines were reported as 95% efficacious (against the Alpha variant); but if we look at asymptomatic infection and transmission, depending on the amount of time lapsed since last dose, it could be 0% to 40%. Vaccine efficacy depends on multiple factors, such as the underlying immune system health (innate, adaptive humoral, adaptive cellular) in the host, preexisting immunity, predominant circulating variant, community burden of transmission, and genetic factors. Overall, for the population, we can consider that there are 3 “enemies” to the development of immunity after vaccination: age, variant, and time.\n\n【36】With age comes immunosenescence and decreased vaccine immunogenicity along with a growing number of medical comorbidities. In general, if we look at people who were immunized in their 20s to 40s, they develop an abundant antibody response. On the other hand, people immunized in their 60s to 80s with the same vaccine under the same conditions develop a much lower level of antibodies. So, with age, we generally become more susceptible to infection and develop less robust immune responses to vaccines, a condition known as immunosenescence.\n\n【37】Age-dependent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and P.1 variant by vaccine immune serum samples.\n\n【38】With new variants have come mutations and recombination events resulting in immune evasion and the decreased ability of neutralizing antibody to bind virus and to block attachment to cell receptors. We see a similar trend in looking at the effect of VOC plus age. For example, if we measure neutralization of both the WA1/2020 strain and P1 variant, we find that not only does neutralizing ability wane with time, but at any one time point there is a difference (decrease) in the amount of measurable neutralizing antibodies by increasing age.\n\n【39】Age-dependent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 and P.1 variant by vaccine immune serum samples.\n\n【40】In 1 study, there was a measurable and highly significant 22-fold drop in neutralization of the Omicron variant by Pfizer vaccine–elicited immunity.\n\n【41】Omicron extensively but incompletely escapes Pfizer BNT162b2 neutralization.\n\n【42】So logically, even vaccinated individuals are going to become more susceptible to infection in a shorter time due to Omicron and Omicron subvariants circulating, and of course, this is exactly what has happened.\n\n【43】If we look at the first 3 approved vaccines in the United States and track the hazard ratio for becoming polymerase chain reaction positive (ie, infected) after adjusting for age, race, ethnicity, sex, and comorbidities, Janssen wanes the fastest, followed by Pfizer, followed by Moderna, the last being most likely a dose effect.\n\n【44】Thus, with increasing time, antibody levels and therefore protection do decrease. Vaccine effectiveness for infection over time also differs among the 3 vaccines. During a 6-month period, effectiveness against infection for adults in the United States wanes from about 89% to 58% with Moderna, from 87% to 43% with Pfizer, and from 86% to 13% with Janssen.\n\n【45】Effectiveness against death and severe disease, however, is relatively well maintained, which reflects the gradient of protection previously discussed. This likely reflects the fact that prevention of disease tends to be more T-cell mediated, whereas prevention of infection is B-cell mediated.\n\n【46】Effectiveness of mRNA BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine up to 6 months in a large integrated health system in the USA: a retrospective cohort study.\n\n【47】Unfortunately, we do not have a suitable standardized method for routine measurement of cellular immune responses to vaccination for clinical use. Newer data on Pfizer vaccine effectiveness showed the same trend.\n\n【48】删除21:<u>Effectiveness of COVID-19 Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination in preventing COVID-19–associated emergency department and urgent care encounters and hospitalizations among nonimmunocompromised children and adolescents aged 5-17 years—VISION Network, 10 states, April 2021–January 2022.</u>\n\n【49】During an Omicron-predominant time period, effectiveness in healthy 12- to 15-year-olds against emergency department/urgent care visits after 2 vaccine doses (14 to 149 days earlier) was 45%, with no measurable efficacy after 150 days. We see the same phenomenon if we look at the same data for healthy 16- to 17-year-olds, but if they received 3 doses, vaccine effectiveness was boosted back up to 81%. Regardless, in both age groups, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization was relatively maintained at very high levels even after 150 days.\n\n【50】### Why Do Breakthrough Cases Occur?\n\n【51】Breakthrough cases are the predictable and expected result of a collision of waning immunity, new variants with immune-evading capability, high community burden of transmission, and inherent host factors as discussed here.\n\n【52】#### Booster Doses and the Wobble Stage\n\n【53】There is a theoretical construct vaccinologists use when thinking about delivering vaccines to a population in the context of an emerging pathogen for which there is no prior immunity. The main principles of this construct include the following:\n\n【54】*   •\n\n【55】    Building population-level immunity quickly. Unfortunately, we were not successful in doing that because of vaccine hesitancy and rejection.\n\n【56】*   •\n\n【57】    Rebuilding immunity as it wanes with time. Boosters are required, but even they will wane with time, and far fewer people received timely boosters.\n\n【58】*   •\n\n【59】    Eventually, as in the case of SARS-CoV-2 BA.4/5 and subvariants, a new variant develops that requires refocusing immunity to that viral variant with a variant-focused vaccine booster. This is the wobble stage that we are in right now.\n\n【60】#### Real-World Effectiveness Data\n\n【61】Individuals who received the primary Pfizer series and then were boosted barely accumulate any measurable risks of hospitalization, whereas those who received only 2 doses suffer from more hospitalizations. This is true for both severe disease and death.\n\n【62】Effectiveness of a third dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine for preventing severe outcomes in Israel: an observational study.\n\n【63】If we analyze homologous vs heterologous boosting, after the administration of 2 doses of Pfizer vaccine, there is waning of vaccine effectiveness against the Delta variant but much faster and significant waning of vaccine effectiveness against variants like Omicron. When we add a Pfizer booster dose, we get a profound boost in vaccine effectiveness that begins to wane quickly. On the other hand, when the booster dose is Moderna (heterologous boosting), effectiveness seems to be better. Thus, a “mix and match” strategy may offer some slight benefit.\n\n【64】Pfizer vaccine data in the elderly reveal a similar story.\n\n【65】Durability of omicron-neutralising serum activity after mRNA booster immunisation in older adults.\n\n【66】Measurable neutralizing ability was somewhat depressed for the Delta strain vs the Wuhan strain but profoundly depressed for Omicron. The neutralizing ability improves with boosting but wanes again and is more suppressed with Omicron compared with Delta and Wuhan. Moderna vaccine was also effective against infection after the second dose with waning over time, especially against Omicron. When boosted, effectiveness improves, but similarly more waning of immunity was observed with Omicron than with Delta.\n\n【67】Effectiveness of mRNA-1273 against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta variants.\n\n【68】There seems to be consistency across the vaccines, with slightly better neutralization capability of Moderna vs Pfizer. The major point is that allowing continued viral transmission in the population will continue to result in the development of variants that will “learn” how to evade immunity by means of mutation and recombination.\n\n【69】#### Vaccine Effectiveness Against Hospitalizations\n\n【70】During the Omicron-predominant period through January 2021, after 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine, effectiveness against infection fell dramatically after 5 months to the 50% range. However, with a third dose (booster dose 1), it goes back up into the 90% range but subsequently falls into the 80% range and continues to gradually wane with time. Thus, booster doses are critical in providing the maximum amount of protection against infection, hospitalization, severe disease, and death.\n\n【71】删除21:<u>Waning 2-dose and 3-dose effectiveness of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19–associated emergency department and urgent care encounters and hospitalizations among adults during periods of Delta and Omicron variant predominance—VISION Network, 10 states, August 2021–January 2022.</u>\n\n【72】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【73】### Vaccine Recommendations\n\n【74】As a result of the preceding, we have seen the evolution of recommendations for vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now allow that the second dose can be delayed up to 8 weeks after the first dose for those who are otherwise healthy and who are older than 12 years and younger than 65 years. The reason is that the longer the interval between doses, the better the immunogenicity and durability with reduced adverse effects. In fact, there is early evidence that we can decrease the already small risk of myocarditis by expanding that interval. The issue is that until 2 doses have been received, protection against disease is compromised. As for the Janssen vaccine, the most recent recommendation is to subsequently boost with an mRNA vaccine. In the immunocompromised host, 2 doses are given, with a later additional dose (third dose) followed by a booster dose (fourth dose) 2 or more months after the third dose. For nonimmunocompromised persons, a newer bivalent mRNA booster is available, as is a protein subunit vaccine for use as a booster 2 or more months after the last vaccine dose. These recommendations will continue to evolve as more data become available and with the advent of new boosters and new variants that threaten health, and the CDC vaccine guidance charts should be consulted.\n\n【75】### Vaccine Safety\n\n【76】It is important to communicate that there is no such thing as “safe” with any human-made product. There is only the balance between risk and benefit and therefore the concept of “safer.” Wisdom, then, resides in guiding patients in which risks to undertake for the most benefit as there is no risk-free pathway. There are only 4 choices: COVID-19 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, passive immunity, and absolute isolation. As the Janssen vaccine is no longer a preferred vaccine, here we primarily comment on the issue of myocarditis.\n\n【77】#### Myocarditis/Myopericarditis\n\n【78】The predominant risk discussed in the media due to COVID-19 vaccination is myopericarditis. There is relatively little risk of myocarditis/myopericarditis after the first dose regardless of which mRNA vaccine is administered. The second dose appears to be the issue, hence the recommendation of increasing the time interval between doses. There appears to be a greater risk with Moderna vaccine (probably because of dose) compared with Pfizer vaccine.\n\n【79】SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and myocarditis or myopericarditis: population based cohort study.\n\n【80】If we look at a 7-day risk interval per million doses given, we find that this is a male-predominant adverse effect that happens significantly less often in female patients. It is more common during the pubertal period but can still happen in older individuals but with much less frequency.\n\n【81】删除21:<u>Myocarditis cases reported after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination in the US from December 2020 to August 2021.</u>\n\n【82】Examining risks vs benefits reveals that if we administer 1 million doses of an mRNA vaccine to men aged 16 to 17 years, we prevent about 57,000 cases of COVID-19, 500 COVID-19–related hospitalizations, and 170 COVID-19–related intensive care unit admissions. The price we pay is 73 cases of vaccine-associated myocarditis.\n\n【83】If we examine the number of excess events due to vaccine exposure per million exposed, we find a significantly smaller number for myocarditis in those who received a dose or 2 doses of mRNA vaccines compared with myocarditis in those who became COVID-19 infected. When we look at pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias, it is almost always related to the infection.\n\n【84】Risks of myocarditis, pericarditis, and cardiac arrhythmias associated with COVID-19 vaccination or SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\n【85】As another example, the risk of myocarditis in patients with COVID-19 is about 16 times higher vs that in noninfected people. The myocarditis risk is 37 times higher for infected children younger than 16 years and 7 times higher for infected people aged 16 to 39 years compared with their uninfected peers.\n\n【86】删除21:<u>Association between COVID-19 and myocarditis using hospital-based administrative data—United States, March 2020–January 2021.</u>\n\n【87】Another example is the risk of thrombotic thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) in women (30- to 49-year age group) after receipt of the Janssen vaccine. Per million doses administered in this age group, we prevent 10,000 cases of COVID-19, 900 hospitalizations, 140 intensive care unit admissions, and 20 deaths. The price we pay is 6 to 7 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome and 8 to 10 cases of TTS.\n\n【88】删除21:<u>Use of COVID-19 vaccines after reports of adverse events among adult recipients of Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) and mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna): update from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices—United States, July 2021.</u>\n\n【89】Fortunately, we have other choices, like an mRNA vaccine, with which we can eliminate the risk of TTS. As a result, the CDC now recommends that an mRNA vaccine be used preferentially to the Janssen vaccine.\n\n【90】In summary, the new recommendation for mRNA vaccines to increase the interval between the first and second doses increases immunogenicity, decreases the risk of myocarditis, and improves antibody durability. This is tailored primarily toward healthy individuals 12 years and older and younger than 65 years but creates some degree of tension as there is not full protection until full immunization.\n\n【91】More recently, the Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of a protein nanoparticle platform vaccine (Novavax). This vaccine presents the spike protein and an adjuvant to the immune system with robust antibody formation. Longer term data are not yet available, nor are real-world effectiveness data in the face of evolving viral variants. Currently, the vaccine has been submitted for use as a booster, and the FDA has now approved this vaccine for use as a first booster.\n\n【92】### Multiorgan-Specific Subclinical Function\n\n【93】There are other highly significant risks of COVID-19 infection. The data to date reveal an alarming rate and breadth of end-organ long COVID complications and mental health issues.\n\n【94】In 1 study of 443 individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection, there were multiple abnormal organ-specific findings that persisted 6 to 9 months after mild to moderate infection.\n\n【95】Multi-organ assessment in mainly non-hospitalized individuals after SARS-CoV-2 infection: the Hamburg City Health Study COVID programme.\n\n【96】Another study reported large numbers of SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in the respiratory tract but also in the cardiovascular system, lymph nodes, skeletal muscle, nerves, ocular tissue, optic nerve, and brain. Autopsies revealed SARS-CoV-2 protein expression in human cerebellum and Purkinje system in addition to blood vessels in the brain.\n\n【97】Another study looked at risks and 12-month burdens of incident post–acute COVID-19 cardiovascular outcomes. Here again, regardless of age, COVID severity, and comorbidities, there was a profound excess risk burden per 1000 people of 20 different cardiovascular outcomes with a hazard ratio in the range of 2 to 4 for stroke, transient ischemic attack, arrhythmia, myocarditis, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and thrombotic disorders.\n\n【98】Finally, 1 study looked at mental health outcomes, particularly for those who were hospitalized with COVID-19, and found an elevated relative risk of a subsequent mental health diagnosis or mental health–related drug prescription.\n\n【99】More recently, a CDC study revealed evidence of long COVID symptoms in 20% to 25% of all COVID-19 cases.\n\n【100】删除21:<u>Post–COVID-19 conditions among adult COVID-19 survivors aged 18-64 and ≥65 years—United States, March 2020–November 2021.</u>\n\n【101】To date, the nature of postinfection symptoms remains unclear and is also associated with a variety of infections beyond COVID-19.\n\n【102】Glimmers of Hope and What Happens Next\n--------------------------------------\n\n【103】The question we are most often asked is, Are we heading into the endemic phase? There is no way to know. We believe that less severe variants may indicate movement into endemicity; however, to date, there is no evidence for this. In addition, we do not understand the biologic, virologic, and immunologic “rules” by which viruses become endemic with one exception: high levels of immunity in the population have a “forcing” action toward endemicity in general; but if immunity is not high enough, it can also act as a mutational pressure.\n\n【104】Unfortunately, because of how we failed to deal with the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 cannot now be eradicated. The multitude of reasons for this include human behavior and continued transmission, an animal reservoir (white-tailed deer, mink), waning immunity (both illness and vaccine induced), and importantly, continued viral mutation and recombination events. Therefore, we can confidently predict that our great-, great-, great-grandchildren will be getting COVID vaccines.\n\n【105】### Anticipations\n\n【106】What shall we expect in the future? One scenario is that SARS-CoV-2, under mutational and selective pressure and recombination events, further changes, allowing either significantly or somewhat enhanced transmissibility and virulence. The evidence for this is the observation of the continued generation of VOCs, such as BA.2.12, BA.2.12.1, BA.2.75.2, and BA.4/5, and their subvariants; insufficient immunogenicity of the current vaccines against variants with greater antigenic distance, such as Omicron and Omicron subvariants; continued rejection of current vaccines; and escape from monoclonal antibody, convalescent plasma, and vaccine-induced antibodies.\n\n【107】The second scenario is that SARS-CoV-2 mutates into a virus with significantly less transmissibility and virulence, allowing movement into the endemic phase, probably with periodic epidemic seasons. The evidence for this is currently lacking. There is no evidence for less transmissibility, and whereas the virulence of Omicron may be less in those previously vaccinated, that is not true for those who are unvaccinated.\n\n【108】### Next-Generation Vaccines\n\n【109】New COVID-19 vaccine development continues. Second-generation vaccines will likely be reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration during 2022 and into early 2023. The first of these, Novavax (recombinant S protein in a synthetic nanoparticle + Matrix-M), has already been approved. This is likely to be followed by vaccines being developed by Medicago (recombinant S protein VLP + AS03) and Sanofi/GSK (S protein produced in insect cells through baculovirus vector + AS03). So-called third-generation COVID vaccines may include oral and nasal spray formulations, peptide-based vaccines, and other novel formulations. Such vaccines offer the hope of inducing mucosal immunity, thereby blocking viral transmission and infection.\n\n【110】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【111】Finally, there is a significant likelihood of a worsening pandemic surge that the world will not be capable of mitigating in the face of the currently developing ultratransmissible Omicron subvariants. We must consider that SARS-CoV-2 is _controllable_ with proper masking and distancing. If we add vaccines, it is eminently controllable. Yet in the third decade of the 21st century, with more scientific/medical knowledge and resources than at any time in our history, we have generally proven ourselves incapable, nationally and globally, of responding in a _consistently_ rational manner. The evidence is overwhelming. Finally, over the horizon, areas of concern include unusual SARS-CoV-2 cryptic sequences that have been identified in New York City wastewater, early evidence of reverse zoonosis, and continued emergence of a variety of yet newer variants. We are also just starting to see the emergence and impact of the long-term population health effects of COVID-19 infection, including long COVID, predisposition to chronic illnesses, neuropsychiatric and behavioral/learning disabilities, and others that are yet to be recognized. The World Health Organization concluded in 2019 that vaccine hesitancy is one of the top 10 health threats to humans (that has turned out to be true), and wisdom dictates that unless we change our course of action, we will repeatedly see new variants that will drive continuing morbidity, mortality, and surge demands on the medical system. Such a course is untenable and immoral, given the profound suffering, morbidity, mortality, and effect on economies worldwide. Have we finally learned our lesson, or is it true that humankind never learns anything from history?\n\n【112】Potential Competing Interests\n-----------------------------\n\n【113】Dr. Poland is the chair of a Safety Evaluation Committee for novel investigational vaccine trials being conducted by Merck Research Laboratories.

Excluded were patients with syndromic AVM, previous SRS or embolization, and patients treated with volume-staged SRS. Biological effective dose was calculated using a mono-exponential model described by Jones and Hopewell. The primary outcome was likelihood of total obliteration defined by digital subtraction angiography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Variables were analyzed as continuous and dichotomous variables based on the maximum value of (sensitivity–\\[1–specificity\\]).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】This study included 352 patients (360 AVM, median follow-up, 5.9 years). The median margin dose prescribed was 18.75 Gy (interquartile range \\[IQR\\]: 18 to 20 Gy). Two hundred fifty-nine patients (71.9%) had obliteration shown by angiography (n=176) or MRI (n=83) at a median of 36 months after SRS (IQR: 26 to 44 months). Higher BED was associated with increased likelihood of obliteration in univariate Cox regression analyses, when treated as either a dichotomous (≥133 Gy; hazard ratio \\[HR\\],1.52; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.19 to 1.95; _P_ <.001) or continuous variable (HR, 1.00, 95% CI, 1.0002 to 1.005; _P_ \\=.04). In multivariable analyses including dichotomized BED and location, BED remained associated with obliteration ( _P_ \\=.001).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Biological effective dose ≥133 Gy was predictive of AVM obliteration after single-session SRS within the prescribed margin dose range 15 to 25 Gy.

Elderly persons are more susceptible to the effects of various medications for a number of reasons. It is well known that polypharmacy is one of the most serious problems in caring for elderly persons; however, many of these patients continue to receive medications that have an increased risk of causing harm. In 1991, an important article was published about inappropriate medication use in the elderly population. This article raised awareness of the problem and presented explicit criteria for determining which medications were inappropriate for elderly patients residing in long-term care facilities. This list of drugs is still used for evaluating medications taken by elderly persons and for determining whether satisfactory prescribing practices are being used. We reviewed the medications described as inappropriate for elderly persons and searched the scientific literature to determine whether evidence exists to defend or refute the labeling of particular drugs.

L.E.H.) designed an ambulatory clinic specifically to care for patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). None of the hundreds of research reports published to date addressed caring for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the ambulatory setting, and it became clear that one of the first challenges we faced was to gain an understanding of the typical presentation and early natural history of mild and moderate COVID-19 to guide our care during the pandemic.\n\n【1】While we had access to state laboratory real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2, concerns regarding false-negative results and delays of up to 5 days made the results impractical for clinical management. Routine laboratory studies, likewise, did not appear to be clinically useful. We focused, instead, on trying to discern patterns from a detailed history and limited physical exam that might distinguish COVID-19 from other similar illnesses.\n\n【2】Initially, some cases of COVID-19 appeared to be identical to influenza, upper respiratory tract, lower respiratory tract infections, gastroenteritis, and community-acquired pneumonia. After caring for more than 1000 patients in our COVID-19 clinic, however, we came to suspect that many moderate and severe cases of COVID-19 could be diagnosed by a careful history.\n\n【3】At the outset, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may be asymptomatic or experience symptoms indistinguishable from a variety of acute viral and bacterial infections. In a retrospective study of 191 patients admitted to two hospitals in Wuhan, China, the initial several days of SARS-CoV-2 infection involved fever (94%) and cough (79%).\n\n【4】Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.\n\n【5】However, these presentations were likely biased by being only those of hospitalized patients, and hospital admission was often predicated on testing positive for COVID-19 in an ambulatory “fever clinic.” Referral to a fever clinic in Wuhan, China, required the presence of both fever and at least one respiratory symptom, likely limiting the spectrum of disease described in these and other early studies, for example, by excluding patients with predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【6】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【7】Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of 99 cases of 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia in Wuhan, China: a descriptive study.\n\n【8】In our clinic, patients with various combinations of mild symptoms, including nasal congestion, cough, sore throat, pleuritic chest pain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, myalgias, back pain, and fatigue have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. We have also cared for many patients who experienced severe symptoms, including fever, cough, myalgias, and exhaustion, during the initial days of infection. Fever is common, but temperature elevations can be mild, particularly at the outset of illness.\n\n【9】Clinical features of patients infected with 2019 novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China.\n\n【10】One of the only early hints to the diagnosis is loss of smell\n\n【11】Sudden and complete olfactory loss function as a possible symptom of COVID-19 删除20:<u>\\[published online ahead of print April 8, 2020\\]</u>.\n\n【12】which many of our patients report losing during the first few days of illness. These initial days of SARS-CoV-2 infection are often indistinguishable from many common illnesses.\n\n【13】Although many patients will recover from their initial symptoms over the course of 2 to 3 weeks, for a sizable proportion of patients, their clinical course worsens, with dyspnea setting in typically between day 4 and day 10 of illness. We have also seen some patients in whom dyspnea first develops more than 14 days after the onset of symptoms. In the absense of diagnostic testing, the onset of dyspnea is the point at which COVID-19 can begin to be discerned from other common illnesses.\n\n【14】Some patients who develop dyspnea progress to critical illness. Others have a stable, persistent course that spontaneously resolves after several days or weeks and, in our clinical experience, can often be safely managed at home. We have found these first days after the onset of dyspnea to be critical for monitoring patients frequently by televisits or in-person evaluations. The most useful factors to monitor are work of breathing and oxygen saturation. Oxygen saturation often decreases precipitously with exertion, even in some previously healthy patients. Similar to published observations, several clinical factors appear to predict clinical worsening in our experience, including older age, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and hypertension.\n\n【15】Risk factors associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 pneumonia in Wuhan, China 删除20:<u>\\[published online ahead of print March 13, 2020\\]</u>.\n\n【16】Among our patients, essential workers, particarly recent immigrants from Central America who live in close quarters with multiple people, are at risk of disease progression.\n\n【17】Distinguishing COVID-19 from other serious treatable conditions is essential. Community-acquired pneumonia, especially with atypical organisms such as _Legionella_ , may present similarly to COVID-19.\n\n【18】There may be some clues, however, that can assist clinicians in distinguishing the two diagnoses. The classic progression of _Legionella_ pneumonia initially begins with fever and fatigue, followed by cough shortly thereafter — dyspnea would only be expected in cases in which the pneumonia progressed to become more severe. In contrast, in patients with COVID-19 we often see the appearance of cough and fever at the onset with dyspnea occurring a few days later, sometimes even after the fever has abated.\n\n【19】Clinically, COVID-19 respiratory symptoms appear to be most similar to those caused by _Pneumocystis jirovecii_ pneumonia, a pulmonary infection predominantly affecting the alveoli. We have found that, similar to _Pneumocystis_ pneumonia, a precipitous decrease in oxygen saturation level with exertion is highly suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In the case of _Pneumocysitis_ pneumonia, however, the dyspnea typically develops insidiously over weeks, not days.\n\n【20】Post-viral pneumonia also has many similarities to COVID-19, but might be distinguishable in some cases by a careful history. Cough and fatigue may be the initial presentation in both, but the next stage is different. Whereas increasing fever and productive cough might be symptoms of post-viral pneumonia, in COVID-19 we typically note worsening dyspnea without productive cough.\n\n【21】Similarly, during the initial days of infection, both influenza and COVID-19 may have identical presentations, but thereafter the progression of the two infections diverges. In uncomplicated influenza, it would be unusual to develop the onset of dyspnea 4 to 10 days after symptoms began. Whereas patients with influenza may develop mild dyspnea, we would expect the dyspnea to improve gradually over the following days or weeks with an uncomplicated influenza infection. In addition, patients with rare viral pneumonia from influenza tend to deteriorate rapidly within the first 2 to 3 days of infection, unlike patients with COVID-19 who do not tend to deteriorate until later in their course of illness.\n\n【22】COVID-19 can also present similarly to streptococcal pharyngitis, viral sinusitis, acute pericarditis, and other common infections, but in each case, the key distinction is the development of dyspnea several days after the onset of infection, even as the other symptoms may be improving.\n\n【23】Given the extensive media attention regarding the serious consequences of COVID-19, there is an understandably high level of anxiety in the community. One common cause of shortness of breath in our clinic has been anxiety combined with viral-type symptoms. Key aspects of anxiety-induced shortness of breath that have helped us distinguish anxiety-induced dyspnea from SARS-CoV-2–induced dyspnea are found at the onset: with anxiety, onset is often immediately after the first symptoms of infection, whereas with SARS-CoV-2, dyspnea occurs several days after the initial symptoms begin. The description of dyspnea is often helpful as well. In our patients with dyspnea due to anxiety, the dyspnea tends to occur at rest or when trying to fall asleep but does not become more pronounced when participating in daily activities. Patients with anxiety often describe the sensation of not being able to get enough air into their lungs, whereas with SARS-CoV-2 infection, dyspnea is consistently worse with exertion. Although dizziness might occur in both conditions, it too is more likely to be present at rest with anxiety and with exertion in COVID-19. When a pulse oximeter is available, a normal oxygen saturation level with ambulation helps confirm one’s clinical suspicion of anxiety-related shortness of breath.\n\n【24】Because current treatment options for COVID-19 are limited, we pay particular attention to identifying treatable etiologies of dyspnea including exacerbations of underlying pulmonary and cardiovascular disease and treat the exacerbation as we would have before the pandemic.\n\n【25】The typical COVID-19 pattern of a nonspecific viral syndrome — often involving the respiratory system but not infrequently the gastrointestinal system — followed by onset of dyspnea several days later, particularly with precipitous decreases in oxygen saturation level especially with exertion, are helpful keys to distinguishing COVID-19 from other similar conditions. A nuanced understanding of the typical presentation and natural history of COVID-19 in the ambulatory setting can help determine the appropriate timing of follow-up — patients who have begun to develop dyspnea should be followed closely in the following 72 hours for evidence of worsening dyspnea particularly with exertion — and permit clinicians to more easily distinguish COVID-19 from other common and treatable illnesses.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:33:56", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:35:05", "cost": 68.157}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:32", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:35:05", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:33:56"}

Six-month, 1-year, and 2-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival free of death/MI/CABG/target vessel revascularization were 84%, 77%, and 69%, respectively, for group 2 and were significantly worse compared with group 1 (89%, 85%, and 80%, respectively; _P_ <.001).

On follow-up, the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with PAD were worse, with higher mortality, MI, and need for repeated target vessel revascularization.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】BARI ( Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation ), CABG ( coronary artery bypass grafting ), CHF ( congestive heart failure ), CI ( confidence interval ), IC ( intracoronary ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), OR ( odds ratio ), PAD ( peripheral arterial disease ), PCI ( percutaneous coronary intervention ), PTCA ( percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 09:50:02", "endTime": "2024/08/27 09:51:17", "cost": 75.31}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:32", "update_time": "2024-08-26 17:51:15", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 17:49:59"}

There are 3 important features of this successful outcome that merit further discussion: timing of intervention, cannula selection, and duration of support.\n\n【9】Early recognition of RV failure–mediated cardiogenic shock is arguably the most significant opportunity for improving survival in the cardiovascular intensive care unit. Nevertheless, this diagnosis is easy to miss and frequently occurs in the clinical context of distributive features or left ventricular dysfunction. For this reason, it is often tempting to attribute end-organ malperfusion to these more easily recognized conditions and miss an opportunity for recovery. Discussions around the institution of continuous renal replacement therapy can serve as an important warning sign and an opportunity to pause and consider the need for mechanical circulatory support. The use of a pulmonary artery catheter is essential in making this determination, and documentation of a pulmonary artery pulsatility index below 1.0 in the setting of end-organ dysfunction should prompt an activation of the shock team to assess the need for escalation. Although this approach seems straightforward in theory, it can often be difficult to implement in practice, and the authors are to be congratulated for the alacrity with which they responded to this patient’s acute deterioration.\n\n【10】Whereas the massive RV dilation described in this case report represents an extreme scenario, the pitfalls associated with percutaneous access to the pulmonary artery should be familiar to all proceduralists. Cannula length is extremely important in planning an intervention, and these can range from 46 cm in the 29F Protek Duo (LivaNova) to 64.8 cm in the 17F Bio-Medicus NextGen femoral venous cannula (Medtronic). Based on personal experience and communication with fellow members of the TandemHeart Experiences and Methods (THEME) steering committee, I have abandoned the use of the shorter 29F Protek Duo cannula in favor of the 31F cannula because many patients require the additional 5 cm in length for optimal placement to be achieved in the main pulmonary artery. This invariably predisposes smaller patients to a higher risk of superior vena cava obstruction, but thankfully venous decompression through secondary cannulation of the subclavian vein (17F) can eliminate this complication. Rapid return of renal function is expected after the institution of percutaneous RV assist device (RVAD) support, and failure to achieve this warrants consideration of inadequate inferior vena cava decompression. Here again, decompression through femoral venous cannulation (17F) can optimize organ recovery, albeit at the expense of limiting ambulation options during the patient’s rehabilitation.\n\n【11】Perhaps one of the most important advantages of percutaneous over open RVAD insertion techniques involves the ability to sustain long periods of support, allowing greater rehabilitation and recovery. This is due to the fact that removal can occur through manual pressure at the bedside rather than in the setting of a redo sternotomy in the operating room. Certainly, a strategy that favors longer time on support must balance the benefits of ongoing end-organ recovery with the risks of device-specific complications. Among these, cannula displacement into the RV represents one of the more challenging impediments to a successful outcome in that attempts at repositioning are rarely successful. Careful positioning of the distal lumen during insertion represents the best opportunity for prevention of this complication. Unlike percutaneous left ventricular support platforms that depend heavily on the transesophageal echocardiographic assessment for optimal placement, positioning of a dual-lumen percutaneous RVAD can typically be achieved with fluoroscopic imaging alone during insertion. Ideally, the Lunderquist wire (Cook Medical) is maintained with the tip in the right pulmonary artery in the midclavicular line. The dual-lumen cannula is then advanced over the wire until the distal lumen can be seen advancing into the right pulmonary artery (well beyond the desired end point). This maneuver having been completed, the wire and stylet can be removed in their entirety. Under careful fluoroscopic monitoring, the cannula is then slowly pulled back until it snaps into an upright position, indicating optimal placement in the main pulmonary artery. Further manipulation at this point is ill advised, given that it is always easier to pull the cannula back later than to readvance it in the rare event that malposition occurs. Subsequent imaging attempts by echocardiography, computed tomography, or fluoroscopy are often less reliable than the dynamic movement of the cannula during initial pullback in providing confirmation of optimal placement in the distal main pulmonary artery.\n\n【12】In many ways, Ebstein anomaly can be viewed as the last battle in a variety of conditions that routinely plague the cardiovascular specialist through the progression of RV dysfunction to cardiogenic shock. Whereas percutaneous RVAD support has unlocked new opportunities in the management of such diverse entities as postcardiotomy shock,\n\n【13】A dual-lumen percutaneous cannula for managing refractory right ventricular failure.\n\n【14】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【15】Peripherally inserted concomitant surgical right and left ventricular support, the Propella, is associated with low rates of limb ischemia, with mortality comparable with peripheral venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n\n【16】acute pulmonary embolism,\n\n【17】chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension,\n\n【18】Minimally invasive mechanical circulatory support through the perioperative pulmonary thromboendarterectomy period: a case report.\n\n【19】primary graft failure after lung transplant, and acute respiratory distress syndrome in the setting of COVID-19,\n\n【20】Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with right ventricular assist device for COVID-19 ARDS.\n\n【21】the technical obstacles presented in this case represent the pinnacle of procedural complexity.

The Revised International Prognostic Scoring System and other risk models were applied for risk stratification. Separate analyses were conducted for patients diagnosed before 2005 (n=531) and after 2005 (n=469).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Eighty-five percent of patients were older than 60 years (median age, 72 years), with 69% being men. The median follow-up period was 27 months (range, 0-300 months), during which time 808 (81%) deaths and 129 (13%) leukemic transformations were documented.

Revised International Prognostic Scoring System risk distribution was similar in patients diagnosed before or after 2005 ( _P_ \\=.23): 17% were categorized as very low, 36% low, 21% intermediate, 15% high, and 11% very high risk, with a median survival of 72, 43, 24, 18, and 7 months, respectively ( _P_ <.001).

He also described a new, painless numbness and tingling in his fingertips bilaterally.\n\n【1】The patient denied any history of chest pain, syncope, palpitations, muscle weakness, incontinence, weight changes, or recent illness. He was taking no prescription or over-the-counter medications or food supplements. He had no other relevant medical or surgical history. He had never used tobacco or illicit drugs and consumed an average of 1 alcoholic beverage per month. He had no siblings. Family history was remarkable for coronary artery disease in his father and osteoarthritis in his mother.\n\n【2】Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 101/58 mm Hg, with a regular pulse of 86 beats/min. The patient was afebrile, alert, and well nourished. Head and neck evaluation demonstrated a supple neck without tenderness to palpation or carotid bruits. Scleras were normal. Neck range of motion and strength were normal. Findings on thyroid and lymph node examinations were unremarkable. Cardiac examination revealed normal first and second heart sounds without murmurs, gallops, or rubs. Lung sounds were clear. The patient's skin was pale. Abdominal examination revealed no tenderness, masses, or hepatosplenomegaly. Cranial nerve examination revealed no abnormalities in cranial nerves II through XII. Sensation was intact throughout, except for reduced pinpoint discrimination of the bilateral finger tips. The Phalen maneuver and Tinel sign were negative. The extremities, including the thenar musculature, were of normal tone, bulk, and strength, with symmetric and normal reflexes throughout.

His shortness of breath, fatigue, and paresthesia can be related to a wide spectrum of cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, or metabolic diseases.\n\n【16】Carpal tunnel syndrome may cause the paresthesia but in the median nerve distribution. Advanced cases may demonstrate a positive Phalen maneuver, Tinel sign, and thenar muscle atrophy. Our patient does not have any of these signs. This diagnosis would not explain his shortness of breath. His bilateral symptoms are possible but do not classically occur in median nerve entrapment.\n\n【17】Cervical disc impingement may cause symmetric paresthesias. However, the patient had unremarkable findings on neurologic examination except for sensation, no recent history of trauma or osteoarthritis, and no other pertinent history or examination findings indicating impingement. This diagnosis would not explain the patient's shortness of breath or fatigue.\n\n【18】Anemia is consistent with the patient's shortness of breath and fatigue, and certain types of anemia can be associated with paresthesia. Therefore, anemia is the most likely diagnosis on the given differential diagnosis. Shortness of breath can occur with angina. However, this patient does not have any chest pain or relevant personal or family cardiac history. Angina would also not explain his paresthesia.\n\n【19】Multiple sclerosis can present with fatigue, and a variety of neurologic symptoms including paresthesia may be associated. It occurs more often in women, with a typical age of onset of 20 to 40 years. Episodes can last for days, weeks, or months. Although multiple sclerosis is a reasonable consideration, the patient's dyspnea, pallor on examination, and lack of other neurologic findings suggest that anemia is more likely.\n\n【20】The patient's complete blood cell count (CBC) was remarkable for the following (reference ranges provided parenthetically): white blood cell count, 2.3 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L (3.5-10.5 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L); hemoglobin level, 5.1 g/dL (13.5-17.5 g/dL); mean corpuscular volume, 119 fL (81.2-95.1 fL); and platelets, 77 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L (150-450 × 10 删除19:<u><sup>9 </sup></u> /L). His electrolyte panel yielded the following unremarkable findings: sodium, 141 mEq/L (135-145 mEq/L); potassium, 4.3 mmol/L (3.6-4.8 mmol/L); creatinine, 0.9 mg/dL (0.9-1.4 mg/dL); and glucose, 92 mg/dL (70-100 mg/dL). His thyroid panel was normal. The patient's levels of C-reactive protein and creatine kinase as well as his sedimentation rate were all within normal limits.

The differential diagnosis of macrocytosis is broad and outlined in the Table . It includes myelodysplastic syndromes, drugs (including chemotherapeutic agents) that affect or block DNA metabolism, and folate and vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiencies, all of which may be characterized by oval macrocytes on the peripheral smear. The differential diagnosis also includes alcohol abuse, hypothyroidism, and liver disease, which can be associated with round macrocytes. The peripheral smear in macrocytosis may also demonstrate the regenerative macrocytosis seen with reticulocytosis.\n\n【34】TABLE Differential Diagnosis of Macrocytosis\n\n| DNA metabolism abnormalitiesVitamin B 12 deficiencyFolate deficiencyDrugs (including chemotherapeutic agents) that affect or block DNA metabolism (eg, methotrexate, azathioprine, hydroxyurea)Lipid abnormalitiesHypothyroidismLiver diseaseBone marrow disordersMyelodysplastic syndromesLarge granular lymphocytic leukemiaOtherAlcoholismMultiple myelomaReticulocytosisFanconi anemia |\n| --- |\n\n【36】Anemias due to vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> or folate deficiency, chemotherapeutic agents, or myelodysplasia are commonly the result of impaired DNA synthesis and are typically characterized by large immature red blood cells and hypersegmented neutrophils.\n\n【37】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【38】Although a bone marrow biopsy may reveal a primary bone marrow disorder, less invasive measures should be considered first.\n\n【39】Folate and vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency both can lead to macrocytic anemia. Because of the corresponding paresthesias known to occur with vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency and not with folate deficiency, checking a vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> level is most useful during this point of the evaluation.\n\n【40】The MMA and homocysteine levels are used to confirm the diagnosis of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency, especially in the setting of concurrent folate deficiency. In vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency, the MMA and homocysteine levels are both elevated. Only the homocysteine level is elevated in folate deficiency. Before testing these levels, however, it will be most useful to check the vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> level in this patient.\n\n【41】Our patient's blood tests revealed a markedly low vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> level of less than 70 ng/L (180-914 ng/L). His diagnosis was confirmed with an elevated MMA level of 46 μmol/L (≤0.40 μmol/L). His folate level was normal. A peripheral blood smear showed oval macrocytes, marked anisocytosis, marked polychromasia, slight poikilocytosis, and occasional dacrocyte tailed blood cells. Intrinsic factor antibodies were positive, and a polyspecific direct antiglobulin test yielded negative results.\n\n【42】*   3.\n\n【43】    **_On the basis of these test results, which one of the following is the most likely etiology of the patient's anemia?_**\n\n【44】    *   a.\n\n【45】        _Malabsorption_\n\n【46】    *   b.\n\n【47】        _Pernicious anemia_\n\n【48】    *   c.\n\n【49】        _Achlorhydria_\n\n【50】    *   d.\n\n【51】        _Dietary insufficiency_\n\n【52】    *   e.\n\n【53】        _Diphyllobothrium latum_\n\n【54】When vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> is ingested, it initially binds to protein carriers. The acidic environment in the stomach then causes it to dissociate from the protein carriers. Intrinsic factor is manufactured by the parietal and zymogenic cells in the gastric fundus and body and binds to the free vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> in the duodenum. This complex travels through the intestines and is absorbed by receptors in the terminal ileum. Dysfunction during any part of this process can lead to total body vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency.\n\n【55】Malabsorption of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> can occur specifically in patients who have lost their ileal receptors, such as those with inflammatory bowel disease or those whose terminal ileum has been surgically removed. Our patient does not have this history.\n\n【56】Pernicious anemia results when the autoimmune destruction of the gastric parietal and zymogenic cells inhibits intrinsic factor production. Intrinsic factor antibodies may also be present and bind to existing intrinsic factor. Our patient's undetectable vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> levels, elevated MMA level, and positive intrinsic factor antibodies make pernicious anemia the most likely diagnosis.\n\n【57】Achlorhydria, or lack of acid in the stomach, can also lead to vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency. If the environment in the stomach is not acidic, the vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> and protein carrier complex does not dissociate, and intrinsic factor is unable to bind to vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> . Such is the case in patients taking medications that inhibit acid production (eg, proton pump inhibitors). Achlorhydria can also be secondary to aging, and vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency is seen frequently in elderly patients. This etiology was unlikely in our patient who was not elderly and was not taking medications that inhibited acid production.\n\n【58】Dietary insufficiency is rare but can occur. _D latum_ (fish tapeworm) and other biological competition (eg, bacterial overgrowth syndromes) can lead to vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiencies.\n\n【59】Humans are the definitive hosts for _D latum_ and can be infected by consuming undercooked fish, including walleye and pike.\n\n【60】Nothing in this patient's history suggests any of these processes.\n\n【61】The patient was informed of his diagnosis. In discussing the diagnosis with his family, the patient learned that his father required vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> supplementation to compensate for a vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency.\n\n【62】*   4.\n\n【63】    **_Which one of the following would be the best treatment for this patient's condition?_**\n\n【64】    *   a.\n\n【65】        _Packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion_\n\n【66】    *   b.\n\n【67】        _Intramuscular vitamin B12 and PRBC transfusion_\n\n【68】    *   c.\n\n【69】        _Intravenous vitamin B12 and PRBC transfusion_\n\n【70】    *   d.\n\n【71】        _Omeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and PRBC transfusion_\n\n【72】    *   e.\n\n【73】        _Omeprazole, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, vitamin B12, and PRBC transfusion_\n\n【74】Given the patient's symptoms of dyspnea and low hemoglobin level, it is appropriate to treat with PRBCs. It is also important to initiate vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> therapy to treat his deficiency and neurologic symptoms. Vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> is available in oral, intramuscular, and intranasal forms. Vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> is also compatible in intravenous solutions of normal saline but is not easily administered. Treatment with both PRBCs and intramuscular vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> is preferred. Adding the omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin treatment would be appropriate if the patient were positive for _Helicobacter pylori. H pylori_ may lead to vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency by causing atrophic gastritis.\n\n【75】_Helicobacter pylori_ —is it a novel causative agent in Vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency?\n\n【76】However, no information on _H pylori_ status was available for this patient, and he had known intrinsic factor antibodies that explained his anemia.\n\n【77】This patient was treated with a transfusion of PRBCs. He also received 1000 μg of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> intramuscularly daily for 1 week, then weekly for 1 month, and then monthly indefinitely.\n\n【78】*   5.\n\n【79】    **_Which one of the following is the most appropriate study to order during follow-up testing?_**\n\n【80】    *   a.\n\n【81】        _Hemoglobin assay_\n\n【82】    *   b.\n\n【83】        _Hemoglobin and potassium assay_\n\n【84】    *   c.\n\n【85】        _CBC_\n\n【86】    *   d.\n\n【87】        _CBC and potassium assay_\n\n【88】    *   e.\n\n【89】        _CBC and potassium and creatinine assays_\n\n【90】Follow-up should include a hemoglobin assay to determine the patient's response to treatment. His bone marrow may respond to the high loads of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> with a sudden increase in erythropoiesis. Therefore, a CBC is necessary in addition to a hemoglobin assay, especially to monitor platelets. Aspirin can be administered if the platelet levels increase above normal limits.\n\n【91】The potassium level should be monitored because potassium is consumed during erythropoiesis, and its rapid consumption could lead to life-threatening hypokalemia. A creatinine assay is not indicated. Therefore, the most appropriate follow-up studies are a CBC and a potassium assay.\n\n【92】Follow-up CBC was unremarkable, with all values within normal limits. The patient tested negative for the _H pylori_ antibody. He had hypergastrinemia (gastrin level, 1102 pg/mL \\[<100 pg/mL\\]), and benign findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy. After initiation of treatment, the patient's symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, and paresthesia entirely resolved. He will require lifelong vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> supplementation.\n\n【93】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【94】Patients with vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency often first present to the primary care physician. Because these patients are at risk of long-term neurologic deficits, it is critical that physicians be able to diagnose a vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency. Promptly diagnosing and treating a vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency may even reverse ongoing neurologic changes.\n\n【95】Folic acid deficiency may lead to a megaloblastic anemia similar to that caused by a lack of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> . Replacement of folic acid alone may correct the anemia but can mask a concurrent vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency. Folic acid supplementation will not prevent the progression of neurologic symptoms.\n\n【96】Of note, patients with vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency may present with neurologic symptoms without a corresponding anemia. Our patient had a pancytopenia, which can be seen in advanced cases of pernicious anemia. However, the severity of leukopenia and thrombocytopenia can vary among patients.\n\n【97】The vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> level may be falsely normal in patients with liver disease, myeloproliferative diseases, and long-term nitrous oxide exposure or abuse. If vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> levels are normal but the diagnosis is strongly suspected, the MMA and homocysteine levels should be checked to confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【98】Hypergastrinemia in patients with pernicious anemia can lead to enterochromaffin cell hyperplasia and gastric carcinoid tumors. As many as 1% to 7% of patients with pernicious anemia develop gastric carcinoid tumors that may be identified via esophagogastroduodenoscopy.\n\n【99】Patients with pernicious anemia are also estimated to have a 3- to 5-fold higher risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma compared with the general population. Colorectal cancers may also be more frequent.\n\n【100】However, no formal recommendations are available regarding the frequency of monitoring.\n\n【101】Fortunately, our patient's paresthesias resolved with adequate vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> supplementation. Nonetheless, approximately 50% of patients have residual neurologic disease despite treatment.\n\n【102】In pernicious anemia patients with neurologic symptoms, the use of intramuscular vs oral vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> remains a subject of debate. Studies suggest that vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> is equally effective when taken orally (in a high dose daily) as when administered via the intramuscular route,\n\n【103】Oral vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> versus intramuscular vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> for vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency: a systemic review of randomized controlled trials.\n\n【104】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【105】Oral versus intramuscular cobalamin treatment in megaloblastic anemia: a single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label study.\n\n【106】because passive diffusion of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> accounts for 1% to 2% of total absorption and is unaffected in patients with pernicious anemia. However, these studies are limited, and further research is indicated.\n\n【107】In summary, early recognition and treatment of vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency can resolve anemia and prevent and potentially reverse any neurologic sequelae.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:34:57", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:36:56", "cost": 118.653}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:32", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:36:56", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:34:57"}

A network meta-analysis using both frequentist and Bayesian methods was performed to analyze VTE recurrence and major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified 3 randomized controlled trials, at low risk of bias, that enrolled 1739 patients with cancer-associated VTE. Direct comparison revealed a lower rate of VTE recurrence in DOAC compared with dalteparin groups (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 0.48; 95% CI, 0.24-0.96; _I_ 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> \\=46%). Indirect comparison suggested that apixaban had greater reduction in VTE recurrence compared with dalteparin (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.82) but not rivaroxaban or edoxaban. Apixaban also had the highest probability of being ranked most effective. By direct comparisons, there was an increased likelihood of major bleeding in the DOAC group compared with dalteparin (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.04-2.78). Clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding did not differ. Indirect estimates were imprecise. Subgroup analyses in gastrointestinal cancers suggested that dalteparin may have the lowest risk of bleeding, whereas estimates in urothelial cancer were imprecise.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Direct oral anticoagulants appear to lower the risk of VTE recurrence compared with dalteparin while increasing major bleeding.

As people spend the majority of their time indoors, the quality of the indoor environment has a major impact on overall health.

These relationships are critically important for predicting infection growth rates and to counsel people on possible home interventions that could be deployed to mitigate viral transmission.\n\n【9】The purpose of this perspective is to discuss concisely the association between virus transmission and the indoor environment. We will focus on data pertaining to temperature and humidity and comment on implications for current practice and future research.\n\n【10】Environmental Factors and Viral Transmission\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Environmental factors—such as temperature, humidity, and ventilation—play a role in the persistence, infectivity, and dispersal and removal of viruses and can alter human defense mechanisms that protect against respiratory pathogens.\n\n【12】Animal experiments have demonstrated a link between temperature and relative humidity and viral transmission, with a greater persistence and infectivity of influenza A virus at cold temperatures and low relative humidity.\n\n【13】Although the relationship between environmental factors and transmission of virus are multifaceted, several factors—likely operating in combination—have been evoked including reduction of mucociliary clearance by desiccation of upper airways, increased stability of viruses with a lipid envelope in dry air, and impact of relative humidity on droplet dynamics.\n\n【14】Cold temperature and low relative humidity are also believed to increase the transmission of other respiratory viruses, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus, and avian influenza virus.\n\n【15】A recent systematic analysis of 37,335 studies reported on seasonal patterns among 4 viruses: influenza virus, RSV, parainfluenza virus (PIV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV).\n\n【16】Global patterns in monthly activity of influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, and metapneumovirus: a systematic analysis.\n\n【17】Influenza virus exhibited distinct seasonality in winter months in temperate climates, but the timing of epidemics was less seasonal at locations closer to the equator. Epidemics of RSV were seasonal in all regions, starting in late summer in the tropics, and showing increased prominence during the winter in temperate sites. Parainfluenza virus epidemics occurred primarily in spring and early summer. Metapneumovirus epidemics happened in late winter and spring in most temperate sites.\n\n【18】Importantly in this extensive analysis, the association between seasonality and temperature and relative humidity was different for influenza virus and RSV. Lower temperature was associated with higher activity of both viruses; however, higher relative humidity was associated with increased influenza virus activity if temperature was above average. In contrast, RSV activity was higher when the temperature was lower than average. This important work illustrates the complexity of the mechanisms of viral persistence and transmission and the importance of considering the impact of environmental factors on a virus-by-virus basis.\n\n【19】Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 most often spreads via droplets when infected persons exhale, cough, sneeze, or talk. Although a less prominent mechanism of transmission, airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is currently a topic of growing interest.\n\n【20】Aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 as compared with SARS-CoV-1.\n\n【21】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【22】Aerodynamic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in two Wuhan hospitals.\n\n【23】The virus may remain infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days. This emerging observation opens the door to mitigating interventions focused on ventilation and air filtration.\n\n【24】The link between humidity and temperature and the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been evoked but remains to be established. A recent study used weather data and global reports of infection to model COVID-19 growth rate before any intervention. This study indicated that higher temperature increased COVID-19 growth rate, relative humidity was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in growth rate, and ultraviolet light had the strongest effect in decreasing COVID-19 growth rate. Most importantly, a majority (64%) of the variation in COVID-19 growth rate remained unexplained by meteorological data. Examples of putative yet unmeasured factors include movements of persons inside and outside buildings and variations in immune response, possibly mediated in part by exposure to vitamin D.\n\n【25】Although it should be emphasized that the evolution of the current pandemic will provide more data points and inform future modeling, the available information urges caution with regard to the assumption of a substantial seasonal reprieve of the infection rates.\n\n【26】Practical Recommendations\n-------------------------\n\n【27】Interventions on environmental factors to mitigate viral transmission must be grounded in science. Indoor humidity and temperature levels are the product of a dynamic interaction between the outdoor and indoor environments and other factors such as building materials and configuration (eg, window tightness), air-conditioning systems, and the number of occupants. Options to control indoor humidity include in-duct humidifiers in central air systems or portable humidifiers, which are attractive because of ease of installation.\n\n【28】Because indoor humidity is not uniform, particularly in larger spaces or in residences with multiple rooms, its accurate assessment requires measurements at multiple locations, especially areas close to doors, windows, supply air diffusers, and return-air grilles. For most commonly available humidity sensors, the measurement error is less than 5% and therefore adequate for typical residential use. The American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends maintaining indoor relative humidity (RH) within the range of 40% to 60 % RH, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends maintaining 30% to 50% RH, ranges that optimize thermal comfort, air quality, and reduce growth of mold. Indoor temperatures should be maintained within comfortable ranges.\n\n【29】With regard to future research, emerging evidence on possible airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the importance of studies focused on ventilation and air-filtration optimization to reduce transmission of viruses.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【31】This perspective underscores the critical importance of multidisciplinary research to advance science and practice on this topic. Virologists focus on events within the host cells, whereas public health scientists focus on exposures in populations and on the circulation of pathogens in communities. Building scientists focus on the optimization of our residential and working environments and how it can promote overall health. Research questions are often analogous across these scientific domains, which constitute a singular opportunity for transdisciplinary work. The worldwide threat of COVID-19 constitutes the most powerful call to action to deploy this needed team science approach.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:02:50", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:04:29", "cost": 98.268}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:32", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:04:27", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:02:48"}

In all 5 patients, the clinical course was complicated by spontaneous gastrointestinal (GI), mucosal, or excessive postoperative bleeding associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS); surgical septal myectomy, used to treat HOCM, produced resolution of the bleeding diathesis. Although such case histories tend to be dismissed as a chance association, the association of HOCM repair and resolution of von Willebrand syndrome parallels the experience after cardiac valve replacement in aortic stenosis (AS).\n\n【1】Acquired von Willebrand syndrome in aortic stenosis.\n\n【2】As such, the report by Blackshear et al provides valuable validation of existing theories linking blood flow conditions of high shear stress (ie, increased velocity between adjacent layers of blood flowing within the vasculature) to AvWS. The physiology underlying this phenomenon will be briefly reviewed.\n\n【3】von Willebrand factor (vWF), a large multimeric glycoprotein, is synthesized in bone marrow megakaryocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Extensive posttranslational modification of the primary gene product results in vWF multimers ranging in size from 500 kD to 10 million kD or larger (unusually large multimers).\n\n【4】After endothelial secretion, ADAMTS-13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) cleaves vWF at the Tyr 1605-Met 1606 bond within the A2 domain,\n\n【5】preferentially under blood flow conditions of high intravascular shear stress, resulting in cleavage of the vWF multimers, especially the larger or high-molecular-weight multimers (HMWMs). Thus, circulating plasma vWF multimers reflect an equilibrium between secretion of vWF containing large and unusually large multimers and their cleavage into smaller derivatives, which, when visualized on agarose electrophoretic gels,\n\n【6】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【7】are categorized as low-molecular-weight multimers (<6 bands), intermediate-molecular-weight multimers (6-10 bands), and large multimers or HMWMs (>10 bands).\n\n【8】von Willebrand disease (vWD), the most common congenital autosomal bleeding disorder, is caused by quantitative and qualitative defects of vWF but may also be acquired (AvWS).\n\n【9】von Willebrand disease (VWD): evidence-based diagnosis and management guidelines, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Expert Panel report (USA).\n\n【10】An increasing number of medical disorders associated with AvWS are being recognized\n\n【11】 however, AvWS pathogenesis has been elucidated in only a few associated disorders . Investigations into the association between AS and GI hemorrhage have shed light on the role of increased shear stress and loss of vWF HMWMs.\n\n【12】Acquired von Willebrand syndrome in aortic stenosis.\n\n【13】The observed vWF abnormalities were reversed after aortic valve replacement surgery and recurred in selected patients with mismatched prostheses and in patients in whom AS recurred. Similarly, other cardiovascular disorders associated with increased intravascular shear stress could result in AvWS. One such disorder, HOCM, is associated with vWF abnormalities similar to those in AS.\n\n【14】Functional impairment of von Willebrand factor in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: relation to rest and exercise obstruction.\n\n【15】However, it remained unknown whether HOCM-associated acquired vWF abnormalities have clinical consequences (ie, whether they cause AvWS with a propensity for clinical bleeding). Blackshear et al clearly identified consequential AvWS-associated GI hemorrhage in patients with HOCM and showed that septal myectomy resulted in normalization of the vWF multimers and subsequent resolution of GI hemorrhage, similar to the experience with AS.\n\n【16】Acquired von Willebrand syndrome in aortic stenosis.\n\n【17】Collectively, the data confirm the association between loss of vWF HMWMs and conditions of high intravascular shear stress and imply a potential, or at least a partial, causal relationship between acquired vWF abnormalities and GI hemorrhage in this group of patients.\n\n【18】TABLE Diseases Pathophysiologically Associated With AvWS\n\n【19】From _Am J Hematol,B_ with permission from Wiley and Sons, Inc.\n\n| Pathophysiologic category | Disease or association |\n| --- | --- |\n| Antibodies to vWF | Lymphoproliferative diseases, monoclonal gammopathies, or autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus |\n| Shear-induced vWF conformational changes leading to increased proteolysis of vWF | Ventricular septal defect, aortic valvular stenosis, hypertrophie obstructive cardiomyopathy, left ventricular assist device, or primary pulmonary hypertension |\n| Markedly elevated blood platelet count | Essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis, or other myeloproliferative disorders |\n| Removal of vWF from circulation by aberrant binding to tumor cells | Wilm tumor and certain lymphoproliferative or plasma cell proliferative disorders |\n| Decreased vWF synthesis | Hypothyroidism |\n| Drugs associated with AvWS | Ciprofloxacin, valproic acid, hydroxyethyl starch, and griseofulvin |\n\n【21】AvWS = acquired von Willebrand syndrome; vWF = von Willebrand factor.\n\n【22】It has been well demonstrated that patients with hereditary vWD and those with AvWS have a propensity to develop GI arteriovenous malformation (AVM)–associated hemorrhage,\n\n【23】but the link between abnormalities of vWF and bleeding GI AVMs has remained elusive. The recent report by Starke et al\n\n【24】Endothelial von Willebrand factor regulates angiogenesis.\n\n【25】sheds light on the role of endothelial vWF in angiogenesis. The authors demonstrated that small interfering RNA–mediated inhibition of vWF expression in endothelial cells increased in vitro angiogenesis and release of angiogenic factors. These observations were confirmed in experiments using endothelial cells from patients with vWD and in a mouse model of vWD, thus identifying a novel angiogenesis regulatory function for vWF. Although vWF multimerization was not studied by Starke et al, it is tempting to speculate that it plays a role in angiogenesis regulation and that vWF HMWMs are of particular importance.\n\n【26】This association between AvWS and cardiovascular disorders raises several important questions for the clinician, regarding patient selection for testing, and for the performing laboratory, regarding the extent of laboratory testing that is warranted. Should all patients with predisposing cardiovascular disorders undergo comprehensive testing for vWD? If so, what extent of testing is warranted? Should all patients undergo vWF multimer analysis, which is a labor-intensive assay with limited clinical availability? And finally, how will laboratory test results influence patient management?\n\n【27】Currently suggested initial laboratory work-up for patients with vWD consists of the following: (1) measurement of plasma vWF antigen (vWF:Ag); (2) assays of plasma vWF activity, most commonly the vWF ristocetin cofactor activity (vWF:RCo) assay; and (3) the plasma coagulation factor VIII activity assay. Reduced vWF levels and/or abnormal vWF:RCo/vWF:Ag ratios typically prompt reflexive analysis of vWF multimers for the purpose of subtyping vWD.\n\n【28】Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: a synopsis of the 2008 NHLBI/NIH guidelines.\n\n【29】Limitations of current technologies preclude reliance solely on the vWF:RCo/vWF:Ag ratio and levels to evaluate for vWD and AvWS.\n\n【30】Indeed, in the Blackshear et al series of patients, vWF:RCo/vWF:Ag ratios and levels were normal, raising the question of whether all such patients should undergo vWF multimer analysis.\n\n【31】A reasonable approach to patient selection for laboratory testing is to pursue initial vWD laboratory testing on the basis of published algorithms and recommendations for patients with symptomatic bleeding or increased risk of bleeding. However, for selected patients, such as those with cardiovascular disorders causing the increased intravascular shear flow conditions associated with AvWS pathogenesis, supplemental vWF multimer analysis should be considered despite normal vWF levels and ratios.\n\n【32】Clinical and laboratory diagnosis of von Willebrand disease: a synopsis of the 2008 NHLBI/NIH guidelines.\n\n【33】When more reliable assays for vWF activity are readily available,\n\n【34】A highly-sensitive plasma von Willebrand factor ristocetin cofactor (VWF:RCo) activity assay by flow cytometry.\n\n【35】vWF multimer analysis can be mostly confined to patients with low levels of plasma vWF or abnormal vWF activity to vWF:Ag ratios.\n\n【36】Regarding the effect on patient management, the diagnosis of AvWS may explain hemorrhagic symptoms in the group of patients with predisposing cardiovascular disorders, and AvWS may be an additional indication for consideration of surgical correction of the underlying cardiovascular disorder. Monitoring for reversal of the acquired abnormalities of vWF may provide an additional tool to evaluate the efficacy of surgical management. Thus, patients with cardiovascular disorders associated with increased intravascular shear stress have a propensity for acquired loss of vWF HMWMs and also for AvWS, the latter patients often exhibiting GI AVM–associated hemorrhage that may primarily reflect altered vWF influences on angiogenesis.

Specifically, the authors identified a hazard ratio of 2.11 (95% CI, 1.50 to 2.72) for patients with more than 5.1 years of cumulative PPI exposure in comparison to patients without PPI exposure, after adjustment for covariates. This finding was driven by heart failure events, showing a hazard ratio of 2.21 (95% CI, 1.51 to 3.23) for those with more than 5.1 years of PPI exposure. The authors hypothesize that long-term exposure to PPIs may pathologically promote the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD).\n\n【6】The study has a number of strengths in design. First, it evaluates a longitudinal patient cohort through the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (ARIC), which included extensive collection of data on potential covariates, maintenance of a high follow-up rate, and inclusion of a community-based population. The authors also performed a thorough analysis to account for confounding variables, including analyses to demonstrate consistency of their finding. In particular, the authors’ results were consistent even after removal of patients who had ever reported symptoms of angina, such that patients with angina thought to have acid reflux who were treated with PPIs did not confer an additional bias. Moreover, the authors performed an insightful and unique assessment for lifetime PPI exposure. The beginning of the ARIC study also largely preceded the widespread use of PPIs, eliminating the risk of prior PPI exposure. It is also worth noting that the design of a large, prospective randomized trial of PPI-naïve patients who are observed during multiple years of therapy would be challenging, particularly given the variety of clinical scenarios in which PPIs are used and common application.\n\n【7】There were also several limitations to the findings of the study. In a biracial patient demographic, findings may not be extendable to non-White and non–African American populations. In addition, a number of assumptions were made in calculating total PPI exposure time, which used a “last-observation-carried-forward” technique. Specifically, the authors assumed that a PPI was taken continuously if it was reported on consecutive visits and that if data were absent at 1 visit, the most recent ascertainment was still assumed to hold true. This was most significant for the approximately 9-year period between visit 4 and telephone follow-up in 2006, during which 87% of patients did not have PPI use ascertained. Furthermore, the mechanism for potential PPI-induced increase in CVD has not been elucidated, and the authors offer limited insight into the pathophysiology. Specifically, the mechanism for increased heart failure events, which was the primary driver of the combined end point, is not clear, although PPI-induced reduction of myocardial contractility was proposed.\n\n【8】Most notably, a major limitation is that causality inference is limited because of the observational, retrospective nature of the study. Nonetheless, certain features of this study do strengthen the case for causality, with particular attention to those delineated by the Bradford Hill criteria.\n\n【9】First, the authors found a considerable 2-fold increase in the primary outcome in patients who took PPIs for more than 5 years compared with those who did not have PPI exposure. Because patients who developed CVD before the “baseline” assessment (visit 5 of ARIC) were excluded, the degree of increased risk could, in fact, be higher. Second, the link between PPIs and CVD has been suggested in prior retrospective analyses,\n\n【10】Long-term use of proton pump inhibitors, dose-response relationship and associated risk of ischemic stroke and myocardial infarction.\n\n【11】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【12】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【13】Use of proton-pump inhibitors predicts heart failure and death in patients with coronary artery disease.\n\n【14】which suggests reproducibility. Third, the increase in risk in an exposure-dependent manner strengthens the case for a cause and effect association. Therefore, although not definitively established, certain features of the study lend credence to a possible causal relationship. In any case, the findings in the article of Bell et al support an initiative for prompt discontinuation of PPIs when these medications are no longer indicated.\n\n【15】This important implication is relevant to practice patterns that were highlighted in a recent article by Blackett et al.\n\n【16】In their article, the authors evaluated a population of adult patients admitted across 9 intensive care units between 2014 and 2018 who were initiated on PPIs on admission. Patients with an appropriate long-term PPI indication were excluded. From their cohort of 2467 patients, the authors found that 45% of patients were continued on a PPI after floor transfer, and 27% of patients were prescribed a PPI on discharge despite lack of an outpatient indication.\n\n【17】The practice of initiating stress ulcer prophylaxis in critical care is common and endorsed by societal guideline committees for select critically ill patients.\n\n【18】删除21:<u>Surviving sepsis campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock: 2016.</u>\n\n【19】Although it is data driven and well intentioned, the possibility of causing harm, if it is continued on a long-term basis after resolution of the acute illness, is palpable, particularly after considering the findings from Bell et al. As Blackett et al also point out in their article, perhaps a reason for provider hesitancy is reluctance to stop a medication that the provider did not start. However, the onus stands on both hospital physicians and outpatient providers to pay careful attention to the medication reconciliation and to ensure that each ordered medication is appropriately indicated. A multidisciplinary approach with subspecialty services and rehabilitation teams in determining medication appropriateness may also be helpful, given that risk of inappropriate PPI continuation was increased for patients who had undergone endoscopy and for patients requiring rehabilitative services or residential care after discharge. Although this example focuses on the hospital and perihospital setting, it highlights an important area in which simple modifications of clinical practice may enhance long-term outcomes by avoiding the cumulative adverse effects of PPIs altogether.\n\n【20】Additional work remains to better understand the link between PPI use and cardiovascular risk, including identifying a mechanism for pathologic effects of PPIs and clarifying the strength of the relationship between PPIs and CVD. The role of histamine type 2 receptor antagonists will also need to be elucidated as an alternative to both short- and long-term therapy. Regardless, the outlined studies do highlight the dangers of polypharmacy and how simply overlooking a “benign” medication may, in fact, produce tangible harm. Polypharmacy itself has become increasingly common on an international scale and has been linked, albeit through mostly observational studies, to adverse events, including decline in physical and cognitive function, hospitalization, and death.\n\n【21】It therefore behooves the modern-day physician to “do no harm” and to take caution in prescribing, refilling, and renewing unnecessary medications, PPIs as well as other medications, to provide optimal patient care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:33:14", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:33:44", "cost": 30.122}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:32", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:33:44", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:33:13"}

Rates of in-hospital mortality were almost 200-fold higher among those who had acute PE (29.3 vs 0.13, per 1000 pregnancy-related, _P_ <.001). The rate of in-hospital mortality did not change among women with acute PE (2.6% in 2007 vs 2.5% in 2015, _P_ <sub>trends </sub> \\=.74).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In this contemporary analysis of pregnancy-related hospitalizations, acute PE was uncommon, but rates have not decreased over the past decade. Acute PE during pregnancy and puerperium was associated with high maternal mortality, and the rates of in-hospital mortality have not improved. Future studies to improve prevention and management of acute PE during pregnancy and puerperium are warranted.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CI ( confidence interval ), DVT ( deep venous thrombosis ), ICD ( International Classification of Diseases ), IVC ( inferior vena cava ), NIS ( National Inpatient Sample ), OR ( odds ratio ), PE ( pulmonary embolism ), VTE ( venous thromboembolism )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:53:34", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:53:58", "cost": 24.148}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:32", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:53:58", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:53:33"}

We evaluated the bleeding risks of performing lumbar punctures in patients who are using or have recently used antiplatelet agents by retrospective review of lumbar punctures performed at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between 2004 and 2018 in patients who were actively using or recently used aspirin or clopidogrel, or both. Patients were stratified into time groups based on when the lumbar puncture was done relative to the time the antiplatelet drug was discontinued: <1 week, 1-4 weeks, >4 weeks. We recorded red blood cell counts for the earliest and latest spinal fluid collections to determine the risk of traumatic bleeding; we also noted any complications. Antiplatelet medication use within 1 week of lumbar puncture was associated with a 3% incidence of bloody tap and 4% incidence of traumatic tap that cleared. In the group of patients who waited for a lumbar puncture at least 4 weeks after discontinuation of antiplatelet drug, there was a 5% incidence of bloody or traumatic tap. There was no difference in rates of bleeding between aspirin versus aspirin plus clopidogrel. The rate of hematoma complications was highest in the group of patients on aspirin at the time of the procedure (0.7%).

While the resulting platelets can be hemostatically competent, they are often dysfunctional, leading either to spontaneous hemorrhage or to in situ thrombosis.\n\n【3】Elevated platelet counts in ET in high-risk patients are typically treated with hydroxyurea or anagrelide in younger patients or in those who cannot tolerate hydroxyurea. A thrombotic tendency, should it exist, is commonly treated with aspirin. In this issue of _Proceedings_ , Fang and colleagues\n\n【4】Medical management of a large aortic thrombus in a young woman with essential thrombocythemia.\n\n【5】describe the case of a middle-aged woman with ET who presented with abdominal and lower extremity pain, gastrointestinal cramping and diarrhea, and transient mottling of the toes. By abdominal computed tomography, the patient was found to have visceral infarctions and a large aortic thrombus. Treatment with hydroxyurea and aspirin was accompanied by complete resolution of the thrombus after 3 weeks, with no apparent clinical sequelae. The authors state that, to their knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the resolution of an aortic thrombus in a patient with ET treated with medical therapy alone.\n\n【6】Platelet function in patients with ET can be either normal or abnormal; dysfunctional platelets are frequently hemostatically incompetent, leading to hemorrhage, or hyperaggregable, leading to thrombosis. Thrombotic events are typically arterial or microvascular and commonly develop in situ. The renal and splenic infarctions reported in this patient without documented atherosclerotic vascular disease may have been a consequence of in situ thrombosis; however, owing to the size of the aortic thrombus and its location, we cannot exclude peripheral embolization as an underlying pathophysiological mechanism for these visceral infarctions. In support of this mechanism are the transient mottling of the patient's left foot on presentation and the irregular nature of the aortic thrombus, both clues to the embolic propensity of the thrombus.\n\n【7】The authors claim that the resolution of the aortic thrombus was a direct consequence of the therapy administered to the patient. This hypothesis is provocative and warrants careful consideration. Hydroxyurea suppresses clonal expansion and decreases the platelet count, thereby reducing the rate of accretion of platelets to the thrombus both by decreasing the derivation of hyperaggregable platelets from the clone and by a cellular “mass action” effect. In addition, aspirin suppresses platelet activation and granule secretion,\n\n【8】which limits recruitment of platelets to the thrombus. However, to attribute the dissolution of the thrombus to the effects of these agents alone is not supported by known mechanisms of thrombus clearance.\n\n【9】Antithrombotic agents, including both antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants, principally prevent thrombus growth by inhibiting platelet activation and fibrin formation. Thrombus is cleared from the circulation by endogenous thrombolytic mechanisms, including plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis and macrophage-mediated clearance through the action of lysozomal enzymes such as cathepsin D.\n\n【10】One may argue that the platelet-rich nature of the ET thrombus limits its ability to be cleared by these endogenous mechanisms, and available data do, indeed, support the platelet-rich predominance of these “white” thrombi, at least in the microvasculature.\n\n【11】Erythromelalgia in essential thrombocythemia is characterized by platelet activation and endothelial cell damage but not by thrombin generation.\n\n【12】However, no thrombus, least of all an extensive, large aortic thrombus, is likely to be a “pure” platelet thrombus. In addition, even pure platelet thrombi are held together by fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor polymers that bridge platelets by binding to glycoprotein IIb/IIIa or glycoprotein Ib/IX. Plasmin, generated by the action of endogenous plasminogen activators on plasminogen, can degrade fibrinogen to facilitate platelet disaggregation,\n\n【13】cleave glycoprotein Ib from the platelet surface to impair von Willebrand factor-dependent adhesion,\n\n【14】and proteolyze glycoprotein IIIa to weaken the affinity of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa for fibrinogen,\n\n【15】all leading to impaired platelet function.\n\n【16】Other endogenous platelet inhibitors can act synergistically with plasmin to facilitate platelet disaggregation, including endothelial nitric oxide and prostacyclin,\n\n【17】and these endothelial products are likely important for limiting thrombus growth as well as facilitating its endogenous dissolution. Aspirin can, as well, promote thrombus dissolution by facilitating platelet disaggregation,\n\n【18】suggesting another mechanism by which the aspirin used to treat this patient may have contributed to the ultimate dissolution of the thrombus. It is then reasonable to conclude that, as a combined result of lowering the platelet count, inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation, and facilitating platelet disaggregation, thrombus growth was inhibited and its endogenous dissolution facilitated.\n\n【19】One must, however, also consider the possibility that these agents led to lysis of the thrombus in a process that involved fragmentation and peripheral embolization. These events, had they occurred, were clinically silent. Nevertheless, that they occurred cannot be excluded since clinically silent arterial embolic events have been documented to occur in both autopsy and imaging studies-even in the central nervous system.\n\n【20】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【21】The use of thrombolytic therapy for peripheral arterial embolism has been reported to produce distal embolization in up to 12% of patients.\n\n【22】Acute limb deterioration during intra-arterial thrombolysis.\n\n【23】In the case described by Fang et al,\n\n【24】Medical management of a large aortic thrombus in a young woman with essential thrombocythemia.\n\n【25】the abdominal aortic location of the thrombus limited its embolic potential to the visceral, renal, and peripheral circulatory beds. The authors do not report the results of examination of the peripheral pulses, the ankle-brachial index, peripheral pulse volume recordings, or a urinalysis that might have been used to exclude small or clinically subtle peripheral emboli arising from treatment.\n\n【26】Antiplatelet therapy appears to be a potentially useful approach to the treatment of a presumed platelet-rich arterial thrombus in patients with ET. However, treatment with medical therapy alone should be individualized on the basis of the location of the thrombus, its potential for embolism, and the suitability of the patient for thrombectomy.\n\n【27】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【28】Antiplatelet therapy can readily facilitate thrombus resolution but may also facilitate embolization, emphasizing the therapeutic challenge that confronts the clinician in these uncommon but difficult cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:27:00", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:27:33", "cost": 32.516}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:32", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:27:33", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:27:00"}

We concur fully but note that nursing presence and involvement can vary by service and institution. A dedicated nephrology nurse-educator may prove vital to the initial disease explanation, treatment clarification, and anxiety reduction for a patient with newly diagnosed chronic kidney disease. In contrast, an “agency” or “shift” nurse who may not have reviewed the patient's medical record is unlikely to ease the patient's stress generated by awareness of the failure of a vital system. Our renal service incorporates and relies on nursing presence, starting with the patient's first contact, and subsequently depends on a skilled nephrology nurse to fill the void sometimes created by incomplete discussions with the responsible but “rushed” nephrologist.\n\n【1】With a growing “shift mentality” for duty hours among health care providers and the large number of various professionals who interact with patients during their progressively shorter hospitalizations, there must be recognition of the necessity for proper staff identification to the patient by the health care “team.” This will be the key to humanizing our care. In the field of medicine, fiscal pressures have resulted in replacement of nurses by technicians and other ancillary staff, complicating the task of fusing patients to a specific nurse or physician.

Head and neck structures govern many of the 5 senses, swallowing, breathing, communication, facial animation, and aesthetics. Loss of these functions can have a severe negative effect on patient quality of life. Regenerative medicine techniques have the potential to restore these functions while minimizing the risks associated with traditional reconstruction techniques. This article serves as a review and update on some of the regenerative medicine research in this field. A description of the predominant clinical problems is presented, followed by a discussion of some of the most promising research working toward a solution. There are many noteworthy findings appropriate for inclusion, but limitations preclude mention of them all. This article focuses on laryngeal surgery, craniofacial reconstruction and plastic surgery, and otology and hearing.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ASC ( adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell ), bFGF ( basic fibroblast growth factor ), BMP ( bone morphogenetic protein ), BMSC ( bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cell ), ECM ( extracellular matrix ), FGF ( fibroblast growth factor ), HA ( hyaluronic acid ), HGF ( hepatocyte growth factor ), Oto-HNS ( otorhinolaryngology–head and neck surgery ), PLGA ( poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) ), SLP ( superficial lamina propria ), TGF ( transforming growth factor )\n\n【4】**CME Activity**\n\n【5】**Accreditation:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\n【6】**Credit Statement:** Mayo Clinic College of Medicine designates this journal-based CME activity for a maximum of 1.0 _AMA PRA Category 1 Credit(s)._ <sup>TM </sup> Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\n【7】**Learning Objectives:** On completion of this article, you should be able to (1) summarize the role of regenerative medicine in treating the anatomical and functional deficits that affect the head and neck region, (2) differentiate the benefits and drawbacks of various tissue engineering techniques when applied to distinct head and neck subsites, and (3) recognize areas in need of further investigation prior to clinical application.\n\n【8】**Disclosures:** As a provider accredited by ACCME, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine (Mayo School of Continuous Professional Development) must ensure balance, independence, objectivity, and scientiﬁc rigor in its educational activities.

Some of these vital functions include hearing, balance, air filtration and humidification, facial animation, deglutition, breathing, and speaking. These vast functional tissue differences make tissue regeneration in the head and neck challenging and exciting.\n\n【10】Regenerative medicine techniques are being studied to manage the many etiologies of head and neck disorders. However, most research in Oto-HNS is focused on functional reconstruction of cancer defects. Cancers in this region are associated with high morbidity and mortality. The biggest contributing factor to these poor outcomes is the deficit that remains after surgical resection or radiotherapy. For some patients, loss of these functional tissues may result in deafness, a permanent tracheotomy tube or tracheostoma, or a permanent percutaneous feeding tube. Many patients succumb to their disease only because the anticipated functional deficits prevent treatment. In addition to the functional deficits, the aesthetic and social embarrassment that accompanies these defects can lead to social isolation and depression. Many patients choose to perish from the disease rather than experience this loss of quality of life.\n\n【11】Transplantation of head and neck structures can overcome these functional and aesthetic concerns. However, the requisite immunosuppression prevents the use of traditional transplantation techniques. Transplantation of bioengineered tissues, however, bypasses the need for immunosuppression and has the potential to vastly improve the morbidity and mortality associated with head and neck cancers. Although regenerative medicine is a relatively new field, there have been many exciting discoveries in all areas of the head and neck that promise to benefit numerous Oto-HNS patients. This article focuses on the head and neck subsites that have had the largest depth of study and the most significant findings to date: laryngeal surgery, craniofacial reconstruction and plastic surgery, and otology and hearing.\n\n【12】Applications in Laryngeal Surgery\n---------------------------------\n\n【13】The larynx is a true biomechanical structure—it is both a living organ and a machine. Laryngeal mechanics necessitate multiplanar movement of the vocal folds. Open vocal folds facilitate breathing. Closing the vocal folds serves as a protective valve for the airway during deglutition. Also during deglutition, the entire larynx must move superiorly and anteriorly to open the esophageal inlet. Forced exhalation of air against closed vocal folds enables phonation. Pitch variation is achieved through shortening and lengthening of the vocal folds.\n\n【14】The larynx is composed of multiple different tissue types. The supraglottis and subglottis consist of respiratory mucosa. The specialized layered microstructure of the vocal folds consists of squamous epithelium, lamina propria (superficial, middle, and deep layers), and muscle . The superficial layer of the lamina propria (SLP) plays the most important role in phonation.\n\n【15】Figure 1 Vocal fold layers: superior view (A), cross section (B), and individual layers (C). The specialized structure of the vocal folds is in large part created through vibration. The superficial layer of the lamina propria is vital to phonation. BMZ = basement membrane zone.\n\n【16】Restoration of laryngeal anatomy and function is difficult given the complex nature of this organ. Procedures can be performed to individually improve airway, voice, or swallowing. However, improvement of one function is usually at the sacrifice of another. There is currently nothing that can be done to improve all laryngeal functions simultaneously. Tissue engineering of new functional laryngeal tissue can help millions of patients, from those with scarred vocal folds to laryngectomy. Laryngeal regeneration research is currently focused on vocal fold microstructure restoration and on laryngeal superstructure regeneration.\n\n【17】### Vocal Folds\n\n【18】The vocal folds are the functional unit of the larynx. Their function depends on neuromuscular activity for gross movement and on pliability for phonation. Loss of pliability from scar formation can result from long-term vocal misuse, trauma, or surgery. The present therapeutic materials (most commonly collagen and fat) do not have viscoelastic properties similar to the natural lamina propria and do not promote tissue regeneration or repair.\n\n【19】Vocal fold regeneration would have widespread benefit to patient care. Reduction in scarring can create a normal voice in a patient who was previously aphonic or may allow a professional singer to prolong a career. Regeneration of an entire vocal fold may allow speech in a patient after a cancer resection. This is also a paramount step in the regeneration of a total larynx.\n\n【20】Regenerative therapies for scar essentially encompass 2 main strategies. The first strategy is to inhibit or repair the process of scarring and fibrosis. The second aim is to rebuild the native extracellular matrix (ECM). Generally, tissue engineering consists of 3 interconnected approaches : (1) development and implementation of scaffolds, (2) use of bioactive factors, and (3) use of cell therapy.\n\n【21】Figure 2 Tissue engineering fundamentals. Tissue engineering requires the synergistic combination of cells, scaffolds, and bioactive factors. Cells develop into the desired tissue, scaffolds provide structure and support, and bioactive factors aid in differentiation and cell nutrition.\n\n【22】#### Scaffolds\n\n【23】Decellularized organ matrix, biological polymers, synthetic biomimetic hydrogels, and synthetic polymers have all been described as scaffolds for 3-dimensional lamina propria replacement.\n\n【24】Injectable scaffolds have the advantages of ease of application, biomechanical properties similar to native lamina propria, and the ability to deliver cells and bioactive factors. They have the ability to modulate the inflammatory response and direct ECM remodeling.\n\n【25】Experimental hydrogel scaffolds for vocal fold regeneration have been primarily based on chemical modiﬁcation of hyaluronic acid (HA), with reactive chemical groups that can rapidly cross-link in situ after injection. Hyaluronic acid is a common scaffold material owing to its biocompatibility and properties similar to native SLP.\n\n【26】Most hydrogels are designed to improve the SLP because it is the area most important to phonation and is the most common site of injury. However, most vocal fold defects usually involve more than 1 layer. Kutty and Webb\n\n【27】developed a 2-layer hydrogel system consisting of methacrylated HA and acrylated polyethylene glycol derivatives to replace a multilayered structure. Gel formulations were developed that approximated the rheologic (HA) and tensile (polyethylene glycol) properties of the SLP and the vocal ligament, respectively. The hydrogel materials were found to support ﬁbroblast spreading, proliferation, and collagen/glycosaminoglycan synthesis. The hydrogels could be varied in duration from weeks to months independent of the mechanical properties.\n\n【28】Studies also suggest that injectable HA-based hydrogels may accelerate tissue remodeling through amplification of biochemical responses during the acute healing phase.\n\n【29】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【30】The use of acellular biological scaffolds is an alternative to hydrogels. These scaffolds are decellularized to remove immunogenic foreign epitopes, followed by recellularization. There are many benefits to this type of scaffold. The tissue has a similar composition, mechanical property, and architecture as that of native tissue. They release growth factors and peptides that stimulate angiogenesis, recruit endogenous marrow-derived cells, and govern tissue remodeling. They also ease attachment, migration, and infiltration of host cells; attract biofactors; and can degrade within a few months.\n\n【31】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【32】Preserved extracellular matrix components and retained biological activity in decellularized porcine mesothelium.\n\n【33】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【34】The retention of extracellular matrix proteins and angiogenic and mitogenic cytokines in a decellularized porcine dermis.\n\n【35】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【36】Development of bioengineered human larynx.\n\n【37】Decellularized matrices have been widely studied in animal models and humans. Xu et al\n\n【38】used a saline-based osmotic approach to create a decellularized bovine lamina propria and epithelium. They observed early infiltration of host fibroblasts and inflammatory cells after implantation in freshly injured rat vocal folds. Human vocal fold fibroblasts attached, proliferated, and synthesized ECM containing collagen, HA, decorin, and ﬁbronectin. Histologic results showed that the scaffolds were degraded after 3 months, with no fibrotic tissue formation or calcification.\n\n【39】Repopulated ECM scaffolds were shown to exhibit elastic shear modulus and dynamic viscosity comparable with human vocal mucosa at physiologic frequencies (100-250 Hz).\n\n【40】#### Cell Transplantation\n\n【41】Cells are vital to tissue engineering. They are involved in the initial construct development, maintain function after implantation, and improve functioning of the other tissue components. Many cell types have been studied for vocal fold regeneration, but fibroblasts and stem cells seem the most promising to date.\n\n【42】Autologous fibroblasts derived from buccal mucosa were first investigated by Chhetri et al.\n\n【43】Fibroblasts were injected into a unilateral full-thickness lamina propria injury in a canine model. Each animal received 3 injections of approximately 25 million cells at weekly intervals beginning 6 to 8 weeks after injury. Vibratory and acoustic performance returned to near baseline levels by 29 weeks. The fibroblast-treated vocal folds stained positive for ECM components. Histologic analysis demonstrated increased ﬁbroblasts, collagen, and reticulin; decreased elastin; and equal HA relative to the uninjured vocal folds.\n\n【44】Stem cells are a popular option for vocal fold regeneration. They come in many forms but essentially break down into embryonic and adult. Embryonic stem cells have demonstrated some benefit in vocal fold regeneration, but the technical and ethical hurdles currently preclude widespread investigation. Autologous adult-derived cells are easier to study and have shown some benefit. Bone marrow–derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) injected before or during injury have been shown to prevent the gross appearance of scar in dogs\n\n【45】Regeneration of the vocal fold using autologous mesenchymal stem cells.\n\n【46】and to improve rheologic properties in rabbits.\n\n【47】Viscoelastic and histologic properties in scarred rabbit vocal folds after mesenchymal stem cell injection.\n\n【48】Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) are a particularly promising cell type for the treatment of scarred vocal folds. In vitro trials have shown that ASCs secrete several growth factors that balance collagen and HA in the ECM. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is believed to be a major component of these and is discussed later in the article. Briefly, studies have shown that ASCs secrete HGFs that attenuate collagen production and fibroblast proliferation in culture. The ASCs can also produce elastic fibers, which typically does not occur in a scar environment.\n\n【49】The ASCs have been used to tissue engineer a multilayered structure for vocal fold replacement.\n\n【50】In this model, ASCs differentiated into epithelial and mesenchymal lineages by physical and biochemical stimulation.\n\n【51】#### Bioactive Factors\n\n【52】Growth factors are peptide molecules that function to regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. They have been studied extensively and have shown clinical success in human clinical studies. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and HGF warrant specific mention.\n\n【53】Hirano et al\n\n【54】first described using bFGF in a human vocal fold in 2008. Injection into an atrophic vocal fold demonstrated improvement of aerodynamic and acoustic parameters 1 week after injection and lasted up to 3 months. Other studies by the same group showed that bFGF significantly increased fibroblast production of HA and decreased collagen deposition in aged rat vocal folds.\n\n【55】The bFGF has also been found to upregulate HA synthase and matrix metalloproteinase-2 production,\n\n【56】downregulate expression of procollagen I, and increase expression of fibronectin and HGF.\n\n【57】Hepatocyte growth factor is a pleiotropic cytokine with a favorable profile for vocal fold healing. It has strong antifibrotic potency,\n\n【58】increases HA and elastin synthesis, decreases collagen synthesis, induces cell growth and migration, and is highly angiogenic. Hepatocyte growth factor and its receptor c-Met have been detected in epithelial and gland cells of normal vocal folds and in the lamina propria after injury.\n\n【59】Hirano et al\n\n【60】Growth factor therapy for vocal fold scarring in a canine model.\n\n【61】performed a one-time injection of HGF into rabbit vocal folds after unilateral mucosal stripping. Six months after injury, HGF-injected vocal folds exhibited signiﬁcantly decreased collagen accumulation in response to injury and no signiﬁcant changes in collagen, elastin, or HA levels relative to the uninjured contralateral vocal fold.\n\n【62】#### Mechanotransduction\n\n【63】Vocal fold maturation seems to depend on phonation-derived mechanical stimulation and hormonal signaling. Neonatal vocal folds are homogenous tissues lacking the layered microstructure observed in the adult.\n\n【64】Interestingly, a study by Sato et al\n\n【65】demonstrated that vocal fold vibration induces differentiation of the vocal fold lamina propria. In their study, vocal folds unphonated (no vibration) for 11 years and 2 months were investigated by light and electron microscopy. They found atrophy of the lamina propria, with no differentiation and few ECMs. This is similar to the configuration of newborn vocal folds.\n\n【66】Studies using high-frequency vibration bioreactors indicate that vibration signiﬁcantly affects matrix regulation in the SLP.\n\n【67】Design and validation of a bioreactor for engineering vocal fold tissues under combined tensile and vibrational stresses.\n\n【68】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【69】Vibration was found to signiﬁcantly increase messenger RNA expression levels of ﬁbronectin, matrix metalloproteinase-1, HA synthase 2, CD44, ﬁbromodulin, and decorin compared with samples without vibration. Collagen and elastin expression was relatively unchanged.\n\n【70】### Laryngeal Superstructure\n\n【71】Promising examples of bioengineered laryngeal structures have been reported. A porcine-derived xenogeneic ECM has been successfully used for reconstruction of the larynx in adult dogs.\n\n【72】Extracellular matrix as a scaffold for laryngeal reconstruction.\n\n【73】Reconstructed tissue 3 months after surgery showed the presence of a simple squamous epithelial lining, organized glandular structures deep to the epithelial layer, reconstructed thyroid cartilage, vasculature, and bundles of skeletal muscle.\n\n【74】Whole human larynges have also been successfully decellularized.\n\n【75】Development of bioengineered human larynx.\n\n【76】Minimal major histocompatibility complex immunostaining was observed, and only a few chondrocytes were detectable. Both bFGF and vascular endothelial growth factor were maintained. These are important for angiogenesis and neovascularization of the graft. The mechanical response of the cartilaginous laryngeal structures was similar to native tissues and reflected their different composition (elastic cartilage in the epiglottis and hyaline cartilage in cricoid and thyroid cartilages).\n\n【77】These studies represent a significant step toward successful laryngeal superstructure bioengineering. Once these techniques are refined, they might provide a functional partial laryngectomy reconstruction option or create a scaffold for total laryngeal regeneration. Although vocal fold motion has not yet been achieved, proper positioning and architecture might enable improved voicing and airway protection.\n\n【78】Applications in Craniofacial Reconstruction and Plastic Surgery\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【79】Regenerative applications in reconstructive surgery are rapidly expanding. Generally, efforts are either replicative or restorative and involve bone, cartilage, soft tissue, or a composite of these tissue types. This discussion focuses on bone and cartilage. Despite a long history of autograft, homograft, and xenograft use to shoulder the reconstructive burden, emerging trends in tissue engineering technology, such as biocompatible polymer construct, concomitant with the increasing safety and prevalence of stem cell therapies ushers forth a new era of facial restoration with less obligatory donor site morbidity, decreased graft rejection, decreased graft involution, and increased patient satisfaction. The challenge to researchers is how to integrate these in a safe, predictable, and efficacious manner.\n\n【80】### Bony Craniofacial Components\n\n【81】#### Induced Bone Restoration\n\n【82】With significant overlap in orthopedics, otolaryngology, oral and maxillofacial surgery, and neurosurgery, osteogenesis is perhaps the most widely explored regenerative field in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery. Effective replication of bone requires coordinated manipulation of cells, bioactive signaling molecules, and biomimetic, biodegradable scaffolds.\n\n【83】A representative disease process for which restorative regenerative therapies are being explored is osteoradionecrosis of the mandible, a devastating phenomenon encountered in 5% to 15% of patients after head and neck irradiation, where the bone becomes gradually replaced by fibrous tissue.\n\n【84】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【85】As the disease progresses, treatment initially calls for rigorous oral hygiene, followed by hyperbaric oxygen therapy or bone sequestrectomy, and then even osseous or osteocutaneous free tissue transfer.\n\n【86】In swine models, the use of BMSCs with hydroxyapatite/tricalcium phosphate as a carrier vehicle has shown promising reparative results with respect to damaged bone.\n\n【87】Mesenchymal stromal cell-based treatment of jaw osteoradionecrosis in Swine.\n\n【88】Likewise, initial results in limited human trials have shown equally impressive bone restoration with the use of platelet-poor plasma derivative fortified with mineral scaffold and autologous BMSCs, some studies even denoting inferior alveolar nerve recovery and resolution of fistulae.\n\n【89】#### Bone Replacement\n\n【90】Even more challenging are cases where bone is actually missing or needs to be removed, as in the instance of trauma, tumor, or congenital deformity. Examples of this include segmental mandibulectomy defects in the lower third of the face, maxillary and alveolar defects in the middle third, and calvarial defects in the upper third. These defects have to be replaced with a graft or implant, the success of which is measured in terms of osteoinduction, osteoconduction, and osseointegration. Osteoinduction is the ability of a graft to recruit immature cells to develop into preosteoblasts and, ultimately, new bone. Osteoconduction is bone growth on the surface of an implant or graft. Osseointegration is the stable anchorage achieved at the bone-implant interface.\n\n【91】To date, the standard of care when reconstructing segmental mandibulectomy defects is free tissue transfer. The reasons for this are multifactorial, but the overwhelming motivation is the 91% to 99% success rate of most free tissue transfer endeavors, regardless of the flap used.\n\n【92】Nonvascularized bone grafting from the iliac crest, fibula, radial forearm, scapula, and rib has been used for oromandibular reconstruction, with success rates ranging from 70% to 88%. The success of nonvascularized bone grafting dramatically declines for defects that are 5 to 6 cm in size, cross the midline, have had previous irradiation, and are subject to wound contamination.\n\n【93】Nonvascularized iliac bone grafts for mandibular reconstruction: requirements and limitations.\n\n【94】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【95】Although a variety of flaps are used for oromandibular reconstruction, the fibula free flap is the most frequently used because of low complications, ease of harvest, optional skin paddle, and an overwhelming 25 cm of dense cortical bone hospitable to dental implantation.\n\n【96】Despite the high success rate of free tissue transfer, the challenges faced by both surgeon and patient include increased operative time, donor site defect, comorbidities influencing ease of harvest (ie, vascular disease, limited anastomotic vessels secondary to previous surgery), increased length of hospitalization, and a re-exploration rate of 5% to 25%.\n\n【97】It is for these reasons that a regenerative solution would be ideal.\n\n【98】Advances in orthopedic polymer and ceramic technology along with improving safety and efficacy of stem cell therapies have brought forth new technologies for addressing critically sized defects, defined as “a large disruption in bony material that cannot spontaneously heal.”\n\n【99】There has been an influx of in vivo animal research using prefabricated scaffolds impregnated with growth factors such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), some of these scaffolds being implanted after in vitro seeding with BMSCs. For instance, Terheyden et al\n\n【100】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【101】Mandibular reconstruction with prefabricated vascularized bone grafts using recombinant human osteogenic protein-1: an experimental study in miniature pigs: part II. transplantation.\n\n【102】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【103】published 3 experiments using a minipig model for scaffold prefabrication and subsequent mandibular implantation. The investigators manufactured a scaffold composed of natural xenogeneic deproteinized bone soaked in BMP-7 and subsequently implanted this in the latissimus dorsi muscle for incubation. Microvascular transplant of this implant to a mandibular defect was then performed with success. Insights such as the need for a perforated scaffold to aid in vasculogenesis, the correlation between increased BMP-7 concentration and bone growth, and the optimal site and time for prefabricated flap incubation were gleaned from these animal studies.\n\n【104】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【105】Mandibular reconstruction with prefabricated vascularized bone grafts using recombinant human osteogenic protein-1: an experimental study in miniature pigs: part II. transplantation.\n\n【106】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【107】Similar mandibular studies have been performed in dogs using calcium phosphate ceramics and collagen membrane with delayed bone marrow grafting,\n\n【108】Mandibular segmental defect regenerated with macroporous biphasic calcium phosphate, collagen membrane, and bone marrow graft in dogs.\n\n【109】in rabbits using hydroxyapatite/polyamide with or without BMP-7–transduced mesenchymal stem cells,\n\n【110】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【111】Restoration of critical-sized defects in the rabbit mandible using porous nanohydroxyapatite-polyamide scaffolds.\n\n【112】and even in macaque monkeys using seeded hydroxyapatite-coated poly (E-caprolactone)\n\n【113】Segmental mandibular bone reconstruction with carbonate-substituted hydroxyapatite-coated modular endoprosthetic poly (E-caparolactone) scaffold in _Macaca fascicularis_ .\n\n【114】with varying levels of successful osteoinduction, osteoconduction, and osseointegration.\n\n【115】Maxillary defects are traditionally treated with obturation, local pedicled flaps (such as temporoparietal flaps), and nonosseous or osseous free tissue transfer, with fibula and scapula being the most common.\n\n【116】Cranioplasty for calvarial defects depends on autologous, nonvascularized bone grafting for small- to medium-sized cranial defects and on titanium mesh implants or polymethylmethacrylate for larger defects.\n\n【117】Tissue engineering animal studies for these sites have shown promising results.

Autologous cartilage is the gold standard. Allogenic materials have a risk of rejection, disease transmission, and resorption. Synthetic materials have a risk of immunogenicity, extrusion, and infection.\n\n【143】Typically, local autologous cartilage from the surgical site may be reshaped or reoriented to fit the needs of the patient. However, in the setting of previous surgery for septal defects or severe (grade III/IV) microtia, there may be a paucity of cartilage from the primary operative site, and an alternative harvest site (ie, costal cartilage) must be used, with added morbidity to the patient.\n\n【144】Bioengineered cartilage has the advantage of minimal donor site morbidity, large tissue availability, and the ability to be shaped to the individual needs of the patient. Cartilage cells can be harvested from an area such as the septum or auricle, expanded as a monolayer, seeded onto a scaffold to assume a 3-dimensional construct, and implanted. Growth and differentiation can be influenced by the introduction of growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor 1, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor (TGF), epidermal growth factor, and members of the BMP family. Exogenous stress can also influence growth.\n\n【145】In addition to the harvest of mature chondrocytes, the use of ASCs and BMSCs has also been explored.\n\n【146】Bioengineered constructs for nasal reconstruction have been investigated in human and animal studies. Yanaga et al\n\n【147】injected gelatinous chondroid matrix with chondrocytes derived from auricular cartilage into the nasal dorsa of 75 patients and monitored them for 6 years. This matrix turned from a soft gel to a hard neocartilage in 2 to 3 weeks and yielded satisfactory and long-lasting results.\n\n【148】Up to this point, however, animal studies have dominated the literature, with cell sources ranging from human nasal septal cartilage to rabbit BMSCs and scaffolding ranging from polyvinyl alcohol to poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA).\n\n【149】For example, PLGA scaffolding with rabbit BMSCs has been used to generate cartilage with precise nasal alar morphologic properties when implanted into nude mice.\n\n【150】Novel approach to engineer implantable nasal alar cartilage employing marrow precursor cell sheet qnd biodegradable scaffold.\n\n【151】Alginate hydrogels with human nasal cartilage chondrocytes have also been injected into nude mice to develop injectable cartilage for rhinoplasty.\n\n【152】When it comes to auricular cartilage, Vacanti’s “auriculosaurus” was perhaps the most dramatic introduction the public was given to potential human application of regenerative medicine. Polyglycolic acid scaffolds were fashioned into the 3-dimensional construct of a human ear, seeded with bovine chondrocytes, and implanted into pockets on the dorsa of 10 athymic mice.\n\n【153】Although successful with the retention of this complex structure and growth of new cartilage, most notable was the public reaction to the images of this “earmouse.” Using this as a jumping point, much research was conducted using synthetic polymers, particularly aliphatic polyesters, such as polyglycolic acid and PLGA, because they are Food and Drug Administration approved. Quite a few other animal studies have tested the utility of other scaffolds, including other synthetics, such as polylactic acid, poly- l \\-lactide acid, poly-ε-caprolactone, poly-4-hydroxybutyrate, and even fibrous collagen with coiled titanium wire. Hydrogels such as sodium alginate, pluronics, and fibrin gel polymer have also been trialed. Growth factors, including bFGF, FGF-2, TGF-β, and insulin-like growth factor 1, have shown a positive effect on cartilage growth and the potential for clinical application. Some of the greatest challenges faced by these constructs were shrinkage and distortion of this complex 3-dimensional shape.\n\n【154】The tissue-engineered auricle: past, present, and future.\n\n【155】Recently, successful attempts have even been made to oxidize commercially available, alloplastic, porous, high-density polyethylene implants (Medpor; Stryker) and subsequently spray these with a fibrin hydrogel seeded with expanded auricular cartilage cells. These implants showed no evidence of skin necrosis, implant exposure, or extrusion compared with nonseeded controls after implantation into the dorsum of athymic mice.\n\n【156】Auricular reconstruction using tissue-engineered alloplastic implants for improved clinical outcomes.\n\n【157】One human study used injection implantation of cultured chondrocytes into the subcutaneous pocket on the fascia of the lower abdomen. Six months later, the neocartilage block was surgically harvested and carved into an auricle for implantation. The 4 patients who had this done had stable implants with no evidence of rejection at follow-up ranging from 2 to 5 years.\n\n【158】Applications in Otology and Hearing\n-----------------------------------\n\n【159】Regenerative medicine applications for otology span the distance from the pinna, as discussed previously herein, to the auditory nerve. Although a comprehensive review of all the basic, translational, and human research for every application is too broad for the scope of this article, several representative areas are discussed.\n\n【160】### Tympanic Membrane\n\n【161】The current standard for closing tympanic membrane perforations is tympanoplasty using connective tissue, such as temporalis fascia or tragal perichondrium. Adipose tissue can sometimes be used if the perforation is of smaller size. In the hopes of encountering a regenerative solution, Hakuba et al\n\n【162】divided 24 guinea pigs into 3 groups of 8. Total tympanic membrane perforations were created in all the animals, with 8 acting as controls, 8 getting saline-gelatin hydrogel implants, and 8 getting bFGF-gelatin hydrogel implants. All the animals in the lattermost group developed a fibrous layer in addition to an epithelial and mucosal layer, with complete closure of the perforation.\n\n【163】This study is one of many to use bFGF as a bioactive molecule to aid in the closure of tympanic membrane perforations.\n\n【164】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【165】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【166】In addition to gelatin hydrogels, absorbable gelatin compressed sponge (Gelfoam, Pfizer), HA, decellularized dermis, chitosan, alginate, and even rice paper have been explored as potential scaffolds, with the bulk of the literature exploring epidermal growth factor and FGF families as bioactive molecules. Platelet-derived growth factor and TGF-β have also been used. Although many implants have been explored with timed release of bioactive molecules, relatively few have been implanted with seeded cells. It is theorized that progenitor cells in the remnant tympanic membrane are sufficient to populate the scaffold successfully.\n\n【167】### Ossicles\n\n【168】Although the small shape and relative tissue uniformity of the ossicles is enticing, the tenuous blood supply, hidden location, and availability of comparable prostheses have led to few studies on the topic. Nonetheless, several researchers have looked at various biocompatible and biodegradable polymer constructs. One such construct is a combined poly(propylene fumarate)/poly(propylene fumarate)-diacrylate scaffold fashioned into partial ossicular replacement prostheses. The porosity of these prostheses has been evaluated using micro–computed tomography, and their capability to support human mesenchymal stem cell growth has been quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated in vitro.\n\n【169】In addition, these tissue-engineered scaffolds have been compared with cadaveric ossicles in terms of immunopositivity, distribution of ECM molecules, and osteochondrogenic markers and have been found to be remarkably similar histologically.\n\n【170】Application of this technology to translational studies and human trials is forthcoming.\n\n【171】### Hair Cells\n\n【172】Stem cell therapy as a treatment for deafness has been thoroughly explored for the past decade, with hair cell and auditory neuron regeneration receiving the bulk of the attention.\n\n【173】During this period, attempts to convert stem cells into inner ear mechanosensitive hair cells and sensory neurons have encountered difficulty in phenotypic conversion and aggregation. In efforts to circumvent this issue, protocols that call for the stepwise differentiation of embryonic stem cells into hairlike cells have arisen. In a 2013 _Nature_ article, Koehler et al\n\n【174】describes such a protocol in which mouse embryonic stem cells are differentiated in 3-dimensional culture. Precise temporal control of BMP, TGF-β, and FGF resulted in prosensory cells emerging from otic placodes to generate hair cells bearing stereocilia bundles and kinocilium. These hairlike cells also manifested mechanosensitive properties, with synapses to sensory neurons also derived in the culture. This in vitro model of inner ear differentiation has exciting implications for future application.\n\n【175】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【176】Tissue regeneration in Oto-HNS is complicated by multiple tissue types and various specialized functions. However, significant advancements have been achieved in this field that promise to benefit millions of patients. Functional reconstruction of head and neck defects through bone and cartilage regeneration will decrease operative time and remove the need for a donor site. In turn, this will dramatically improve healing and patient suffering. Regeneration of auditory system components has the potential to restore hearing in those who have become deaf and may develop hearing in patients with congenital deafness. Engineering of laryngeal structures can allow patients to regain their identity through self-expression, to eat and breathe without difficulty, and to survive cancers that would have been otherwise terminal. Regenerative medicine is an exciting new field that has the potential to revolutionize disease management. Continued research and discovery are extending the boundaries of our capabilities. The possibilities for tissue regeneration are theoretically endless, limited only by our knowledge and imagination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 17:20:06", "endTime": "2024/08/26 17:20:20", "cost": 14.598}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:32", "update_time": "2024-08-26 01:20:20", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 01:20:05"}

Associations of grip strength and walking pace with CVD outcomes were investigated using Cox models adjusting for classical risk factors (as included in established risk scores), and predictive utility was determined by changes in C-index and categorical net reclassification index.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Over a median of 8.87 years of follow-up (interquartile range 3, 8.25-9.47 years), there were 7274 composite fatal/nonfatal events (on the basis of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association \\[ACC/AHA\\] outcome) and 1955 fatal events (on the basis of the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation \\[SCORE\\] risk score). Both grip strength and walking pace were inversely associated with CVD outcomes after adjusting for classical risk factors. Addition of grip strength (change in C-index: ACC/AHA, +0.0017; SCORE, +0.0047), usual walking pace (ACC/AHA, +0.0031; SCORE, +0.0130), and both combined (ACC/AHA, +0.0041; SCORE, +0.0148) improved the C-index and also improved the net reclassification index (grip, +0.55%; walking pace, +0.53%; combined, 1.12%).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The present study has found that the addition of grip strength or usual walking pace to existing risk scores results in improved CVD risk prediction, with an additive effect when both are added. As both these measures are cheap and easy to administer, these tools could provide an important addition to CVD risk screening, although further external validation is required.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ACC ( American College of Cardiology ), AHA ( American Heart Association ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), DBP ( diastolic blood pressure ), HDL ( high-density lipoprotein ), NRI ( net reclassification index ), SBP ( systolic blood pressure ), SCORE ( Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 09:41:37", "endTime": "2024/08/27 09:41:52", "cost": 14.832}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:32", "update_time": "2024-08-26 17:41:50", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 17:41:35"}

Clinical Pearls is designed with the 3 qualities of physician-learners in mind. First, we physicians enjoy learning from cases. Second, we like concise, practical points that we can use in our practice. Finally, we take pleasure in problem solving.\n\n【3】In the Clinical Pearls format, speakers present a number of short cases in their specialty to a general internal medicine audience. Each case is followed by a multiple-choice question answered live by attendees using an audience response system. The answer distribution is shown to attendees. The correct answer is then displayed and the speaker discusses teaching points, clarifying why one answer is most appropriate. Each case presentation ends with a Clinical Pearl, defined as a practical teaching point that is supported by the literature but generally not well-known to most internists.\n\n【4】Case 1\n------\n\n【5】A 32-year-old woman presents to your office with 2 days’ duration of rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, and a slight dry cough. She denies any fever, headache, or sore throat and has otherwise been well. She is not taking any medications. She works as a nurse in an outpatient internal medicine clinic, and her symptoms have been a considerable nuisance as she interacts with her patients. On examination, she appears generally well and is afebrile. She has moderate nasal edema and pale yellow mucus in both nasal passages. The pharynx appears normal, and there is no tenderness over the maxillary sinuses. There is no lymphadenopathy. Her lungs are clear.\n\n【6】### Question\n\n【7】*   **Which _one_ of the following intranasal topical therapy combinations would provide the _most effective_ relief of her symptoms in the next 7 days?**\n\n【8】    *   a.\n\n【9】        Zinc and oxymetazoline\n\n【10】    *   b.\n\n【11】        Ipratropium and oxymetazoline\n\n【12】    *   c.\n\n【13】        Ipratropium and zinc\n\n【14】    *   d.\n\n【15】        Fluticasone and oxymetazoline\n\n【16】    *   e.\n\n【17】        Fluticasone and ipratropium\n\n【18】### Discussion\n\n【19】The common cold is a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) for which there is no known cure, although the nasal symptoms may be substantially alleviated by topical therapies. The use of nasal ipratropium was assessed in a recent Cochrane Review that involved 7 randomized controlled trials of 2144 patients with acute viral URTI.\n\n【20】In a representative study of 943 patients, rhinorrhea scores decreased from a baseline of 6.5 (on a 1-10 scale) to 3.4 with treatment. In another trial of 410 patients, global improvement on day 5 was rated 81% with nasal ipratropium treatment compared with 65% in the placebo group and only 18% in a group that received no treatment. Adverse effects included primarily mild epistaxis and nasal dryness, both of which were judged tolerable by the study participants. The dose of ipratropium used in most studies was 2 sprays of the 0.06% solution in each nostril 4 times daily. The Cochrane reviewers concluded: “For people with the common cold, the existing evidence, which has some limitations, suggests that ipratropium bromide is likely to be effective in ameliorating rhinorrhoea.”\n\n【21】Nasal congestion was not affected by ipratropium treatment and can also be quite annoying for patients with URTI. A review of trials of intranasal xylometazoline (which is equivalent to oxymetazoline) for the common cold demonstrated a 34% reduction in symptom scores for nasal congestion (alone and combined with nasal ipratropium) compared with placebo.\n\n【22】Mild epistaxis was the only adverse effect. Treatment was used for up to 10 days, and there was no evidence of rhinitis medicamentosa in these trials (although it would be wise to avoid nasal decongestant use in patients with a history of rhinitis medicamentosa).\n\n【23】Trials of intranasal fluticasone in the common cold show a lack of benefit. Whereas oral zinc use has been found to modestly decrease the duration and severity of common cold symptoms,\n\n【24】intranasal zinc use has no efficacy (and may lead to permanent anosmia).\n\n【25】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【26】Intranasal ipratropium and oxymetazoline treatment reduces the symptoms of rhinorrhea and nasal congestion (respectively) in the common cold.\n\n【27】Case 2\n------\n\n【28】A 72-year-old woman presents with 4 months’ duration of right upper quadrant anterior abdominal pain. The pain is described as a “deep burning ache” that is continuous for most of the day and is worse as the day progresses. It is better with lying down and bothers her only at night if she lies on either side. It is unaffected by meals. She has no history of trauma and has not had a rash. She has no back pain. Her medical history is remarkable for a remote cholecystectomy and a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Her medications include alendronate, 70 mg by mouth once weekly; vitamin D, 1000 U daily; and a calcium supplement, 600 mg twice daily. Her examination reveals moderate kyphosis and tenderness in the right lateral abdomen. There is no mass or organomegaly and no rash.\n\n【29】### Question\n\n【30】*   **Which _one_ of the following would be _most likely_ to yield the diagnosis?**\n\n【31】    *   a.\n\n【32】        Check for the Murphy sign\n\n【33】    *   b.\n\n【34】        Perform the Carnett maneuver\n\n【35】    *   c.\n\n【36】        Measure the rib-pelvis distance\n\n【37】    *   d.\n\n【38】        Thoracic spine films\n\n【39】    *   e.\n\n【40】        Computed tomography of the abdomen\n\n【41】### Discussion\n\n【42】In patients with osteoporosis, the cumulative effects of vertebral compression fractures (which are frequently occult) often lead to a narrowing of the distance between the lowest anterior rib (the 10th rib, at its most inferior point, which is generally the midaxillary line) and the top of the iliac crest. This narrowing can be easily measured by fingerbreadths on examination with the patient in the seated or standing position. Even in asymptomatic patients, this measurement may be a helpful diagnostic clue to the presence of subclinical compression fractures. A distance of 2 fingerbreadths or less progressively increases the odds of such fractures, and at 4 fingerbreadths they would be virtually excluded (negative likelihood ratio of 0.1).\n\n【43】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【44】In this case, measurement of the rib-pelvis distance would provide a further clue to the mechanism of her abdominal pain. If the distance were 1 fingerbreadth or less, and the tenderness could be localized to the tip of the 10th rib (which is the lowest anterior rib), then a clinical diagnosis of iliocostal syndrome (aka “ribs on pelvis syndrome”) may be confidently established.\n\n【45】Treatment is aimed at postural training (to avoid contact of the rib with the pelvis) and other physical therapy modalities. If these are not effective, then a local injection of anesthetic and corticosteroid may sometimes be of benefit. In all cases, reassurance as to the benign nature of the diagnosis and avoidance of further testing is helpful. A similar syndrome of back and flank pain may develop in these patients in which the tip of the 12th rib contacts the top of the pelvis posteriorly.\n\n【46】The Carnett maneuver is a test for abdominal wall pain that involves tensing the abdominal muscles while palpating a tender spot to see whether the pain increases (which localizes the pain to the abdominal wall and helps exclude intra-abdominal causes). Although generally a useful maneuver, in this case the pain is farther lateral than in most cases of abdominal wall pain and the context is weighted more toward a rib-tip mechanism of pain. Thoracic spine films would simply confirm her kyphosis but would be unlikely to provide further insight into the cause of her abdominal pain. Findings on computed tomography of the abdomen would be expected to be normal in iliocostal syndrome and would be unnecessary in this case.\n\n【47】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【48】Patients with osteoporosis may develop chronic pain over the tip of the 10th rib where it contacts the pelvis, and this may be strongly suspected based on features of the clinical examination.\n\n【49】Case 3\n------\n\n【50】A 69-year-old man reports a history of nocturia that has become progressively more bothersome to him during the past couple of years. He now gets up 3 times at night to void and has trouble getting back to sleep each time. His daytime voiding pattern is normal (about 4 times during the day), and he has no hesitancy, decreased force of stream, urgency, or sensation of incomplete voiding. His wife has mentioned that he has snored loudly for many years, but she has not noticed any apnea. He has gained approximately 10 lb during the past year, but his fasting glucose level was recently only 92 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555). His only medication is lisinopril, 10 mg/d, for hypertension. His body mass index is 34 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), and his blood pressure is 136/76 mm Hg. Heart and lungs are normal. There is trace pitting edema at the ankles. His prostate is mildly enlarged (1+). Laboratory tests revealed normal serum sodium, potassium, creatinine, and calcium levels.\n\n【51】### Question\n\n【52】*   **Which _one_ of the following diagnoses _best_ explains his nocturia?**\n\n【53】    *   a.\n\n【54】        Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)\n\n【55】    *   b.\n\n【56】        Remobilization of peripheral edema\n\n【57】    *   c.\n\n【58】        Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH)\n\n【59】    *   d.\n\n【60】        Detrusor instability\n\n【61】    *   e.\n\n【62】        Superficial bladder cancer\n\n【63】### Discussion\n\n【64】Nocturia is a common symptom in older individuals (especially men) and may be associated with sleep disruption, poor quality of life, and falls at night. It generally arises in relation to reduced bladder capacity, increased nocturnal urine volume, or some combination of the two. Bladder causes include BPH, detrusor instability, and (less often) infection or tumor. Nocturnal urine volume in healthy individuals is much less than daytime output owing to decreased meal-related solute at night and a natural increase in vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). This circadian increase in nocturnal antidiuretic hormone is blunted in elderly individuals and is one of many factors predisposing them to nocturia. Specific diseases may also increase nocturnal urine volume, including diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, renal disease, and hypercalcemia.\n\n【65】More recently, OSA has been strongly linked to nocturia, which may occur in as many as 50% of patients with OSA.\n\n【66】Levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) have been documented to be significantly elevated in patients with OSA, and this is thought to be the mechanism of the nocturia. The elevated ANF level is most likely from right atrial stretch related to either the negative intrathoracic pressure directly, hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction, or some combination of the two. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy has been shown to improve nocturia in concert with reducing the levels of ANF. One representative trial of CPAP treatment resulted in nocturia decreasing from a mean of 2.5 times per night to 0.7 times per night. More than 70% of the patients reported good to excellent relief of their nocturia with CPAP treatment in that study.\n\n【67】Remobilization of edema on assuming the recumbent position at night is certainly a common cause of nocturia as well, but the present patient (even when examined toward the end of the day) does not have sufficient edema for that to be the cause. He has no daytime symptoms to suggest BPH, detrusor instability, or bladder neoplasm.\n\n【68】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【69】Nocturia is a common symptom in OSA and is substantially improved after initiation of CPAP therapy.\n\n【70】Case 4\n------\n\n【71】A 62-year-old woman is bothered by a sensation of dry eyes. This is more noticeable toward the end of the day and interferes at times with her ability to work on her computer. She has no dry mouth and is otherwise healthy. On examination, she has perhaps a slight decrease in tear production, but the eyes otherwise appear normal.\n\n【72】### Question\n\n【73】*   **In addition to the use of artificial tears, which _one_ of the following is _most_ likely to help her symptoms?**\n\n【74】    *   a.\n\n【75】        Evening primrose oil\n\n【76】    *   b.\n\n【77】        Vitamin E\n\n【78】    *   c.\n\n【79】        Vitamin D\n\n【80】    *   d.\n\n【81】        Horse chestnut extract\n\n【82】    *   e.\n\n【83】        Fish oil\n\n【84】### Discussion\n\n【85】Dry eyes are a common symptom and occur in up to 30% of those older than 50 years.\n\n【86】Mechanisms include decreased tear production and increased evaporative loss (often related to changes in the complex lipid composition of the outer layer of the tear film). Several medications have been implicated, including estrogens, antihistamines, anticholinergics, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The symptoms can be quite distracting in some cases and can have a major effect on visual acuity, social functioning, and workplace productivity. Most cases will not be related to Sjögren syndrome or other systemic diseases and may be treated symptomatically.\n\n【87】The first line of treatment in all cases is the use of artificial tears. In addition, fish oil may be beneficial. Several studies have established an association between decreased dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids and dry eye syndrome.\n\n【88】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【89】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【90】Correlations between nutrient intake and the polar lipid profiles of meibomian gland secretions in women with Sjogren's syndrome.\n\n【91】The mechanism is not entirely clear but is thought to relate to effects on meibomian gland oils. A recent small, randomized, double-blind trial of patients with mild to moderate dry eye syndrome used a daily dose of fish oil that contained 450 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid, 300 mg of docosahexaenoic acid, and 1000 mg of flaxseed oil. After 90 days, those in the treatment group had a notable increase in tear volume compared with the placebo group. Furthermore, 70% of the treated group had become asymptomatic compared with only 37% of those who took placebo.\n\n【92】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【93】Fish oil seems to be beneficial in treating the symptoms of dry eye syndrome.\n\n【94】Case 5\n------\n\n【95】Three months ago, a 64-year-old male accountant experienced an episode of left arm weakness lasting 15 minutes that was diagnosed as a transient ischemic attack (TIA). He was found to be in atrial fibrillation at that time. Findings on carotid ultrasonography were normal, and his echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function and no valvular disease. He has no cardiac symptoms and no additional remarkable medical history apart from hypertension. He takes lisinopril, 10 mg/d, and warfarin, 5 mg/d. His international normalized ratio has been consistently in the 2 to 3 range on his current dose of warfarin. His examination findings are normal except for an irregular heart rhythm at a rate of 84 beats/min. His blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. His father died of intracranial bleeding while taking warfarin, and the patient worries that he may be at risk for the same outcome. He has also been troubled by epistaxis and easy bruising and wonders just how important it is for him to continue taking anticoagulants.\n\n【96】### Question\n\n【97】*   **If the patient were to stop taking warfarin, what would be his risk of a stroke within the next year?**\n\n【98】    *   a.\n\n【99】        4%\n\n【100】    *   b.\n\n【101】        6%\n\n【102】    *   c.\n\n【103】        7.5%\n\n【104】    *   d.\n\n【105】        12%\n\n【106】    *   e.\n\n【107】        18%\n\n【108】### Discussion\n\n【109】The CHADS <sub>2 </sub> score is a well-validated method of estimating the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation\n\n【110】Anticoagulation therapy for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: how well do randomized trials translate into clinical practice?\n\n【111】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【112】and is enormously helpful in making decisions as to who should be undergoing long-term anticoagulation. It is also easy to use and remember, as patients are assigned 1 point each for congestive heart failure, hypertension, age 75 years and older, and diabetes mellitus and 2 points for stroke or TIA. However, there are currently 2 commonly used versions of the CHADS <sub>2 </sub> score, each derived from different populations with considerable interstudy variation in risk of stroke. This is illustrated in Table 1 , which shows rates of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation not undergoing anticoagulation from the 2 studies.\n\n【113】Table 1 Rates of Stroke in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation Not Undergoing Anticoagulation\n\n| CHADS 2 or CHA 2 DS 2 \\-VASc score | Annual stroke risk | Annual thromboembolism risk in the CHA 2 DS 2 \\-VASc cohort |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Lower-risk cohort | Higher-risk cohort |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0 | 0.49 | 1.9 | 0.8 |\n| 1 | 1.52 | 2.8 | 2.0 |\n| 2 | 2.50 | 4.0 | 3.7 |\n| 3 | 5.27 | 5.9 | 5.9 |\n| 4 | 6.02 | 8.5 | 9.3 |\n| 5 | 6.88 (5 or 6 combined) | 12.5 | 15.3 |\n| 6 | 6.88 (5 or 6 combined) | 18.2 | 19.7 |\n| 7 | NA | NA | 21.5 |\n| 8 | NA | NA | 22.4 |\n| 9 | NA | NA | 23.6 |\n\n【115】NA = not applicable.\n\n【116】The lower-risk cohort involved ambulatory patients with a mean age of 71 years,\n\n【117】and the original study (the higher-risk cohort) validating the index involved Medicare patients with a mean age of 81 years who had been hospitalized in the past year.\n\n【118】Although either index may be used in the appropriate setting, the higher-risk cohort is likely better matched to a substantial proportion of the frail elderly patients seen by many physicians.\n\n【119】The CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score adds another layer of precision by giving 1 point for age 65 to 74 years (and an additional point for age ≥75 years) and adding 1 point for vascular disease and female sex. This prediction rule has particular utility in identifying patients who are truly at low risk for stroke and for whom warfarin therapy may be safely withheld.\n\n【120】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【121】Validation of risk stratification schemes for predicting stroke and thromboembolism in patients with atrial fibrillation: nationwide cohort study.\n\n【122】For patients with a history of stroke or TIA, all of these models may underestimate the risk of recurrent stroke. The patient in this case has a CHADS <sub>2 </sub> and a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score of 3 (2 points for TIA and 1 point for hypertension) and would thus be estimated to have an annual stroke risk of approximately 5% to 6%. However, data from the placebo arm of the European Atrial Fibrillation Trial (a randomized trial of warfarin for secondary prevention after TIA or minor stroke) indicate that his actual stroke risk is closer to 12% per year.\n\n【123】In that study, the patients were randomized within 3 months after a TIA or stroke, but the curves for this increased risk in the placebo arm did not significantly flatten through up to 3 years of follow-up.\n\n【124】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【125】The CHADS <sub>2 </sub> and CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc scores provide an accurate estimation of stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation but considerably underestimate the risk in those who have experienced a TIA or stroke.\n\n【126】Case 6\n------\n\n【127】A 67-year-old woman undergoes osteoporosis screening using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and is found to have osteopenia.

However, evidence-based guidance has been lacking as to the optimal screening interval for repeating this testing based on the initial BMD result. This question has now been addressed by data from a cohort of women from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. Five thousand women 67 years and older without osteoporosis on their initial DXA screening were followed prospectively for up to 15 years. The DXA screening was repeated in years 2, 6, 8, 10, and 16. The outcome of interest was the time required for 10% of women to transition to a BMD of osteoporosis (T score ≤ –2.5) before incident hip/clinical vertebral fracture or before receiving treatment for osteoporosis. Patients were classified according to their baseline BMD, and the time required to reach this primary outcome was found to vary considerably .\n\n【142】Table 2 Time Required for 10% of Women to Transition to a BMD of Osteoporosis\n\n| Baseline osteopenia level | T score | Interval to reach a BMD of osteoporosis (y) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Normal | −1.00 or better | 17.4 |\n| Mild | −1.01 to –1.49 | 16.5 |\n| Moderate | −1.50 to –1.99 | 4.6 |\n| Advanced | −2.00 to –2.49 | 1.0 |\n\n【144】BMD = bone mineral density.\n\n【145】Age was a factor in determining the testing intervals. For example, although the overall testing interval was approximately 5 years for those with moderate osteopenia, for women 85 years and older it was closer to 3 years.\n\n【146】Bone-density testing interval and transition to osteoporosis in older women.\n\n【147】Although these data provide useful information to physicians regarding when to retest with DXA, it is important to remember that BMD is only one factor in determining risk of fracture. Treatment and testing decisions should ultimately be based on overall risk assessment (eg, Fracture Risk Assessment score). Women at higher risk (eg, corticosteroid users) need more frequent testing.\n\n【148】### Clinical Pearl\n\n【149】In most women who are at average risk for osteoporosis, the decision of when to retest the BMD may be based on the initial BMD result.

The sample included 2037 individuals aged 18 to 69 years: 488 African American women (24%), 686 white women (34%), 196 African American men (9%), and 667 white men (33%). Anthropometry included weight; hip circumference; waist circumference; waist-hip, waist-height, and weight-height ratios; body adiposity index; and body mass index. Body fat and percentage of fat were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and abdominal visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured by computed tomography. Bivariate correlations, logistic regression models, and receiver operator characteristic curves were used, and analyses were stratified by sex and race.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In each sex-by-race group, all anthropometric measures were highly correlated with percentage of fat, fat mass, and subcutaneous adipose tissue and moderately correlated with visceral adipose tissue, with the exception of the waist-hip ratio. The odds of having an elevated cardiometabolic risk were increased more than 2-fold per SD increase for most anthropometric variables, and the areas under the curve for each anthropometric measure were significantly greater than 0.5.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Several common anthropometric measures were moderately to highly correlated with total body fat, abdominal fat, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in a biracial sample of women and men.

Antibiotic resistance results in worse outcomes and higher costs. In the outpatient setting, internists too frequently encounter patients with infections that have no effective oral options for treatment.\n\n【1】The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2.8 million antibiotic-resistant infections occur in the United States each year and result in approximately 35,000 deaths.\n\n【2】Health care costs attributed to antibiotic-resistant infections surpass 2 billion dollars annually.\n\n【3】Outpatient clinicians contribute to the increase in antibiotic resistance through antibiotic overuse: the prescribing of antibiotics when not medically necessary, for durations longer than necessary, and the use of broader-spectrum antibiotics when narrower-spectrum agents would be equally, and often more, effective.\n\n【4】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【5】Understanding the mechanisms and drivers of antimicrobial resistance.\n\n【6】Studies estimate that more than 12% of all ambulatory visits in the United States result in an antibiotic prescription, and 23% to 30% of these prescriptions are “inappropriate” based on their assigned diagnosis.\n\n【7】Prevalence of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions among US ambulatory care visits, 2010–2011.\n\n【8】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【9】Increasing attention has been paid to antibiotic stewardship efforts in the outpatient setting: in 2016, the CDC outlined core elements of outpatient antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs).\n\n【10】In 2020, the Joint Commission, a nonprofit accreditation organization, implemented ASP requirements for outpatient accreditation.\n\n【11】Behavioral motivations for antibiotic overuse are complex and have not been a focus of medical research until recently. Three motivations that affect outpatient clinician practice warrant further attention: 1) risk aversion, 2) action bias, and 3) patient satisfaction . Existing strategies to address overuse have taken many forms, including clinician education, prospective audit-and-feedback programs, and preauthorization for restricted antibiotics.\n\n【12】Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.\n\n【13】These interventions have been primarily used in the inpatient setting and are more difficult to implement in outpatient practices. Novel strategies focused on restructuring the decision-making environment, a practice known as choice architecture, may play a complementary role in addressing antibiotic overuse without reducing clinician autonomy. These methods show promise as effective strategies in the current campaign against antibiotic resistance.\n\n【14】Table Concepts From Behavioral Economics and Their Application to Antibiotic Overuse\n\n| Concept | Description | Application to antibiotic use |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Contributors to antibiotic overuse |  |  |\n| Immediacy effect and the tragedy of the commons | Users are drawn to decisions that produce individualized benefits while delaying risks and distributing them over the entire system. | Clinicians use broad-spectrum antibiotics because the potential harms of nontreatment of a bacterial infection would be directly borne by the patient and clinician whereas the harms of antibiotic overuse are, in the case of drug resistance, distributed over the entire medical system. |\n\n| Solutions to antibiotic overuse based on choice architecture |  |  |\n\n【17】CAP, community-acquired pneumonia; EMR, electronic medical record.\n\n【18】Clinician Practices Regarding Antibiotic Prescribing\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】### Risk Aversion: Immediacy Effect and the Tragedy of the Commons\n\n【20】Immediacy effect refers to a powerful motivator of human behavior in which individuals value immediate consequences more strongly than delayed consequences. The immediacy effect motivates antibiotic overuse when a clinician is more concerned about the immediate risks of untreated infection than the long-term risks of antibiotic resistance. In circumstances where a patient's syndrome is caused by bacterial infection, the potential harms of nontreatment (ie, worsening infection, hospitalization, and sepsis) become apparent in the short-term and are directly borne by the patient, family, physician, and care team. Conversely, the harms of antibiotic overuse are often neither immediate nor visible. In the case of drug resistance, the harms are not only delayed but also distributed over the entire medical system. Therefore, even when the likelihood of bacterial infection is low, clinicians who only consider their immediate circumstances have little incentive to restrict antibiotic use: they accrue the benefits of antibiotic overuse by averting the risk of clinical decompensation no matter how small that risk may actually be, while the harms of antibiotic overuse are delayed and also distributed to the remainder of the population and medical system (ie, antibiotic resistance).\n\n【21】This asymmetric distribution of benefits and risks between individual and system is conceptualized in economics as the “tragedy of the commons.” In the classic description of this concept, a group of self-interested farmers share the availability of a collective resource, such as the land on which their animals graze.\n\n【22】The “tragedy” lies in the subsequent depletion of that resource because each farmer stands to individually benefit from overgrazing while the harmful consequence of resource loss is distributed equally among participants. In the case of antibiotic resistance, it is understandably difficult for individual clinicians to appreciate how each antibiotic they prescribe contributes to the global problem of drug-resistant infections. However, as a collective, their decisions are detrimental to the whole system.\n\n【23】### Discomfort With Uncertainty: Action Bias and Indication Creep\n\n【24】A second contributor to antibiotic overuse is action bias, which is the tendency for individuals to take an action, even when it is not appropriate in the specific situation, because action is perceived as more beneficial than inaction.\n\n【25】In antibiotic overuse, this may occur most often in times of diagnostic uncertainty. For example, an elderly patient presenting with nonspecific symptoms and pyuria or bacteriuria may be misclassified as having a urinary tract infection even though asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria are common in elderly populations. Clinicians are inclined to assign a misdiagnosis with a proven treatment rather than settle in an alternative state of diagnostic uncertainty or with a diagnosis that has no recommended therapy.\n\n【26】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【27】Some investigators also refer to this phenomenon as indication creep: when we take interventions with proven benefits in select patient populations and apply them to other patient groups.\n\n【28】Indication creep has been evident when antibiotic use is associated with a quality performance measure. In 2003, the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommended that patients with pneumonia receive antibiotics within 4 hours of presentation.\n\n【29】Update of practice guidelines for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adults.\n\n【30】This practice became a national quality measure and was linked to reimbursement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Subsequently, patients who presented to emergency departments and urgent care centers with respiratory complaints were frequently placed into a clinical treatment pathway for community-acquired pneumonia, which included prompt administration of antibiotics. Two important studies investigated the effect of this recommendation on antibiotic use. One study found that patients with an emergency department diagnosis of pneumonia were 39% less likely to meet standard criteria for a diagnosis of pneumonia.\n\n【31】Another study found that after implementation of these quality measures, patients who received antibiotics as part of an initial admission diagnosis of pneumonia were more frequently discharged with a separate, often noninfectious, diagnosis for their original symptoms: the final diagnosis rate of pneumonia decreased from 75.9% to 58.9%.\n\n【32】Together, these studies suggest that clinicians became less accurate in diagnosing pneumonia after implementation of this quality measure with a concomitant increase in antibiotic overuse. These findings motivated a change in the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines where the recommendation for antibiotics within 4 hours of presentation was instead generalized to endorse administration at the time of pneumonia diagnosis without a specified target time.\n\n【33】Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults.\n\n【34】They highlight how action bias and indication creep can result in unintended consequences of antibiotic recommendations in clinical practice guidelines.\n\n【35】### Patient Satisfaction\n\n【36】Another powerful motivator for antibiotic overuse is clinician desire to earn patient satisfaction. During clinical encounters, patients may perceive receipt of a prescription drug as validation of the illness experience, recognition of symptom severity, and evidence that they were adequately heard by their clinician during the encounter.\n\n【37】Studies show that physicians feel compelled to prescribe antibiotics when they believe that it is within the patient expectations.\n\n【38】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【39】In telemedicine encounters for upper respiratory tract infections, for instance, antibiotic prescriptions are associated with higher patient satisfaction scores.\n\n【40】This finding is particularly concerning given the substantial shift from in-person to virtual outpatient encounters this year related to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.\n\n【41】In the outpatient setting, the need to maintain patient satisfaction combines with compelling time pressures to make antibiotic prescription an expedient option during periods of high patient volume. Qualitative studies of physician prescribing for upper respiratory tract infections found that physicians may opt for antibiotic prescriptions when they are unable to provide lengthy counseling on more conservative options for symptom management.\n\n【42】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【43】Emphasis on patient satisfaction in outpatient quality measures, reimbursement models, and promotion also combine to motivate clinician behavior in favor of antibiotic overuse.\n\n【44】Potential Solutions to Reduce Antibiotic Resistance\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【45】Strategies that have been emphasized in the fight against antibiotic resistance include the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic interventions (such as point-of-care technologies), clinician education, prospective audit-and-feedback, and preauthorization for restricted antibiotics.\n\n【46】Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.\n\n【47】However, these strategies are more easily implemented in hospitals than in outpatient practices. They will also have limited success unless the behavioral determinants of antibiotic overuse are also addressed at the clinician level. For example, the use of rapid diagnostic tests to reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics will only prove effective if implemented in concert with informed and rational decision-making by clinicians interpreting the tests.\n\n【48】### Choice Architecture: Effective Methods to Changing Prescriber Behavior\n\n【49】A successful method of changing physician behavior may lie in the deliberate presentation of choices within the decision-making environment. This concept, known as choice architecture, has successfully shaped behavior in diverse settings, and does not force practitioners into prespecified decisions.\n\n【50】Clinical care often uses components of choice architecture . For example, many ASPs compare clinicians' antibiotic prescription habits with colleagues in the same clinical practice. This makes use of relative social ranking, a phenomenon where individuals, in times of uncertainty, can be influenced to make choices that compare more favorably to their peers. One study randomized primary care practices to email clinicians with their rates of antibiotic prescription for uncomplicated upper respiratory tract infections, comparing them to top-performing practitioners within the same practice.\n\n【51】Effect of behavioral interventions on inappropriate antibiotic prescribing among primary care practices: a randomized clinical trial.\n\n【52】Study investigators found that this intervention lowered the rate of antibiotic prescriptions by 5% compared with control practices. Notably, peer comparisons are most effective when comparison is made with top-performing practitioners rather than the mean performance, because the latter comparison can paradoxically worsen the behavior of top performers by converging all practitioners towards the mean.\n\n【53】In explicitly comparing a clinician's practice to their top-performing peers, it is possible that this strategy counteracts the general aversion to risk that motivates antibiotic overuse.\n\n【54】Many concepts from choice architecture can be incorporated as interventions into the electronic medical record. For example, clinicians are less likely to resort to cognitive biases when they are asked to articulate the rationale for their decisions, a concept known as accountable justification. Physicians who are required to provide free-text justifications for antibiotic indication in the electronic medical record use 7% fewer antibiotics compared with controls.\n\n【55】Effect of behavioral interventions on inappropriate antibiotic prescribing among primary care practices: a randomized clinical trial.\n\n【56】If implemented effectively, accountable justification may overcome action bias as clinicians would be prompted to consider whether their interventions are truly indicated in that specific clinical scenario.\n\n【57】Similarly, the inclination for decision-makers to rely on default practices can be harnessed to address antibiotic overuse. Clinicians may be more likely to choose narrower antibiotics for certain indications when those antibiotics are presented as the default options in electronic ordering systems. One study found that differential framing of broad and narrow-spectrum antibiotics in clinical vignettes reduced selections for broad-spectrum antibiotics for the same clinical indications by up to 11%.\n\n【58】Nudging physician prescription decisions by partitioning the order set: results of a vignette-based study.\n\n【59】An effective behavioral strategy that aligns future actions with current preferences is pre-commitment, where subjects publicly state their values or preferences before entering a choice environment. In one randomized study, outpatient primary care practices that included a poster in an examination room displaying a public commitment to judicious antibiotic prescriptions showed a 20% reduction in antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections during influenza season.\n\n【60】Nudging guideline-concordant antibiotic prescribing: a randomized clinical trial.\n\n【61】This strategy may be especially effective in outpatient practices where patient satisfaction and patient expectations may be motivating antibiotic overuse.\n\n【62】Implementation of choice architecture into outpatient practice has its challenges. Electronic medical record-based interventions will need to be tailored to specific practice environments and patient populations. Perception of patient expectation and satisfaction may still drive antibiotic overuse, particularly in telemedicine settings. Finally, outpatient practices will need to monitor patient safety to ensure that appropriate antibiotic use is not affected by changes in clinician behavior. Addressing these and future challenges to effectively achieve antibiotic stewardship goals will require ongoing attention paid by outpatient clinical leadership.\n\n【63】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【64】The clinical and economic burden of antibiotic resistance has reached a crisis point in the United States. Clinician behavior is motivated by a complex intersection of incentives; risk aversion, action bias, and patient satisfaction are three major factors that contribute to antibiotic overuse. An improved understanding of the behavioral contributions to antibiotic overuse may lead us to strategies of behavior change that do not reduce clinician autonomy. These strategies involve restructuring the clinical decision-making environment for more judicious antibiotic use. As medical practices implement CDC-recommended elements of outpatient ASP, clinical leaders should incorporate evidence-based behavioral strategies into their program. In particular, attention should be paid to interventions that make use of relative social ranking, accountable justification, default practices, and pre-commitment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:30:10", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:31:01", "cost": 51.331}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:31", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:31:01", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:30:09"}

Elevated liver and pancreatic enzyme levels indicated alcoholic hepatitis and pancreatitis, which were confirmed by abdominal computed tomography (CT). Results of initial electrocardiography and cardiac enzyme analysis, including troponin level, were normal. Shortly after admission, the patient developed dyspnea and chest pain. Repeated electrocardiography showed no serious ST-T abnormalities besides mild QTc prolongation, but repeated blood tests revealed an elevated troponin T level of 0.28 ng/mL (reference range, <0.1 ng/mL). The patient was initially treated with heparin and aspirin. Echocardiography and left ventriculography performed the day after onset of symptoms revealed akinesia of the mid and basal portions of the left ventricle with hyperkinesia of the apex .

Left, Right anterior oblique view of the left coronary artery. Right, Anteroposterior view of the right coronary artery.\n\n【15】The patient received standard heart failure treatment consisting of lisinopril and carvedilol. Follow-up electrocardiography showed a mild nonsignificant ST-segment elevation in leads V <sub>4 </sub> through V <sub>6 </sub> followed by an inversion of the T waves in the inferior and anterolateral leads. The maximum creatine kinase level was 786 U/L. Urinary norepinephrine excretion was increased to 145 μg/24 h (reference range, <80 μg/24 h) with normal metanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid excretion. Echocardiography performed 2 weeks after admission showed normalization of left ventricular systolic function with only mild residual mitral insufficiency. The patient remained asymptomatic after 3 months of follow-up. Although initial viral serology was suggestive of recent coxsackievirus B3 infection, asecond serologic evaluation 6 weeks later showed no major increase in the viral antibody titer.\n\n【16】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【17】We report a case of acute heart injury mimicking an acute coronary syndrome with complete and rapid recovery in the setting of alcoholic pancreatitis. Major obstructive coronary artery disease was excluded by coronary angiography. Urinary metanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid excretion were normal, and abdominal CT showed no suprarenalmass suggestive of pheochromocytoma. Left ventriculography during the acute phase showed a peculiar regional systolic dysfunction with basal akinesia and apical hyperkinesia. Endomyocardial biopsy to exclude the possibility of myocarditis was not performed. However, serial viral titer analysis showed no substantial increase after 6 weeks.\n\n【18】Several features of this case have also been described in stress-induced Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, including physiological or emotional stress acting as a trigger, a small increase in cardiac enzymes, serial electrocardiographic changes, striking regional dysfunction not corresponding to a single coronary artery territory, absence of major coronary artery stenosis, and rapid recovery. Recent case reports have described patients with a syndrome mimicking Takotsubo cardiomyopathy but with involvement of regions other than the apex, suggesting a new or variant clinical entity. One article described 4 patients with clinical syndromes resembling Takotsubo cardiomyopathy but with different wall motion abnormalities. Two of these patients had akinesia of the mid and basal portions of the left ventricle, as was the case in our patient, one triggered by colonoscopy and one by neck pain.\n\n【19】Variant form of the acute apical ballooning syndrome (takotsubo cardiomyopathy): observations on a novel entity \\[letter\\].\n\n【20】The other patients had anterolateral or posterobasal hypokinesia. Another article described a 64-year-old man with a history of bronchial asthma who was hospitalized because of dyspnea. Left ventriculography revealed midventricular ballooning consisting of hyperkinesia of the apex and the basal portions of the left ventricle and akinesia of the mid portions. Coronary stenosis was absent, and left ventricular function returned to normal on day 15.\n\n【21】The same finding of midventricular ballooning has also been described in a series of 4 North American Caucasian women.\n\n【22】Transient midventricular ballooning syndrome. a new variant.\n\n【23】Although the cause of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is unknown, exaggerated sympathetic stimulation has been proposed as a central factor in the pathophysiology. Of note, urinary catecholamines were also slightly increased in our patient. Patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy have higher catecholamine levels than do patients with myocardial infarction with the same Killip class.\n\n【24】Neurohumoral features of myocardial stunning due to sudden emotional stress.\n\n【25】Also, severe generalized hypokinesia and Takotsubo left ventricular dysfunction have been described in pheochromocytoma-related cardiomyopathy, suggesting a similar pathophysiology.\n\n【26】Regional differences in adrenergic sensitivity or innervation could then explain different clinical presentations with other regions of hypokinesia. A recent report of a pheochromocytoma-related cardiomyopathy with an inverted Takotsubo contractile pattern supports this hypothesis.\n\n【27】Subarachnoid hemorrhage is another condition in which regional wall motion abnormalities occur. This is also believed to be caused by surges in catecholamine levels. A recent article described 4 patients with acute cerebral disorders presenting with transient left ventricular basal dysfunction and apical sparing.\n\n【28】Transient left ventricular basal dysfunction without coronary stenosis in acute cerebral disorders: a novel heart syndrome (inverted Takotsubo).\n\n【29】One other recent report described transient left ventricular apical ballooning after cocaine use, which also suggests a common catecholamine link.\n\n【30】Ibanez et al\n\n【31】have considered coronary thrombosis as the cause of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Occlusion of the proximal or middle portion of a left anterior descending (LAD) artery that “wraps around” the apex supplying a large portion of the inferior left ventricular wall could result in the same regional dysfunction as that of Takotsubo syndrome. Rapid resolution of thrombus by endogenous fibrinolysis and antithrombotics before angiography could explain the absence of coronary stenosis on coronary angiography and the quick resolution of ventricular dysfunction. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that 11 patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy all had an LAD artery with a long recurrent segment.\n\n【32】Tako-tsubo syndrome associated with a long course of the left anterior descending coronary artery along the apical diaphragmatic surface of the left ventricle \\[in Spanish\\].\n\n【33】A recent intravascular ultrasound study of patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy by the same authors showed disrupted eccentric atherosclerotic plaque in the middle portion of the LAD artery that was not visible on coronary angiography.\n\n【34】Coronary angiography in our patient also showed an LAD artery that “wrapped” around the apex . However, the regional akinesia did not correspond with a single coronary artery, suggesting that apical-sparing stress-induced cardiomyopathy is not an aborted myocardial infarction.\n\n【35】Finally, some investigators have suggested that septal thickening is a primordial factor in the pathophysiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy by dividing the left ventricle into 2 chambers, resulting in ballooning of the apex provided a secondary triggering factor such as dehydration or increased catecholamine levels is present.\n\n【36】This would also imply that the etiology of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is different from that of apical-sparing cardiomyopathy.\n\n【37】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【38】Stress-induced cardiomyopathy remains an interesting but enigmatic entity. It seems reasonable to propose that the pathophysiology of this reversible cardiomyopathy with apical sparing seen in our patient is similar to that of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and the cardiomyopathy related to pheochromocytomas or intracranial disorders. This concept supports the role of catecholamine cardiotoxicity or catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction with regional differences in innervation or sensitivity explaining different regional dysfunction. Stress-induced cardiomyopathy could also be a heterogeneous disorder, with coronary thrombosis or septal thickening being primordial in a number of patients. Further research is needed to elucidate this problem, beginning with correctly identifying these patients within the large group of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Although the apical ballooning syndrome has gained attention during the past few years, alternative presentations of stress cardiomyopathy are possibly under-recognized. Coronary angiography and, if available, intravascular ultrasonography should be performed as soon as possible in such patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:54:12", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:55:03", "cost": 50.359}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:31", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:55:02", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:54:12"}

Most experts hold that traumatic events—those experienced as overwhelmingly terrifying and often life-threatening—are remembered very well; however, traumatic dissociative amnesia theorists disagree. Although acknowledging that traumatic events are usually memorable, these theorists nevertheless claim that a sizable minority of survivors are incapable of remembering their trauma. That is, the memory is stored but dissociated (or “repressed”) from awareness. However, the evidence that these theorists adduce in support of the concept of traumatic dissociative amnesia is subject to other, more plausible interpretations. The purpose of this review is to dispel confusion regarding the controversial notion of dissociated (or repressed) memory for trauma and to show how people can recall memories of long-forgotten sexual abuse without these memories first having been repressed.\n\n【1】CSA ( childhood sexual abuse ), PTSD ( posttraumatic stress disorder )\n\n【2】**A** re traumatic experiences engraved in memory? Or does the mind protect itself by banishing memories of trauma from awareness? These questions lie at the heart of the bitter controversy regarding the reality of dissociated (or “repressed”) memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA).\n\n【3】A substantial body of evidence indicates that documented traumatic experiences—those triggering terror and fear of impending death—are seldom, if ever, truly inaccessible to awareness.\n\n【4】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【5】Release of stress hormones during trauma fosters consolidation of the experience, rendering it relatively resistant to forgetting.\n\n【6】Nevertheless, the mind does not operate like a videotape recorder, infallibly capturing all our sensory impressions. Even memories of trauma may change over time.\n\n【7】However, when the details change or fade, trauma survivors still remember the gist of their experience remarkably well.\n\n【8】It is easy to see how the capacity for remembering trauma might constitute an evolutionary adaptation, whereas a capacity for forgetting it would seemingly imperil survival.\n\n【9】This consensus notwithstanding, traumatic dissociative amnesia theorists hold that a sizable minority of survivors develop “massive repression”\n\n【10】of their trauma, making it difficult for them to recall it until it is safe to do so, often many years later. In fact, some believe that the more traumatic an event is, the more likely some survivors will be unable to remember it. As Brown et al\n\n【11】argued, when emotional material reaches the point of being traumatic in intensity—something that cannot be replicated in artificial laboratories—in a certain subpopulation of individuals, material that is too intense may not be able to be consciously processed and so may become unconscious and amnesic.\n\n【12】The traumatic dissociative amnesia theorists believe that these survivors are unable, not merely reluctant, to recall their trauma, precisely because it was so emotionally distressing. Moreover, they affirm that dissociated trauma must be remembered for healing to occur\n\n【13】and that special techniques are sometimes needed to help patients recover the traumatic memories they are otherwise unable to recall. As Brown et al\n\n【14】put it, “Because some survivors of sexual abuse will repress their memories by dissociating them from consciousness, hypnosis can be very valuable in retrieving these memories. Indeed, for some survivors, hypnosis may provide the only avenue to the repressed memories.” These beliefs provided the theoretical rationale for what critics have called _recovered memory therapy_ . Critics worried that suggestive methods, such as hypnosis for memory retrieval, increased the risk of patients developing false memories of abuse.\n\n【15】Traumatic dissociative amnesia theorists have not ignored the clinical science of memory. Instead they have often misinterpreted the very studies they cite in support of the alleged phenomenon of dissociated memory of trauma (discussed in detail in published reviews\n\n【16】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【17】). The purpose of this article is to dispel confusion regarding the relevant studies and to provide an account of how some people may recall long-forgotten memories of CSA without having first repressed them.\n\n【18】Everyday Forgetfulness Is Not Traumatic Dissociative Amnesia\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】After experiencing a trauma, some survivors report problems with memory.\n\n【20】These difficulties have been misinterpreted as evidence for traumatic dissociative amnesia.\n\n【21】In reality, this kind of memory problem refers to everyday forgetfulness that emerges in the wake of trauma; it has nothing to do with difficulty remembering the trauma itself. Indeed, intrusive recollection of the trauma may interfere with everyday memory functioning. Everyday memory problems that develop _after_ a trauma must not be confused with amnesia _for_ the trauma.\n\n【22】Organic Amnesia Is Not Traumatic Dissociative Amnesia\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Some traumatic dissociative amnesia theorists have cited cases of organic amnesia as relevant to repression of traumatic memory. Brown et al <sup>7pp609–610 </sup> describe a finding by Dollinger\n\n【24】that “two of the 38 children studied after watching lightning strike and kill a playmate had no memory of the event.” However, Brown et al failed to mention that both amnesic children had also been struck by side flashes from the main lightning bolt, knocked unconscious, and nearly killed. The other children present during the disaster who were not struck by lightning remembered the event all too well. Therefore, amnesia in the 2 children struck by the lightning resulted from the physical, not psychic, aspects of their trauma. One must not confuse amnesia resulting from direct physical insult to the brain with traumatic dissociative amnesia.\n\n【25】Psychogenic Amnesia Is Not Traumatic Dissociative Amnesia\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Psychogenic amnesia is an unusual syndrome characterized by sudden, massive retrograde memory loss that cannot be attributed to physical damage to the brain.\n\n【27】The syndrome sometimes emerges after the person has experienced a stressful event, but these events are often relatively mundane (eg, romantic disappointment). Whether a retrospectively identified stressor that preceded the onset of amnesia was, in fact, its cause is also unclear.\n\n【28】Psychogenic amnesia should not be confused with a selective inability to remember a specific traumatic event. <sup>1pp186–189 </sup> Psychogenic amnesia involves complete memory loss, including loss of one's personal identity. Fortunately, it rarely lasts for more than a few weeks, usually remitting without therapeutic intervention. Finally, it is termed _psychogenic_ amnesia not because we know it has a psychological cause, but because we have not identified an organic cause.\n\n【29】Incomplete Encoding Is Not Traumatic Dissociative Amnesia\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【30】One of the diagnostic criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an “inability to recall an important aspect of the trauma.”\n\n【31】Unfortunately, the meaning of this criterion is ambiguous. The ambiguity arises because not every aspect of an experience, including a traumatic one, is encoded into memory. Under conditions of intense emotional arousal, people usually attend to the central features of the event at the expense of the peripheral features. If survivors cannot recall an aspect of the trauma, it is difficult to tell whether they encoded it but cannot recall it or whether they never encoded it in the first place. For example, persons mugged at gunpoint sometimes are unable to recall the face of their assailant, not because they have amnesia but because their attention was so fixed on the gun that they never encoded the assailant's face. Accordingly, incomplete encoding must not be confused with traumatic dissociative amnesia.\n\n【32】Nondisclosure Is Not Traumatic Dissociative Amnesia\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Some known abuse survivors fail to acknowledge their abuse when questioned by survey interviewers.\n\n【34】However, it is often unclear whether the survivors cannot recall abuse or whether they are merely reluctant to disclose it to a stranger conducting a survey. In one small but important study, researchers recontacted respondents who had not disclosed abuse during a previous interview and found that none of them had forgotten their (physical) abuse.\n\n【35】For various reasons (eg, dislike of the interviewer), each nondisclosing participant had been unwilling to acknowledge the maltreatment. Accordingly, if someone fails to disclose abuse, one cannot automatically assume that the person is unable to remember it.\n\n【36】Childhood Amnesia Is Not Traumatic Dissociative Amnesia\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【37】People can remember little of their lives before the age of 4 or 5 years. Neurocognitive changes in language capacity and brain maturation make it very difficult for older children and adults to recall events encoded during their preschool years. Accordingly, if a person cannot recall an episode of molestation from the preschool years,\n\n【38】one should not assume its inaccessibility is attributable to traumatic dissociative amnesia. Because of normal childhood amnesia, nearly all events from these years will be lost forever.\n\n【39】Dissociation During a Trauma Is Not the Same as Being Unable to Remember the Trauma Later\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【40】The concept of dissociation is extremely broad, embracing diverse processes. All of the following have been deemed dissociative: the sense of being disconnected from one's body (depersonalization), derealization, the sense that time is slowing down, emotional numbing, the inability to remember parts of the trauma, and the ability to remember trauma all too well (ie, flashbacks). However, the experience of depersonalization does not prevent the survivor from recalling the trauma later. Indeed, dissociation during the trauma predicts later PTSD,\n\n【41】a disorder characterized by vivid, intrusive recollections of the trauma.\n\n【42】Not Thinking About Something for a Long Time Is Not Traumatic Dissociative Amnesia\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【43】The most common mistake made by traumatic dissociative amnesia theorists is to confuse not thinking about something with an inability to remember it. In one influential questionnaire study, researchers noted that nearly 60% of adult patients who reported having been sexually abused as children answered affirmatively when questioned whether there had ever been a time that they could not remember the molestation.\n\n【44】These results have been interpreted as evidence for sexual abuse-related repression.\n\n【45】By replying affirmatively to this question, patients indicated that they had spent time trying unsuccessfully to remember their abuse. But if they had blocked out all memories of the abuse, why would they try to recall it in the first place? Most likely, respondents interpret such questions as meaning, “Has there ever been a time when you did not think about your abuse?” But not thinking about one's abuse is not the same as being unable to recall it, and it is the inability to recall that counts as amnesia. Had they been asked about past abuse, these patients may well have recalled it.\n\n【46】Distinguishing between not thinking about something for a long time vs being unable to remember it is not merely a semantic quibble. Indeed, it has immense clinical implications. If patients have not thought about their abuse in many years, then questions during an intake interview are likely to prompt recollection. In contrast, if therapists believe that patients often experience traumatic dissociative amnesia, then a mere question or two should not unlock the memories. If therapists believe that recalling repressed or dissociated memories is vital for healing, they may embark on a treatment regimen that could foster false memories of abuse.\n\n【47】Experimental Cognitive Research\n-------------------------------\n\n【48】If adult survivors of CSA are prone to repress, dissociate, or otherwise forget their abuse, then one might be able to detect this heightened forgetting skill in the laboratory. My colleagues and I have conducted experiments designed to test for the presence of cognitive mechanisms that ought to be operative in those who have acquired skill in blocking out information related to trauma.\n\n【49】In one study, we tested 3 groups of women: those with CSA-related PTSD; those exposed to CSA, but without psychiatric disorder; and nonabused controls.\n\n【50】In this directed-forgetting experiment, participants viewed a series of words on a computer screen that were trauma related (eg, incest), positive (eg, carefree), or neutral (eg, banister), and each word was followed by instructions directing the participant either to forget or remember the word. After this encoding phase, participants were asked to recall as many words as possible, regardless of the original forget/remember instruction. Participants with PTSD exhibited memory deficits for positive and neutral words, but, contrary to the dissociation hypothesis, recalled trauma-related words very well, including those that they were instructed to forget.\n\n【51】Subsequent experiments by our group\n\n【52】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【53】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【54】and others\n\n【55】have involved participants who claimed to harbor repressed memories of CSA or who reported having forgotten and then recalled their abuse, having never forgotten their abuse, or having no history of abuse. In none of these experiments have participants who reported CSA, as continuous, recovered, or repressed memories, exhibited heightened forgetting of trauma-related words.\n\n【56】Our research uses controlled methods of investigation and involves participants who report memories of abuse. However, it centers on trauma-related words, which are of course pale proxies of autobiographical memories of abuse. But if someone can block out autobiographical memories of abuse, then forgetting mere trauma-related words should be relatively easy. The rationale for this conjecture is as follows. Intense negative arousal tends to strengthen memory for the core aspects of the emotional experience, rendering it difficult to forget.\n\n【57】A person who managed to block out autobiographical memories of abuse should be easily able to block out a less emotionally provocative experience, such as encountering an abuse-related word in an experiment. My colleagues and I have yet to uncover any evidence of the heightened forgetting of negative emotional material in CSA survivors, and those with PTSD seem to exhibit a breakdown in the ability to forget such material.\n\n【58】Even if the aforementioned reasoning is correct, remembering and forgetting trauma-related words in the laboratory is somewhat artificial and may differ from remembering and forgetting traumatic events. Although our research group has conceptualized a heightened forgetting ability as a skill that can be applied in the laboratory, this assumption may be incorrect. Perhaps persons lose their capacity to forget abuse-related material once their autobiographical memories of abuse have returned.\n\n【59】A Third Perspective on Recovered Memories\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【60】In the “memory wars”\n\n【61】over the reality of repressed and recovered memories of trauma, especially CSA, 2 polarized positions have developed: the repressed memory view and the false memory view. According to the first view, memory of CSA operates according to principles different from those governing ordinary events. As Spiegel expressed it in _Repressed Memories_ ,\n\n【62】the nature of traumatic dissociative amnesia is such that it is not subject to the same rules of ordinary forgetting; it is more, rather than less, common after repeated episodes; involves strong affect; and is resistant to retrieval through salient cues.\n\n【63】In other words, the rules that ordinarily govern remembering and forgetting are suspended for at least some kinds of psychological trauma. If one accepts that memory of CSA obeys different rules than memory of other events, one can claim that anyone who reports having recalled long-forgotten abuse must have repressed or dissociated the memory. Traumatic dissociative amnesia theorists postulate special mechanisms because they assume that CSA is nearly always a terrifying, traumatic experience that should otherwise be highly memorable.\n\n【64】The false memory view operates on the (correct, in my opinion) assumption that repetition and emotional arousal should strengthen memory. According to this view, if someone claims to have remembered forgotten traumatic events, especially within the context of “recovered memory therapy,” then the recollection is likely false. Indeed, if we assume that CSA usually counts as a terrifying trauma, then the well-established mechanisms of memory should make amnesia difficult, if not impossible.\n\n【65】More than a “middle ground” between these 2 positions, a third perspective\n\n【66】goes beyond blandly affirming that sometimes repressed and sometimes false memories occur. In our research program,\n\n【67】the typical recovered memory participant reports having been nonviolently molested (eg, fondled) by a trusted adult (eg, uncle) on 1 or more occasions, and having been confused and upset, but not terrified.\n\n【68】Aged only 7 or 8 years, the average survivor did not fully understand the unpleasant experience as sexual abuse. Understanding such episodes as sexual abuse likely amplifies its negative emotional impact and hence its memorability. In the absence of such understanding, the episode is less likely to be as memorable as it would otherwise be. Lacking a conceptual framework for the molestation, the CSA survivor managed not to think about the experience for many years, and this ordinary forgetting was fostered by the absence of reminders (eg, perpetrator moved away). Years later, the abuse survivor encounters reminders that trigger recollection of the long-forgotten experience from the perspective of an adult. Because the event was not understood when it occurred and was not experienced as traumatic, no special dissociative mechanism is needed to explain why the person did not think about it for so long. Once CSA survivors in our research program have recalled the event as adults, usually outside the context of therapy, they tend to experience intense distress, and nearly one third of them qualify for PTSD.\n\n【69】These data suggest that survivors of CSA may recall memories of sexual abuse without these memories previously having been repressed or dissociated. A recovered memory does not imply a previously repressed or a traumatic memory.\n\n【70】During a period of forgetfulness, some survivors of CSA may forget having previously recalled an aversive event.\n\n【71】Geraerts et al\n\n【72】reported that survivors of CSA are more likely to forget having remembered abuse if memories of that abuse (possibly false?) were recalled outside of rather than in psychotherapy.\n\n【73】Even if it is not perceived as terrifying, an act of molestation is no less morally reprehensible. Sexual abuse is a social evil regardless of whether it triggers terror or causes psychiatric illness.\n\n【74】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【75】This review of the evidence adduced in support of the concept of traumatic dissociative amnesia raises questions about whether such a phenomenon exists as a natural capacity of the brain. Most studies cited by traumatic dissociative amnesia theorists either concern other kinds of memory phenomena (eg, everyday forgetfulness emerging after a trauma) or findings that are more plausibly explained in other ways (eg, not thinking about something for a long time). Indeed, a comprehensive review of the medical and nonmedical literature by Pope et al\n\n【76】implied that the concept of traumatic dissociative amnesia (repressed and recovered memory of a trauma) may be a social construction that arose first in the literary culture of Romanticism. They were unable to locate any descriptions of a repressed and recovered traumatic memory before the 19th century. This absence of evidence for repressed memories of trauma contrasts sharply with descriptions of mania, melancholia, auditory hallucinations, and other disorders throughout history and across cultures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【16】删除19:,\n\n【17】).

If therapists believe that recalling repressed or dissociated memories is vital for healing, they may embark on a treatment regimen that could foster false memories of abuse.\n\n【47】Experimental Cognitive Research\n-------------------------------\n\n【48】If adult survivors of CSA are prone to repress, dissociate, or otherwise forget their abuse, then one might be able to detect this heightened forgetting skill in the laboratory. My colleagues and I have conducted experiments designed to test for the presence of cognitive mechanisms that ought to be operative in those who have acquired skill in blocking out information related to trauma.\n\n【49】In one study, we tested 3 groups of women: those with CSA-related PTSD; those exposed to CSA, but without psychiatric disorder; and nonabused controls.\n\n【50】In this directed-forgetting experiment, participants viewed a series of words on a computer screen that were trauma related (eg, incest), positive (eg, carefree), or neutral (eg, banister), and each word was followed by instructions directing the participant either to forget or remember the word. After this encoding phase, participants were asked to recall as many words as possible, regardless of the original forget/remember instruction. Participants with PTSD exhibited memory deficits for positive and neutral words, but, contrary to the dissociation hypothesis, recalled trauma-related words very well, including those that they were instructed to forget.\n\n【51】Subsequent experiments by our group\n\n【52】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【53】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【54】and others\n\n【55】have involved participants who claimed to harbor repressed memories of CSA or who reported having forgotten and then recalled their abuse, having never forgotten their abuse, or having no history of abuse. In none of these experiments have participants who reported CSA, as continuous, recovered, or repressed memories, exhibited heightened forgetting of trauma-related words.\n\n【56】Our research uses controlled methods of investigation and involves participants who report memories of abuse. However, it centers on trauma-related words, which are of course pale proxies of autobiographical memories of abuse. But if someone can block out autobiographical memories of abuse, then forgetting mere trauma-related words should be relatively easy. The rationale for this conjecture is as follows. Intense negative arousal tends to strengthen memory for the core aspects of the emotional experience, rendering it difficult to forget.\n\n【57】A person who managed to block out autobiographical memories of abuse should be easily able to block out a less emotionally provocative experience, such as encountering an abuse-related word in an experiment. My colleagues and I have yet to uncover any evidence of the heightened forgetting of negative emotional material in CSA survivors, and those with PTSD seem to exhibit a breakdown in the ability to forget such material.\n\n【58】Even if the aforementioned reasoning is correct, remembering and forgetting trauma-related words in the laboratory is somewhat artificial and may differ from remembering and forgetting traumatic events. Although our research group has conceptualized a heightened forgetting ability as a skill that can be applied in the laboratory, this assumption may be incorrect. Perhaps persons lose their capacity to forget abuse-related material once their autobiographical memories of abuse have returned.\n\n【59】A Third Perspective on Recovered Memories\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【60】In the “memory wars”\n\n【61】over the reality of repressed and recovered memories of trauma, especially CSA, 2 polarized positions have developed: the repressed memory view and the false memory view. According to the first view, memory of CSA operates according to principles different from those governing ordinary events. As Spiegel expressed it in _Repressed Memories_ ,\n\n【62】the nature of traumatic dissociative amnesia is such that it is not subject to the same rules of ordinary forgetting; it is more, rather than less, common after repeated episodes; involves strong affect; and is resistant to retrieval through salient cues.\n\n【63】In other words, the rules that ordinarily govern remembering and forgetting are suspended for at least some kinds of psychological trauma. If one accepts that memory of CSA obeys different rules than memory of other events, one can claim that anyone who reports having recalled long-forgotten abuse must have repressed or dissociated the memory. Traumatic dissociative amnesia theorists postulate special mechanisms because they assume that CSA is nearly always a terrifying, traumatic experience that should otherwise be highly memorable.\n\n【64】The false memory view operates on the (correct, in my opinion) assumption that repetition and emotional arousal should strengthen memory. According to this view, if someone claims to have remembered forgotten traumatic events, especially within the context of “recovered memory therapy,” then the recollection is likely false. Indeed, if we assume that CSA usually counts as a terrifying trauma, then the well-established mechanisms of memory should make amnesia difficult, if not impossible.\n\n【65】More than a “middle ground” between these 2 positions, a third perspective\n\n【66】goes beyond blandly affirming that sometimes repressed and sometimes false memories occur. In our research program,\n\n【67】the typical recovered memory participant reports having been nonviolently molested (eg, fondled) by a trusted adult (eg, uncle) on 1 or more occasions, and having been confused and upset, but not terrified.\n\n【68】Aged only 7 or 8 years, the average survivor did not fully understand the unpleasant experience as sexual abuse. Understanding such episodes as sexual abuse likely amplifies its negative emotional impact and hence its memorability. In the absence of such understanding, the episode is less likely to be as memorable as it would otherwise be. Lacking a conceptual framework for the molestation, the CSA survivor managed not to think about the experience for many years, and this ordinary forgetting was fostered by the absence of reminders (eg, perpetrator moved away). Years later, the abuse survivor encounters reminders that trigger recollection of the long-forgotten experience from the perspective of an adult. Because the event was not understood when it occurred and was not experienced as traumatic, no special dissociative mechanism is needed to explain why the person did not think about it for so long. Once CSA survivors in our research program have recalled the event as adults, usually outside the context of therapy, they tend to experience intense distress, and nearly one third of them qualify for PTSD.\n\n【69】These data suggest that survivors of CSA may recall memories of sexual abuse without these memories previously having been repressed or dissociated. A recovered memory does not imply a previously repressed or a traumatic memory.\n\n【70】During a period of forgetfulness, some survivors of CSA may forget having previously recalled an aversive event.\n\n【71】Geraerts et al\n\n【72】reported that survivors of CSA are more likely to forget having remembered abuse if memories of that abuse (possibly false?) were recalled outside of rather than in psychotherapy.\n\n【73】Even if it is not perceived as terrifying, an act of molestation is no less morally reprehensible. Sexual abuse is a social evil regardless of whether it triggers terror or causes psychiatric illness.\n\n【74】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【75】This review of the evidence adduced in support of the concept of traumatic dissociative amnesia raises questions about whether such a phenomenon exists as a natural capacity of the brain. Most studies cited by traumatic dissociative amnesia theorists either concern other kinds of memory phenomena (eg, everyday forgetfulness emerging after a trauma) or findings that are more plausibly explained in other ways (eg, not thinking about something for a long time). Indeed, a comprehensive review of the medical and nonmedical literature by Pope et al\n\n【76】implied that the concept of traumatic dissociative amnesia (repressed and recovered memory of a trauma) may be a social construction that arose first in the literary culture of Romanticism. They were unable to locate any descriptions of a repressed and recovered traumatic memory before the 19th century. This absence of evidence for repressed memories of trauma contrasts sharply with descriptions of mania, melancholia, auditory hallucinations, and other disorders throughout history and across cultures.", "index": 4303, "show": true, "start": 4303, "end": 4527, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余标点"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【17】).

Otolaryngologic, ophthalmologic, and systemic manifestations of disease were analyzed. Analysis included patient demographics, presenting manifestations, delayed manifestations, laboratory testing, physical examination features, therapeutic interventions, disease course, and hearing and vision outcomes.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Sixty patients were identified as having Cogan syndrome, with follow-up from 1940 to 2002. Most patients presented initially with vestibuloauditory symptoms, most commonly sudden hearing loss (50%). The most common inflammatory ophthalmologic condition noted was bilateral interstitial keratitis. Headache (40%), fever (27%), and arthralgia (35%) were the most frequently encountered systemic manifestations. Evidence of aortitis was found in 12% of patients.

The first view is that new medical practices should only be instituted when large, well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have a benefit on hard outcomes (mortality or morbidity), and current standards of care should be systematically subjected to such testing. The second view is that it is not only reasonable but also essential to institute and embrace practices when there is a reasonable belief that the practice is beneficial on the basis of the best available evidence and not necessarily RCTs. If at a future date a practice is found not to work, it is reasonable to discontinue it, but strict adherence to the first view would paralyze clinical care and limit progress.\n\n【1】The second view (reasonable belief) has dominated medicine for most of the 20th century and continues to exert a powerful influence well into this one. The first view (evidence first) has been promoted\n\n【2】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【3】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【4】and continues to make inroads but also faces strong opposition from those who hold the second view. In this article, I define the 2 views and explore the questions they raise: Do they have common ground? Can evidence guide us? And, most important, which view should you hold?\n\n【5】The 2 Views\n-----------\n\n【6】Dueling arguments on the appropriateness of using CYP2C19 genotype results for decisions regarding the use of clopidogrel indicate the contrast between the sides. Representing evidence first, Nissen\n\n【7】writes, no matter how promising, pharmacogenetic approaches to treatment must withstand the same scrutiny required of all therapeutic advances—careful evaluation through well designed randomized clinical trials. His remark is immediately met with criticism. Shuldiner et al,\n\n【8】representing reasonable belief, write, We contend that until the results of such studies are available, clinicians must evaluate the full body of evidence and use their best clinical judgment…\\[Nissen's position\\] may be denying patients access to potentially life-saving individualized alternative therapies. Nissen responds, “I could not more strongly disagree….”\n\n【9】Both parties would not dispute the facts. Although some analyses\n\n【10】Reduced-function CYP2C19 genotype and risk of adverse clinical outcomes among patients treated with clopidogrel predominantly for PCI: a meta-analysis.\n\n【11】have found that CYP2C19 genotype status predicts clinical outcomes for patients taking clopidogrel, others have not.\n\n【12】Thus, as a profession, we may legitimately be unsure of whether CYP2C19 loss of function alleles worsen outcomes among patients taking clopidogrel and whether these patients would be better served by a drug that does not require conversion to active metabolite (such as prasugrel). Nissen believes that uncertainty warrants skepticism and that routine testing should not begin until trials indicate it improves outcomes. Shuldiner et al believe that the same uncertainly should be met with tolerance and that we should test in certain cases.\n\n【13】This disagreement of one's medical worldview has become common in medical literature but is seldom directly discussed. Commenting on data that suggest routine use of pulmonary artery catheters does not improve outcomes in patients with shock, Hall\n\n【14】writes, the extrication from widespread use of a technology that has not been adequately assessed is difficult and painful, and should be made unnecessary by the prospective testing of all technology introduced into critical care in the future (view 1: evidence first). Meanwhile, commenting on 2 sham control trials of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic fractures, which found no benefit of the common practice, Weinstein\n\n【15】writes, “when faced with several choices for which the evidence is less than clear, patients and doctors must thoroughly review the options together” (view 2: reasonable belief).\n\n【16】A full-fledged embrace of reasonable belief was recently made in an article arguing that we should move ahead and treat certain patients with smoldering multiple myeloma, a precursor to myeloma, lacking end organ damage.\n\n【17】The authors argue that the evidence-first view “may delay progress by a decade or more” and, as such, is a “disservice to some high-risk patients.”\n\n【18】In recent years, support for evidence first has increased. In an editorial on the increasing rate of radiation exposure due to medical imaging, Lauer\n\n【19】writes, “we need to adopt a new paradigm…were we to insist that all, or nearly all, procedures be studied in well-designed trials, we could answer many critical clinical questions within a short time.” Dhruva and Redberg\n\n【20】concur. They argue that sex-specific data (indicating benefit in women) should be acquired and examined before insurers cover novel practices: “Data on therapeutic benefit should be gathered before Food and Drug Administration approval and Medicare coverage, as patterns of care become established quickly after approval.”\n\n【21】Discussing the emergence of computer-aided detection mammography, Kerlikowske\n\n【22】writes, “Health care providers should not adopt new technologies without first demanding scientific evidence beyond that required for FDA \\[Food and Drug Administration\\] approval…\\[that\\] the benefits outweigh the harms.” Regarding screening for coronary artery disease with electron-beam computed tomography, Chen and Krumholz\n\n【23】write, Evidence that EBCT \\[electron-beam computed tomography\\] is effective in reducing mortality or morbidity is arguably the most important barrier that this technology must clear before its routine use can be justified.\n\n【24】Problems With the Second View\n-----------------------------\n\n【25】Although reasonable belief is compelling and may strike many as the pragmatic position, there are deep problems with continuing to abide by it. One problem occurs in the inevitable situations in which our judgment regarding the best available evidence is later found to be in error. Previously, we have called such contradicted practices _medical reversals_ .\n\n【26】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【27】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【28】A review of 35 trials in a high-impact medical journal, which tested standard of care, found that 16 (46%) were reversals.\n\n【29】Another study of 363 current medical practices found that 146 (40.2%) were medical reversals.\n\n【30】A decade of reversal: an analysis of 146 contradicted medical practices.\n\n【31】Elsewhere, my colleagues and I considered the costs for both human health and the health care system of medical reversal and concluded that the calculus strongly favors doing everything possible to minimize reversal (ie, view 1).\n\n【32】The other major problem with reasonable belief is that what counts as reasonable, the best judgment of current knowledge, is inherently slippery, allowing the pervasive influence of conflicted parties (those with a financial interest in the results, such as industry or investigators with professional bias) to affect our practice. There is perhaps no better example of this than the dominance of the selective serotonin receptor inhibitors in the treatment of depression. Although the efficacy of selective serotonin receptor inhibitors is determined on the basis of hundreds if not thousands of RCTs,\n\n【33】nearly none were cleanly conducted, well-designed studies that assessed long-term end points in diverse and unfiltered groups and whose results might have reliably guided clinical decisions. Nevertheless, several of these drugs became billion dollar industries unto themselves.\n\n【34】In 2008, two meta-analyses suggested that for many patients the drugs had no benefit greater than placebo.\n\n【35】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【36】Poor study design, short follow-up, selective and distorted reporting, and building a supporting scientific myth have been implicated as factors that contributed to false enthusiasm.\n\n【37】The case of smoldering myeloma illustrates possible professional bias. Leaders in the translation science of myeloma are those who call for an embrace of reasonable belief, confident in their pathophysiologic understanding. It is not surprising that skeptics, not proponents, require RCTs to convince them that earlier treatment improves meaningful outcomes.\n\n【38】The last problem with reasonable belief is that it lacks consistency. What is reasonable on the basis of best available evidence to one physician might not be to another. Some may consider the use of inferior vena cava filters necessary, to be considered, or absolutely useless in patients with deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both (in patients receiving and not receiving anticoagulation). Currently, there are no well-designed (double-blinded, hard outcome) studies to provide guidance. For the inferior vena cava filter, a lack of evidence is likely the reason why the 4 major sets of guidelines deviate so greatly from one another.\n\n【39】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【40】In other cases, expert guidelines may provide consistency but may be skewed toward action because of financial conflicts of interest. Several sets of national guidelines have been faulted for this reason.\n\n【41】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【42】Lastly, if we relegate judgment to individual practitioners, practice may be biased by reimbursement (particularly among specialists whose salaries are tied to intervention). Under current payment structures, it may be truly impossible to practice view 2 impartially. Likely, this is the state of medicine.\n\n【43】The First View Will Not Prevent All Contradiction\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】It is worth noting that evidence first will not be able to altogether prevent erroneous practices from entering the mainstream. A key example is drotrecogin alfa (activated). In 2001 the Food and Drug Administration licensed drotrecogin alfa for the treatment of septic shock and severe sepsis on the basis of an RCT (PROWESS \\[Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis\\]\n\n【45】Efficacy and safety of recombinant human activated protein C for severe sepsis.\n\n【46】), which found an improvement in all-cause mortality. A decade later, the manufacturer voluntarily recalled the drug after another large RCT\n\n【47】Drotrecogin alfa (activated) in adults with septic shock.\n\n【48】failed to substantiate its benefit. The case of drotrecogin alfa suggests that some reversal may be unavoidable. Randomized controlled trials are not infallible, yet they remain the strongest truth claim in the medical sciences.\n\n【49】How to Evaluate the 2 Views\n---------------------------\n\n【50】As a thought experiment, we might consider what it would be like to formally compare the 2 views to each other. Each potentially has strengths and weaknesses. Evidence first has the advantage of limiting the spread of ultimately mistaken medicine, and reasonable belief has the benefit of allowing for the early adoption of ultimately beneficial practices. Unfortunately, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to compare the 2 worldviews by RCT. Although we might imagine randomizing hospitals or insurance companies and following hard outcomes, such a study would be fraught with crossover as optimistic patients transfer to reasonable belief providers. In addition, the mere existence of reasonable belief medical systems would diminish the pressure on developers to perform studies to meet the standards of evidence first. A smaller market share that comes easily may be more enticing than twice that hard earned.

The first view is that new medical practices should only be instituted when large, well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have a benefit on hard outcomes (mortality or morbidity), and current standards of care should be systematically subjected to such testing. The second view is that it is not only reasonable but also essential to institute and embrace practices when there is a reasonable belief that the practice is beneficial on the basis of the best available evidence and not necessarily RCTs. If at a future date a practice is found not to work, it is reasonable to discontinue it, but strict adherence to the first view would paralyze clinical care and limit progress.\n\n【1】The second view (reasonable belief) has dominated medicine for most of the 20th century and continues to exert a powerful influence well into this one. The first view (evidence first) has been promoted\n\n【2】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【3】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【4】and continues to make inroads but also faces strong opposition from those who hold the second view. In this article, I define the 2 views and explore the questions they raise: Do they have common ground? Can evidence guide us? And, most important, which view should you hold?\n\n【5】The 2 Views\n-----------\n\n【6】Dueling arguments on the appropriateness of using CYP2C19 genotype results for decisions regarding the use of clopidogrel indicate the contrast between the sides. Representing evidence first, Nissen\n\n【7】writes, no matter how promising, pharmacogenetic approaches to treatment must withstand the same scrutiny required of all therapeutic advances—careful evaluation through well designed randomized clinical trials. His remark is immediately met with criticism. Shuldiner et al,\n\n【8】representing reasonable belief, write, We contend that until the results of such studies are available, clinicians must evaluate the full body of evidence and use their best clinical judgment…\\[Nissen's position\\] may be denying patients access to potentially life-saving individualized alternative therapies. Nissen responds, “I could not more strongly disagree….”\n\n【9】Both parties would not dispute the facts. Although some analyses\n\n【10】Reduced-function CYP2C19 genotype and risk of adverse clinical outcomes among patients treated with clopidogrel predominantly for PCI: a meta-analysis.\n\n【11】have found that CYP2C19 genotype status predicts clinical outcomes for patients taking clopidogrel, others have not.\n\n【12】Thus, as a profession, we may legitimately be unsure of whether CYP2C19 loss of function alleles worsen outcomes among patients taking clopidogrel and whether these patients would be better served by a drug that does not require conversion to active metabolite (such as prasugrel). Nissen believes that uncertainty warrants skepticism and that routine testing should not begin until trials indicate it improves outcomes. Shuldiner et al believe that the same uncertainly should be met with tolerance and that we should test in certain cases.\n\n【13】This disagreement of one's medical worldview has become common in medical literature but is seldom directly discussed. Commenting on data that suggest routine use of pulmonary artery catheters does not improve outcomes in patients with shock, Hall\n\n【14】writes, the extrication from widespread use of a technology that has not been adequately assessed is difficult and painful, and should be made unnecessary by the prospective testing of all technology introduced into critical care in the future (view 1: evidence first). Meanwhile, commenting on 2 sham control trials of vertebroplasty for osteoporotic fractures, which found no benefit of the common practice, Weinstein\n\n【15】writes, “when faced with several choices for which the evidence is less than clear, patients and doctors must thoroughly review the options together” (view 2: reasonable belief).\n\n【16】A full-fledged embrace of reasonable belief was recently made in an article arguing that we should move ahead and treat certain patients with smoldering multiple myeloma, a precursor to myeloma, lacking end organ damage.\n\n【17】The authors argue that the evidence-first view “may delay progress by a decade or more” and, as such, is a “disservice to some high-risk patients.”\n\n【18】In recent years, support for evidence first has increased. In an editorial on the increasing rate of radiation exposure due to medical imaging, Lauer\n\n【19】writes, “we need to adopt a new paradigm…were we to insist that all, or nearly all, procedures be studied in well-designed trials, we could answer many critical clinical questions within a short time.” Dhruva and Redberg\n\n【20】concur. They argue that sex-specific data (indicating benefit in women) should be acquired and examined before insurers cover novel practices: “Data on therapeutic benefit should be gathered before Food and Drug Administration approval and Medicare coverage, as patterns of care become established quickly after approval.”\n\n【21】Discussing the emergence of computer-aided detection mammography, Kerlikowske\n\n【22】writes, “Health care providers should not adopt new technologies without first demanding scientific evidence beyond that required for FDA \\[Food and Drug Administration\\] approval…\\[that\\] the benefits outweigh the harms.” Regarding screening for coronary artery disease with electron-beam computed tomography, Chen and Krumholz\n\n【23】write, Evidence that EBCT \\[electron-beam computed tomography\\] is effective in reducing mortality or morbidity is arguably the most important barrier that this technology must clear before its routine use can be justified.\n\n【24】Problems With the Second View\n-----------------------------\n\n【25】Although reasonable belief is compelling and may strike many as the pragmatic position, there are deep problems with continuing to abide by it. One problem occurs in the inevitable situations in which our judgment regarding the best available evidence is later found to be in error. Previously, we have called such contradicted practices _medical reversals_ .\n\n【26】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【27】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【28】A review of 35 trials in a high-impact medical journal, which tested standard of care, found that 16 (46%) were reversals.\n\n【29】Another study of 363 current medical practices found that 146 (40.2%) were medical reversals.\n\n【30】A decade of reversal: an analysis of 146 contradicted medical practices.\n\n【31】Elsewhere, my colleagues and I considered the costs for both human health and the health care system of medical reversal and concluded that the calculus strongly favors doing everything possible to minimize reversal (ie, view 1).\n\n【32】The other major problem with reasonable belief is that what counts as reasonable, the best judgment of current knowledge, is inherently slippery, allowing the pervasive influence of conflicted parties (those with a financial interest in the results, such as industry or investigators with professional bias) to affect our practice. There is perhaps no better example of this than the dominance of the selective serotonin receptor inhibitors in the treatment of depression. Although the efficacy of selective serotonin receptor inhibitors is determined on the basis of hundreds if not thousands of RCTs,\n\n【33】nearly none were cleanly conducted, well-designed studies that assessed long-term end points in diverse and unfiltered groups and whose results might have reliably guided clinical decisions. Nevertheless, several of these drugs became billion dollar industries unto themselves.\n\n【34】In 2008, two meta-analyses suggested that for many patients the drugs had no benefit greater than placebo.\n\n【35】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【36】Poor study design, short follow-up, selective and distorted reporting, and building a supporting scientific myth have been implicated as factors that contributed to false enthusiasm.\n\n【37】The case of smoldering myeloma illustrates possible professional bias. Leaders in the translation science of myeloma are those who call for an embrace of reasonable belief, confident in their pathophysiologic understanding. It is not surprising that skeptics, not proponents, require RCTs to convince them that earlier treatment improves meaningful outcomes.\n\n【38】The last problem with reasonable belief is that it lacks consistency. What is reasonable on the basis of best available evidence to one physician might not be to another. Some may consider the use of inferior vena cava filters necessary, to be considered, or absolutely useless in patients with deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or both (in patients receiving and not receiving anticoagulation). Currently, there are no well-designed (double-blinded, hard outcome) studies to provide guidance. For the inferior vena cava filter, a lack of evidence is likely the reason why the 4 major sets of guidelines deviate so greatly from one another.\n\n【39】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【40】In other cases, expert guidelines may provide consistency but may be skewed toward action because of financial conflicts of interest. Several sets of national guidelines have been faulted for this reason.\n\n【41】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【42】Lastly, if we relegate judgment to individual practitioners, practice may be biased by reimbursement (particularly among specialists whose salaries are tied to intervention). Under current payment structures, it may be truly impossible to practice view 2 impartially. Likely, this is the state of medicine.\n\n【43】The First View Will Not Prevent All Contradiction\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】It is worth noting that evidence first will not be able to altogether prevent erroneous practices from entering the mainstream. A key example is drotrecogin alfa (activated). In 2001 the Food and Drug Administration licensed drotrecogin alfa for the treatment of septic shock and severe sepsis on the basis of an RCT (PROWESS \\[Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis\\]\n\n【45】Efficacy and safety of recombinant human activated protein C for severe sepsis.\n\n【46】), which found an improvement in all-cause mortality. A decade later, the manufacturer voluntarily recalled the drug after another large RCT\n\n【47】Drotrecogin alfa (activated) in adults with septic shock.\n\n【48】failed to substantiate its benefit. The case of drotrecogin alfa suggests that some reversal may be unavoidable. Randomized controlled trials are not infallible, yet they remain the strongest truth claim in the medical sciences.\n\n【49】How to Evaluate the 2 Views\n---------------------------\n\n【50】As a thought experiment, we might consider what it would be like to formally compare the 2 views to each other. Each potentially has strengths and weaknesses. Evidence first has the advantage of limiting the spread of ultimately mistaken medicine, and reasonable belief has the benefit of allowing for the early adoption of ultimately beneficial practices. Unfortunately, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to compare the 2 worldviews by RCT. Although we might imagine randomizing hospitals or insurance companies and following hard outcomes, such a study would be fraught with crossover as optimistic patients transfer to reasonable belief providers. In addition, the mere existence of reasonable belief medical systems would diminish the pressure on developers to perform studies to meet the standards of evidence first. A smaller market share that comes easily may be more enticing than twice that hard earned. For these reasons it is unlikely that we can ever truly know which view of medicine is better in the rigorous way that evidence first demands.\n\n【51】Will a High Bar Dissuade Innovation?\n------------------------------------\n\n【52】A perennial argument against higher up-front standards for approval is that it would dissuade innovation,\n\n【53】but there is a distinction worth making here. Innovation is only valuable if new products improve meaningful outcomes. Novel therapies that do not do so but merely favorably affect surrogates are deceptive and wasteful. If manufacturers are confident that their products are truly beneficial, a high bar does not change anything.\n\n【54】Perhaps the crux of the matter here is the related problem of market exclusivity, in which patent holders have sole production rights and may recoup initial outlays. Assessing meaningful end points requires longer study periods, which will cost time on industry patents. Additional market exclusivity, for products with meaningful gains, may be one way to remedy this.\n\n【55】Common Ground\n-------------\n\n【56】Whether new practices should be required to show up-front benefit in well-designed, properly controlled RCTs that examine hard end points remains the central disagreement between the 2 views; however, when it comes to existing practices, the 2 views do not disagree. Both sides agree that we need to systematically appraise current clinical practice that is hitherto untested. Proponents of reasonable belief do not believe that we should remain ignorant, and proponents of evidence first do not believe that we should immediately abandon all unproven medicine.

It was ordered by physicians from a variety of specialty and subspecialty backgrounds, as intended by the protocol's developers. The real-world experience with this protocol yielded some startling results, not all of which were flattering to the caregivers. Before we analyze the results, it is important to understand the impetus for developing such a treatment protocol. Later, we examine the broader implications of having physicians from diverse backgrounds administer a protocol based on a diagnosis ideally evaluated and treated by specialists in substance abuse.\n\n【2】Ethyl alcohol is the most commonly abused psychotropic compound in the United States. An estimated 17.6 million Americans (8.5%) have some form of alcohol use disorder,\n\n【3】Prevalence and co-occurrence of substance use disorders and independent mood and anxiety disorders.\n\n【4】and 15% of patient hospitalizations result directly from alcohol-related morbidity.\n\n【5】The latter relates to the fact that people who abuse alcohol have a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal diseases (including hemorrhage and hepatic failure), nutritional deficiencies, diabetes mellitus, coexisting mental illnesses,\n\n【6】and traumatic injuries\n\n【7】compared with nonabusers. Given the diverse organ systems involved and the mix of medical and surgical conditions, physicians from virtually every medical specialty likely encounter a patient who has abused alcohol and is at risk of developing alcohol withdrawal symptoms while hospitalized (with no access to alcohol during hospitalization). Additionally, many patients who abuse alcohol underestimate or deny the extent of their alcohol abuse when communicating with their physicians. Furthermore, the American medical environment simply does not have enough true experts in alcohol withdrawal to immediately care for the patient who develops alcohol-related problems while hospitalized. Thus, tools are needed to help physicians and surgeons who otherwise are not experts in the diagnosis and treatment of AWS to better care for the patients they occasionally encounter who are experiencing AWS in the hospital.\n\n【8】With this in mind, in 1998, a multidisciplinary group at Mayo Clinic (chaired by R.M.M. with K.H.B. as a group member) developed a practice guideline entitled “Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome in Adults Practice Guideline” to help physicians and surgeons from diverse backgrounds more accurately diagnose patients at high risk for developing complications associated with AWS and care for those patients by using a standardized order set. After demonstration of this guideline's utility and practicality in a small pilot study, it was fully implemented in January 2000. The approach to the protocol was straightforward: In a patient with a history of recent heavy alcohol use and with a clear enough sensorium to be able to give a cogent reply to the portions of the CIWA-Ar tool that required answers, a physician institutes the protocol. Thereafter, and with close nurse monitoring, benzodiazepines are titrated in a symptomdriven fashion to the desired level of sedation or symptom abatement.\n\n【9】The “Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome in Adults Practice Guideline” was used at Mayo Clinic to treat 495 patients during 2003, with one quarter (124) of these episodes reviewed by Hecksel et al. These patients had a wide variety of admission diagnoses and were cared for by physicians and surgeons from a variety of disciplines. In some ways, their summarized experience in the Proceedings identifies an expected truism: The ability of a protocol to treat a medical condition is no better than the quality of the treatment protocol, the strength of the diagnosis, and the application of the protocol to the treatment of appropriate patients. What is surprising is that this approach failed so frequently because the physicians and surgeons often applied the protocol inappropriately.\n\n【10】We doubt that the protocol itself is at fault because the CIWA-Ar has well-documented utility for measuring withdrawal symptoms, and symptom-triggered therapy is well supported by the literature.\n\n【11】Individualized treatment for alcohol withdrawal: a randomized double-blind controlled trial.\n\n【12】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【13】It is disturbing that for 64 patients (52% of the 124 patient cohort), the protocol was applied in patient scenarios specifically proscribed by the protocol: Nine patients (14%) could not communicate sufficiently well to be included in the protocol, 35 (55%) could communicate but had not been drinking recently, and 20 (31%) met neither criterion.\n\n【14】Although publishing the report by Hecksel et al might be viewed as “airing dirty laundry,” we believe their article is a valuable addition to the literature. The mere institution of guidelines without further review about their proper application and utility does not ensure the expected improvement on practice. One cannot recognize problems or improve such protocols until they are systematically critiqued in actual clinical use beyond a simple pilot project. Indeed, reporting of failures related to application of this protocol is similar to the recent American Heart Association reformulation of advance cardiac life support protocols and provider education.\n\n【15】In the latter example, the American Heart Association determined that established protocols were not being appropriately applied to patient care, resulting in suboptimal outcomes. Only by identifying these limitations were they able to move forward. In essence, only by exposing some “dirty laundry to sunlight” were they able to effect change.\n\n【16】The care of hospitalized patients who experience AWS is best delivered by specialists in chemical dependency, acting in concert with the primary medical or surgical service. However, such care is often unavailable because of the shortage of appropriate specialists and lack of mechanisms to reimburse their input. Hecksel et al essentially evaluated the results of a highly specialized protocol in the hands of physicians who lack training in chemical dependency, and the results were disappointing. In this era of evidence-based medicine and a desire to standardize the care of patients with similar disease states, the research by Hecksel et al provides a valuable lesson: Protocol-driven or evidence-based treatment plans, when in the hands of physicians from diverse specialties, can fail because of improper diagnoses and applications. This scenario is different from the many successes that have resulted from placing highly developed, evidence-based protocols for specific disease states in the hands of highly trained subspecialists. One needs to look no farther than contemporary treatment of neoplastic diseases to see that this is the case. Whether successes with these highly specialized approaches to patient diseases, initiated by specialists, can occur with generalists or physicians from diverse specialties remains to be seen.

One promising management approach implemented by some leading health care institutions is Lean, a quality improvement philosophy and set of principles originated by the Toyota Motor Company. Health care cases reveal that Lean is as applicable in complex knowledge work as it is in assembly-line manufacturing. When well executed, Lean transforms how an organization works and creates an insatiable quest for improvement. In this article, we define Lean and present 6 principles that constitute the essential dynamic of Lean management: attitude of continuous improvement, value creation, unity of purpose, respect for front-line workers, visual tracking, and flexible regimentation. Health care case studies illustrate each principle. The goal of this article is to provide a template for health care leaders to use in considering the implementation of the Lean management system or in assessing the current state of implementation in their organizations.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】ED ( emergency department ), IV ( intravenous ), PDSA ( Plan-Do-Study-Act )\n\n【4】Pediatric surgeons at Seattle Children's vie to perform surgery at their new Bellevue Clinic and Surgery Center because of the efficient flow for patients, families, and the care team. Nonoperative time, defined as the time when dressings are placed on patient A to incision time for patient B, is 50% less than for similar operations performed at the main campus surgery center. Operations start when scheduled 99% of the time. More than 90% of patients and families give the Bellevue Surgery Center a 9 or 10 rating for overall care. ThedaCare, a Wisconsin-based integrated health system, reduced inpatient total cost of care by 25% while improving patient satisfaction to nearly 100% of patients rating their care 5 of 5. For 5 years running, no medication reconciliation errors occurred for patients in hospital units served by care teams that include a pharmacist.\n\n【5】The staff of the otolaryngology department of the Christie Clinic in Champaign, Illinois, begins each day with a huddle to identify problems and discuss potential solutions. The daily rhythm of the huddles, which include physicians, has improved internal communications and teamwork. In less than 1 year after starting the huddles, waiting time for appointments decreased by 28%, departmental capacity improved by 10% with no increase in head count, and patient satisfaction increased from 4.3 to 4.7 on a 5-point scale. Leadership of the huddles rotates weekly among the department's staff.\n\n【6】What links these 3 institutions is their journeys of implementing a quality improvement philosophy and set of principles originated by the Toyota Motor Company commonly referred to as Lean. The 3 health systems named and numerous others have clearly demonstrated that the Lean approach is just as applicable and useful in complex knowledge work as in assembly-line manufacturing. Early health system experiences with Lean also reveal the arduous nature of the journey.\n\n【7】Lean is not a program; it is not a set of quality improvement tools; it is not a quick fix; it is not a responsibility that can be delegated. Rather, Lean is a cultural transformation that changes how an organization works; no one stays on the sidelines in the quest to discover how to improve the daily work. It requires new habits, new skills, and often a new attitude throughout the organization from senior management to front-line service providers. Lean is a journey, not a destination. Unlike specific programs, Lean has no finish line. Creating a culture of Lean is to create an insatiable appetite for improvement; there is no turning back. As Lean consultant Joan Wellman states, “With Lean, you will keep changing your definition of what ‘good’ is.”\n\n【8】The emergence of Lean success stories in health care, a rapidly changing reimbursement environment that necessitates improved quality and efficiency, and the trend to public reporting of health care performance data\n\n【9】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【10】are converging to encourage health care leaders to consider Lean for their institutions. No health care organizations or practicing clinicians are immune from the simultaneous pressures to improve quality and lower costs. As former Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator and Institute for Healthcare Improvement founder Donald Berwick, MD, states, “The only way we can rescue American healthcare is to improve it.… We know what to do—better care, better health, lower cost.”\n\n【11】The growing health care interest in Lean creates fertile ground for rushing something that cannot be rushed, misunderstanding something that is not easily understood, and underinvesting in something that requires ongoing, multifaceted investment. Attempts to even define Lean have been elusive.\n\n【12】Health care personnel have encountered various versions of Lean. We've been told it is a 5-day workshop on the one hand and a whole system cultural change on the other hand. In this article, we apply our collective experiences in leading a Lean transformation at ThedaCare and in visiting more than 100 health care systems applying Lean (J.S.T.) and in career-long service quality research inside and outside health care (L.L.B.) to define Lean and present its essential principles. The principles are illustrated by case studies from health care based on information provided by the institutions featured, personal visits, and follow-up communications. Our goal is to provide a template for health care leaders to use in considering the opportunity Lean offers their institutions or in assessing the state of its implementation in their organizations.\n\n【13】Definition and Principles of Lean\n---------------------------------\n\n【14】Influenced by the work of Womack and Jones,\n\n【15】we define Lean in health care as “an organization's cultural commitment to applying the scientific method to designing, performing, and continuously improving the work delivered by teams of people, leading to measurably better value for patients and other stakeholders.” Lean is an operating system composed of 6 principles that constitute the essential dynamic of Lean management. To miss on any one of these principles is to miss on Lean's full potential to benefit the organization's stakeholders.\n\n【16】### Principle 1: Lean Is an Attitude of Continuous Improvement\n\n【17】Continuous improvement has its basis in a principle introduced by Shewhart\n\n【18】and refined by quality improvement pioneer Edwards Deming. The Deming Cycle is the foundation of Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA), a central tenet of Lean.\n\n【19】The PDSA approach is a scientific method applied to daily work: defining an explicit and measurable hypothesis about how a process can be improved, objectively testing the hypothesis, and, if improvement occurs, making the improved process “standard work” until such time as further improvement can be demonstrated.\n\n【20】Health care personnel are familiar with the scientific method in the form of controlled double-blind studies to test new treatments. Lean uses the same basic approach of measuring whether new process B is superior to existing process A.\n\n【21】For Lean to take hold in an organization and transform its culture to one of continuous improvement, senior management must relinquish the role of master problem solver to those who are closer to the problems to be solved—to benefit from their knowledge of the focal process, to give them hands-on experience in using Lean methods and to see first-hand the performance improvement and teamwork this can create, and to promote an attitude that what exists can likely be improved.\n\n【22】Clinical and nonclinical staff members who are given the encouragement, training, and time to make meaningful improvements in how the work is done are unlikely to want to retreat to an earlier period when formalized effort to improve existing processes was outside their domain of responsibility. As staff members gain confidence in their problem-solving skills and as they witness positive changes, momentum for even more improvement work is likely to build. This is Lean at its best; employees keep raising the bar, the organization becomes increasingly innovative, more staff want to be directly involved, and an attitude of continuous improvement becomes the driving force behind all work.\n\n【23】At St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton, California, a team recognized a significant issue with scheduling radiology appointments. The mean wait time on the telephone was 20 minutes, with a 17% to 20% dropped call rate. A process based on PDSA known as a rapid improvement event led to changes that include a staff huddle every morning to monitor and discuss the metrics of wait time, call volume, and dropped call rate, among other topics. The staff problem-solves issues from the previous day and anticipates issues for the upcoming day. At any time during the day, any team member can call for a huddle if performance issues arise. Such a huddle enables the staff to quickly identify and resolve problems. Total call volume has increased while wait time has decreased to under 1 minute and the dropped call rate to less than 3% with no increase in staffing.\n\n【24】### Principle 2: Lean Is Value-Creating\n\n【25】Health care is for patients; health care resources, directly or indirectly, should be used to benefit patients. The underlying goal of Lean in health care is to improve value for patients. Doing so should also benefit other health care stakeholders. Fewer medication errors, fewer nosocomial infections, less nursing time away from the bedside, faster operating room turnover time, improved care team communication about patients, and faster response time for emergent cases not only benefit patients but also physicians, nurses, health care organizations, payers, and the community.\n\n【26】Value in health care has been conceptualized as health outcomes per dollar spent\n\n【27】and outcomes per dollar spent _over time_ .\n\n【28】Patients, however, typically view value more broadly as benefits received for burdens endured.\n\n【29】Burdens include both monetary costs and nonmonetary costs. The benefits vs burdens conceptualization of value includes medical outcomes and financial costs but extends beyond these constructs to also include patients' perceptions of the overall health care experience. A clinician's sensitivity in answering patients' questions, an operation that starts on time, and a quiet, calming medical facility may be ancillary to the medical outcome, but they can still be important to patients' assessment of value. Conversely, a clinician's insensitivity, a delayed operation, and a stress-increasing medical facility can be meaningful nonmonetary burdens to patients in their assessment of value.\n\n【30】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【31】Patients' preferences for technical versus interpersonal quality when selecting a primary care physician.\n\n【32】Measuring improvement in processes due to Lean interventions ideally should encompass a benefits vs burdens effect on all affected stakeholders. Who is affected by the changed processes and in what ways? Do benefits increase? Do burdens decrease? These are the questions that robust Lean measurement should answer.\n\n【33】Value stream maps are a principal Lean tool used to distinguish between discrete steps in a process that do or do not contribute value . A team close to the work creates a visual map of each step in an existing process to better understand it (ie, the current state). Clearly understanding the current state is essential to improving it, and creating a detailed depiction of the process facilitates understanding. A value stream map differs from other mapping by combining information flow and material and people flow; this enables the team to more clearly see a complex system's current state and offers a roadmap for improvement. By studying a value stream map, the team can ask questions such as, “Why do we do this step?” “Would a patient be willing to pay for this part of the process if he/she had a choice?” “Is there a more efficient or effective alternative?” “Which steps in the process are most vulnerable to errors?”\n\n【34】Figure 1 Example of a value stream map.\n\n【35】Value stream mapping requires attention to detail; each discrete step in a process should be captured on the map. Lean is primarily about “majoring in minors,” that is, performing many small tasks better and creating value through the cumulative effect of small improvements. ThedaCare has a conference room that contains a large, finely detailed map of the patient's experience during a hospital stay. The admission process involves 124 steps, the discharge process 140 steps. This map has been through 7 stages of refinement at this writing. Various interfunctional teams work with different parts of the map in search of measurable improvement. One team, for example, has been working on reducing hospital readmission rates by improving the discharge process. The hospital value stream map room is where dozens of ThedaCare personnel working on various improvement teams seek to deeply understand the hospital care system's current state with the goal of improving the value it delivers—increasing the benefits and reducing the burdens for all stakeholders.\n\n【36】In perioperative services at 8 member hospitals of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, management recognized the need for a different infrastructure to support improvement. To engage interdisciplinary teams of front-line staff in the application of Lean tools, an external sensei (teacher) trained internal Lean facilitators at each site to design and lead improvement events. These teams sought to reduce handoffs and steps in presurgical testing, to increase on-time first case starts, to reduce turnaround time between cases, and to reduce the waste in searching for materials and the potential for errors caused by poorly managed inventory. Before the improvement events, the facilitator and area managers collected data to study process steps, cycle and flow times, and handoffs, and they crafted problem statements. During 4.5-day rapid improvement events, teams reviewed the problem; mapped the current and target state; described the ideal state (perfection) and analyzed the gap between the current and target state; developed, tested, and implemented successful solutions; and crafted the metrics necessary to confirm achievement of the target state. Results as of spring 2012 generated from improvement events occurring between 2009 and 2011 at these 8 hospitals include the following:\n\n【37】*   •\n\n【38】    Percentage of on-time starts increased from a baseline of 50% of total to a mean of 70%.\n\n【39】*   •\n\n【40】    Number of operating room cases per month increased from a baseline of 329 to a mean of 351.\n\n【41】*   •\n\n【42】    Operating room turnaround time decreased from a mean of 60 minutes to less than 40 minutes.\n\n【43】*   •\n\n【44】    Percentage of cases rescheduled due to late starts decreased from a mean of 21% to a mean of 4.4% of total cases.\n\n【45】*   •\n\n【46】    Same-day surgery cancellations decreased from 7% to less than 3% of total cases.\n\n【47】### Principle 3: Lean Is Unity of Purpose\n\n【48】Because health care organizations are complex systems, it is difficult for the staff to know what tasks are most important. Properly executed, Lean clarifies priorities and guides staff in improvement work accordingly. Lean work is focused work; priorities govern investment of improvement resources.\n\n【49】A key senior management role in Lean is to prioritize and clearly communicate a small number of strategic goal categories that are relevant throughout the organization and that have the most promise to strengthen the organization and create stakeholder value. Ideally, all Lean improvement projects fit within this strategic framework. Specific improvement projects (the “how”) move the organization forward in its prioritized goal categories (the “what”). Management uses a process called “catchball.” From chief executive officer to front-line supervisor, a series of conversations is constantly occurring. These conversations are documented on a single sheet of paper and changed each time different team members' ideas are gathered. On the single sheet (called an A3 simply to denote paper size), background and current conditions are documented for the strategy being studied. A strategy statement is developed and goals are established. The opportunities in the marketplace the strategy is attempting to address are identified and countermeasures are suggested. Finally, a plan is established. Through the catchball process, it is not unusual to have 15 drafts of the A3, indicating that many people have been involved in defining the new strategy.\n\n【50】This communication back and forth in the organization builds consensus, understanding, and engagement around the priorities.\n\n【51】Lean organizations often use the symbolic term _true north_ and visual expression to communicate and reinforce strategic priorities. ThedaCare's true north framework  puts the patient in the middle of a triangle and the strategic goal categories at the tips of the triangle. Two metrics are used to measure progress for each goal category and one for the patient, which is a customer loyalty score. This specific framework appears on improvement work boards in virtually every department and unit throughout ThedaCare's system of hospitals, clinics, and administrative offices. The several teams that conduct 4-day rapid improvement events every week at ThedaCare show how their work supports the true north framework on day 5, when they present their findings at an employee gathering called “Report Out.”\n\n【52】Figure 2 ThedaCare true north framework. DART indicates days away, restricted, and transferred and is an Occupational Safety and Health Administration formula to track employee injuries and illnesses.\n\n【53】St. Jude Medical Center has defined its true north as “Perfect Care, Healthiest Communities, and Sacred Encounters.” Perfect Care is translated into specific initiatives and metrics for inpatient, outpatient, and support areas. The Perfect Care focus on the critical care floor is the elimination of ventilator-acquired pneumonia. Before conducting a rapid improvement event, critical care staff believed they were doing everything possible to prevent ventilator-acquired pneumonia. The event showed otherwise, and staff implemented a visual management board outside each room of a patient receiving ventilatory assistance. On this board, red and green magnets are flipped every 2 hours as preventable measures are executed. This technique enables staff to quickly determine whether any preventable measure was missed. The care team meets regularly to review clinical evidence and discuss any misses in the preventable measures. The critical care unit has had zero preventable cases of ventilator-acquired pneumonia for more than 3 years at this writing, the result of unity of purpose around a true north metric.\n\n【54】### Principle 4: Lean Is Respect for the People Who Do the Work\n\n【55】A Lean leadership and management system differs from a hierarchical system in which higher-level managers and supervisors tell lower-level personnel what to do and how to do it.\n\n【56】This is perhaps the biggest challenge Lean implementation poses in many organizations: the people in charge may have to change the most for a Lean culture to develop.\n\n【57】Lean, in a sense, turns leadership upside down, with front-line workers doing much of the innovating and managers trusting them to do it and supporting them. Respect for the potential of front-line workers to have the brainpower and commitment to improve the work must pervade the organization. Respect flows downward, not just upward.\n\n【58】In Lean organizations, higher-level managers support the “improvers” by regularly visiting the worksites (or “Gemba” in Lean parlance) to learn firsthand about problems and barriers to improvement, by becoming teachers and role models of quality improvement, and by investing in the education, skills training, and tools necessary for front-line staff to be effective in improvement work. Management must make special efforts to create a safe environment for innovation, such as attacking processes rather than people so that staff members do not fear reporting problems.\n\n【59】Lean health care organizations often commit to retaining and, if necessary, retraining employees whose positions are eliminated by productivity gains or structural innovations. Such a policy alleviates staff concerns about working themselves out of a job.\n\n【60】Leading a Lean transformation from the top of the organization demands perseverance (because setbacks are inevitable as are pockets of resistance) and humility (because Lean exposes many problems, some of which are caused by the senior leaders themselves). Lean has the potential to turn an organization into a community of innovators. However, this can happen only in a culture of respect.\n\n【61】Martin Health System, based in Stuart, Florida, had an incident in which an emergency department (ED) nurse at its satellite hospital could not quickly locate an intravenous (IV) pump for a patient in the ED. Critical time was wasted before a pump could be located. This incident led to a comprehensive evaluation of nursing care processes. One finding was that nurses were each spending a mean of 38 minutes per shift looking for needed equipment. If the equipment was not available in the unit, additional time was then spent waiting for it to be provided. The effect on patients was less bedside nursing time and delayed treatments.\n\n【62】Nursing staff thought that there were never enough pumps and the solution was to order more. Lean concepts were applied to determine whether a shortage existed and, if so, how many more pumps were needed. The hospital had an inventory of 508 IV pumps to serve 344 beds. On the basis of a national IV pump-to-bed ratio of 1.2 pumps per bed, there was actually a surplus of 96 pumps. The issue was not a shortage but the lack of a procedure for nurses to access pumps quickly and easily. The lack of a procedure led to nurses hoarding unused pumps, which exacerbated the problem.\n\n【63】To improve, Martin installed “equipment supermarkets” in nursing units. The supermarkets contained all necessary equipment for specific units, for example, IV pumps, patient-controlled analgesia pumps, feeding pumps, sequential compression devices, and bed alerts. Standard work was developed to facilitate the availability of needed equipment. The equipment supermarket shelving was color coded and numbered with the quantity of items for each color: green indicates that supply is adequate; yellow, supply needs replenishing; and red, the need to call for immediate restocking of the item.\n\n【64】This process improvement has reduced mean nursing time spent gathering equipment to less than 1 minute, contributing to hard-dollar savings and productivity gains. For example, when use of a medication is discontinued, the IV pump is cleaned and returned to the equipment supermarket. By improving the use or “turns” of IV pumps, the hospital was able to replace the existing pump inventory with 100 fewer units, which yielded a direct savings of $300,000. Total nursing time spent gathering supplies was reduced by 34 hours per day.\n\n【65】Multiple departments collaborated on developing, testing, and refining the nursing equipment flow process, including nursing, material management, housekeeping, and decontamination. These staff members became a community of innovators to find a better way to ensure that essential hospital equipment was available where and when it was needed while minimizing nonuse of the equipment. One additional outcome at Martin: nurses have stopped hoarding IV pumps.\n\n【66】### Principle 5: Lean Is Visual\n\n【67】Visual tracking centers exist in numerous locations within a Lean hospital or clinic. These tracking centers are information displays mounted on the walls in staff-only areas. Their purpose is multifold: to present daily and trend performance data on key metrics (eg, patient satisfaction, cost, and quality metrics); to provide a dedicated place for any staff member to communicate an issue that needs attention or to post an improvement idea; to organize all relevant improvement information in one place (including projects not yet started, work in progress, and projects completed); to provide a gathering spot for both scheduled and impromptu staff meetings; and to symbolize a culture of transparency. A common sight in a Lean health care facility is staff meeting in front of a tracking center with the meeting leader continually referring to the posted information. This practice is referred to as “working the wall.”\n\n【68】Visual tracking center information is ever-changing, and thus it is common practice to use erasable marking pens, pencils, or sticky notes to present it. Whereas conventional bulletin boards at worksites often become stale because information either is not relevant or rarely changes, the converse is more likely with Lean tracking centers; the information is dynamic and directly relates to what staff are thinking about in terms of how best to provide what patients need and want.\n\n【69】When Seattle Children's built its new Bellevue Clinic and Surgery Center, it used Integrated Facility Design, a process based on Toyota's Production Planning Process approach. The Integrated Facility Design process brings a diverse set of stakeholders together for planning before a shovel ever enters the ground. The early involvement of stakeholders typically results in fewer changed work orders and more efficient construction. During planning, Seattle Children's brought together nurses, physicians, support staff, patients, architects, designers, and others to help determine the needs, goals, and metrics for the facility and to think through the most efficient flow and use of space. Value stream maps depicting the workflow were developed and agreed on by all vested parties, including patients and families. Families played an important role in fostering understanding of their needs and wants. For example, parents stressed their desire to stay with their child in the preoperative area and the space was designed to accommodate the presence of parents.\n\n【70】The value stream maps helped prioritize design requirements that contributed to the facility being built for $30 million less than initial estimates. The mapping allowed the team to see the waste in their existing care process, much of which they removed in designing a new ideal-state care process. The new ideal state was used to design the building space required, which cost less, rather than the space proposed in the original architectural design. The maps are still displayed in the back hall of the building and are regularly reviewed and updated. Metrics for both the clinic and surgery center are displayed in visual tracking centers throughout the facility.\n\n【71】### Principle 6: Lean Is Flexible Regimentation\n\n【72】Processes are perfectly designed to produce the results that occur.\n\n【73】But what if the results are not optimum? What if the results of specific processes indicate needless waiting, lost productivity, unexplained error rates, staff dissatisfaction, or patient harm? The key to improvement is determining the root cause (or causes) of performance shortfalls and ridding the process of the cause(s) through redesign. This is the essence of Lean: take nonstandard work processes and transform them into standard processes that improve performance and then continue to improve the standard work design through PDSA.\n\n【74】Standard work is best described as _flexible regimentation_ , a phrase coined by Robert Wilson, MD, a ThedaCare cardiologist. _Regimentation_ refers to developing a common or standard process for performing a specific service based on the best available evidence; _flexible_ refers to ongoing efforts to improve the standard process. A paradox of standard work is that the standards established release creativity.\n\n【75】With standard clinical approaches, patients who deviate from the standard are more easily appreciated, freeing up the clinicians to expend their mental energy on issues and patients. An example at Seattle Children's is the asthma care unit, in which standardization of albuterol therapy has allowed physicians to better identify patients who are not following the typical course. The fact that the standard approach to treatment does not work calls into question the diagnosis of asthma and forces the physician to search for other causes. The specific design of a standard process offers the opportunity for focused study and testing. Knowledge work is easier to study once it has been defined as a set of expected activities.\n\n【76】Process outcomes are sometimes so variable that they first must be stabilized before they can be standardized. Stabilizing a process involves finding a short-term method to contain unacceptable results until a standardized solution can be developed. For example, a patient falling off the fracture table in an operating room would be considered a “never event.” Should it happen, a hospital might decide to place a nurse on both sides of the table. Stabilizing this process with 2 nurses ensures the safety of the next patient in the same situation, but it may not be the final solution to fixing the problem. The root cause of the fall must be identified before new standard work can be designed to permanently eliminate the defect.\n\n【77】Inova, an integrated health system in Virginia, has 9 EDs that treat approximately 400,000 patients annually. At the beginning of 2008, Inova's EDs were achieving average performance on quality, patient satisfaction, cost, and throughput measures. During 2008, Inova initiated process improvement in its EDs in conjunction with the implementation of a new electronic medical record system. Each ED completed staff-developed value stream maps that indicated significant flow issues in intake and triage. Patients were routinely ping-ponged back and forth among registration, triage, and the lobby, sometimes even when physicians were available in the back to see them. The prevailing culture in most of the EDs was that a nurse would always see a patient in the examination room before the physician. The value stream mapping work changed this so that physicians could enter the room at any time and their evaluation of the patient would take precedence.\n\n【78】Other new standards included quick registration (3 minutes) followed by quick triage (3 minutes) followed by the patient going directly to a treatment location. Several of the EDs elected to do all triage at the bedside. Use of the new electronic medical record system to measure and trend all stages of the process and to make performance visible was instrumental in improvements realized across all EDs by 2011: length of stay for discharge patients decreased from 215 to 135 minutes, time to seeing a physician decreased from 55 to 22 minutes, diversion decreased from 1300 hours annually to approximately 50 hours, and patient satisfaction increased from the 60th percentile to the 80th percentile in the national database of a commercial research vendor. The EDs have provided approximately $10 million in incremental income each year since 2009 based on a 2008 baseline. Volume has increased 6% to 7% each year with only a few ED beds added. By the end of 2012, the EDs will have provided more than $6 million in labor productivity gains.\n\n【79】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【80】Lean is an innovative management approach that has proven successful in health care organizations. It offers promise for improving quality and efficiency while controlling costs in the provision of optimum patient care. To implement the Lean philosophy and principles, however, is to undertake an arduous, never-ending improvement journey. Because Lean transforms organizational culture from the inside out, it offers both challenges and opportunities. It requires a major shift in roles: managers and leaders must become facilitators, mentors, and teachers and allow front-line workers to make improvements. It engages the entire staff in identifying and solving problems based on a continuous improvement attitude, the driving force behind Lean work.\n\n【81】The underlying goal of Lean is to improve value for the patient. Innovation through Lean's proven methods provides hope for better health care at less cost rather than worse health care at less cost.

Below we examine these 3 options.\n\n【9】Increase in Energy Intake\n-------------------------\n\n【10】Two major sources of data can be used to address the question of whether average daily energy intake has increased in recent years—food disappearance balance sheets and individual dietary surveys.\n\n【11】### Food Disappearance Balance Sheets\n\n【12】Food disappearance data have been monitored by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for more than a century. (Information on national trends in food consumption can be found on the USDA Web site.\n\n【13】) Food disappearance is estimated from food inventories, domestic food production, food imports and exports, and food used for nonhuman consumption. The assumption is that the food disappears because it is consumed, and it is thus possible to estimate per capita dietary patterns. The trend in energy intake inferred from food disappearance data suggests a decline in consumption in the United States during most of the 20th century, reaching the nadir about 1960 with an increase from then to the 1990s. However, we need to consider the limitations of the food balance sheet method. Food balance sheets represent the theoretical amount of per capita energy available for consumption without taking into consideration the differing physiological needs of different segments of the population. Also, use of the food balance sheet method limits accurate calculation of the amount of waste, especially for fat, a major source of ingested energy, that occurs at both the manufacturing and personal levels. These limitations most likely lead to overestimates of daily per capita energy intake, and this overestimation is likely to have increased over time because of changing practices, especially by consumers.\n\n【14】### Individual Dietary Surveys\n\n【15】Survey data are available on individual dietary practices, including 24-hour dietary recalls or 3-day food records, from representative samples of the US population or from other cohorts. Sources of error for individual-level surveys include incomplete or inaccurate recall, deliberate underestimation by survey participants, and failure to include sufficient probes during the interview or other limitations of survey methods. Estimates of daily energy intake from 2 of the individual-level surveys conducted by the USDA are shown in Figure 2 . The data for all adults reflect a numerical increase in energy intake from the 1977-1978 measurement interval to the 1994-1996 interval; however, the small changes are probably not significant. Further, there was no change in food consumption in the subset of older women and men, even though the prevalence of obesity increased in older persons as well as in the overall population.\n\n【16】Based on data derived from US Department of Agriculture Web site.\n\n【17】Trends in dietary intake have been monitored in other cohorts as well. Three independent cross-sectional surveys were conducted in the Minneapolis-St Paul, Minn, metropolitan area from 1980 to 1992, with 24-hour dietary recalls used to estimate intake.\n\n【18】During this period total energy intake did not change, although the macronutrient composition of the diet changed dramatically, with a reduction in energy from fat and an increase in carbohydrate intake. Despite no change in energy intake and an improved quality of diet, a significant increase in body mass index occurred for both women and men. In a similar study, Prentice and Jebb\n\n【19】reported that in England per capita energy intake actually decreased coincident with an increase in the prevalence of obesity.\n\n【20】### Summary of Energy Intake Trends\n\n【21】Questions about the available data on dietary intake over the past 25 years limit our certainty about whether US adults have increased their daily per capita energy intake. The evidence suggests that energy intake in the United States has not increased during the past 40 years, a period during which the prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically. Furthermore, if energy intake has really increased, the data are not sufficient to provide an accurate estimate of the magnitude of such an increase, and thus quantifying the extent to which possible changes in intake might account for the increase in the prevalence of obesity is impossible. On the basis of the available evidence, we think that the recent increase in the prevalence of obesity is unlikely to be due to increases in daily energy intake.\n\n【22】Decrease in Energy Expenditure\n------------------------------\n\n【23】Has the average per capita daily energy expenditure decreased during the period of increasing prevalence of obesity? Unfortunately, no data are available from representative population samples on average daily energy expenditure. Periodic surveys of self-reported physical activity habits of adults show that the prevalence of sedentary habits, defined as failure to report regular participation in some form of physical activity and the prevalence of participation in various sports and fitness activities, has been constant over the last 25 years of the 20th century.\n\n【24】However, these surveys did not include sufficient detail to estimate total energy expenditure (ie, energy expended not just for sports or fitness activities but for all life activities).\n\n【25】We believe that the average energy expenditure has probably declined, despite the fact that participation in sports and fitness activities appears to have remained constant. Clearly physical activity has decreased because of increasing mechanization on the job, labor-saving devices at home, and changing personal practices.\n\n【26】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【27】Examples of how physical activity has been engineered out of daily life are illustrated in Table 1 . These activities show alternative ways of accomplishing everyday tasks, a sedentary way and an active way. For the 20 activities listed in the table, a person who always chose the sedentary way would expend 1700 kcal over the course of a month and a person who always chose the active way would expend 10,500 kcal over the course of the month, for a difference of 8800 kcal. This difference in expenditure is the energy equivalent of 2½ pounds of body fat, which would equate to 30 pounds in a year. The point of this example is that there are dozens of similar examples for many ordinary activities. Although only a few kilocalories can be related to any specific sedentary activity compared with its active counterpart, the end result is a substantial weight change over time. The positive energy balance leading to the weight gain can occur even in the face of stable or decreasing energy intake and certainly in the instance of higher energy intake. These examples are hypothetical, and as stated above, we do not know what has happened to energy expenditure trends over the past few decades. However, it is reasonable to assume that many of us are becoming increasingly more sedentary.\n\n【28】Table 1 Examples of Sedentary and Active Energy Expenditures for Common Activities\n\n【29】<sup>*</sup>\n\n【30】Data for this table were adapted from Beil.15\n\n| Sedentary | kcal | Active | kcal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Using remote control device to change television channel | <1 | Getting up and changing channel | 3 |\n| Reclining for 30 min of phone calls | 4 | Standing for 3 10-min phone calls | 20 |\n| Using garage door opener | <1 | Raising garage door 2×/d | 2-3 |\n| Hiring someone to clean and iron | 0 | Ironing and vacuuming each for 30 min | 152 |\n| Waiting 30 min for pizza delivery | 15 | Cooking for 30 min | 25 |\n| Buying presliced vegetables | 0 | Washing, slicing, chopping vegetables for 15 min | 10-13 |\n| Using a leaf blower for 30 min | 100 | Raking leaves for 30 min | 150 |\n| Using a lawn service | 0 | Gardening and mowing each for 30 min/wk | 360 |\n| Using car wash 1×/mo | 18 | Washing and waxing car, 1 h/mo | 300 |\n| Letting dog out the back door | 2 | Walking dog for 30 min | 125 |\n| Driving 40 min, walking 5 min (parking) | 22 | Walking 15 min to bus stop 2×/d | 60 |\n| Sending e-mail to colleague, 4 min | 2-3 | Walking 1 min, talking (standing) 3 min | 6 |\n| Taking elevator up 3 flights | 0.3 | Walking up 3 flights | 15 |\n| Parking as close as possible, 10-s walk | 0.3 | Parking in 1st spot, walking 2 min, 5×/wk | 8 |\n| Letting cashier unload shopping cart | 2 | Unloading full shopping cart | 6 |\n| Riding escalator 3× | 2 | Climbing 1 flight of stairs, 3×/wk in mall | 15 |\n| Shopping online 1 h | 30 | Shopping at mall, walking 1 h | 145-240 |\n| Sitting in car at drive-in window, 30 min | 15 | Parking and walking inside, 3×/wk, total of 30 min | 70 |\n| Paying at the pump | 0.6 | Walking into station to pay, 1 ×/wk | 5 |\n| Sitting and listening to lecture, 60 min | 30 | Giving lecture | 70 |\n\n【32】\\* Data for this table were adapted from Beil.\n\n【33】Chakravarthy et al,\n\n【34】in this issue of the _Proceedings,_ present a compelling case for the importance of physical inactivity as a cause of many chronic health conditions.

Regardless of the specific contributions of inactivity to the prevalence of obesity, physicians should aggressively promote activity to their patients. The benefits of activity go well beyond the effect on weight control or on other conventional risk factors for chronic health conditions. We find that a fit and active way of live reduces mortality risk in virtually all subgroups—the middle-aged and the elderly, women and men, the fat and the thin, and those with hypertension and those with normal blood pressure.\n\n【35】Influences of cardiorespiratory fitness and other precursors on cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in men and women.\n\n【36】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【37】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【38】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【39】Summary of Energy Balance Data and Obesity\n------------------------------------------\n\n【40】Other investigators have evaluated both diet and physical activity as predictors of weight change.\n\n【41】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【42】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【43】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【44】In general, changes in dietary measures fail to predict weight change, but changes in various measures of physical activity are significant predictors.

Improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness is a particularly strong predictor of weight loss in these studies. Another important point is that regular physical activity may be especially important for weight control for those with a genetic predisposition for weight gain\n\n【50】or those eating a high-fat diet.\n\n【51】Although the available data have limitations, we believe that the evidence suggests that declines in physical activity are more likely than increases in energy intake as the explanation for the recent increase in obesity prevalence.\n\n【52】Strategies for Dealing With the Increasing Prevalence of Obesity\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】Effective strategies for dealing with the increasing prevalence of obesity depend on a better understanding of the causes. If the causes of the national obesity epidemic were related primarily to increases in energy intake, the appropriate strategy would focus on efforts to get individuals to reduce their energy intake. Conversely, if the causes were attributable primarily to low energy expenditure, a different set of strategies would be required. Given the lack of adequate data to evaluate the options presented here, improved surveillance of both energy intake and energy expenditure will identify more precisely their relative contributions to the development of obesity.

The rapidly increasing prevalence of obesity indicates that a substantial number of individuals have been in positive energy balance. As the energy balance equation has only 2 components, the essential question is, “What is the cause of this positive energy balance?” Is it attributable to (1) an increase in energy intake, (2) a decrease in energy expenditure, or (3) a combination of both? Below we examine these 3 options.\n\n【9】Increase in Energy Intake\n-------------------------\n\n【10】Two major sources of data can be used to address the question of whether average daily energy intake has increased in recent years—food disappearance balance sheets and individual dietary surveys.\n\n【11】### Food Disappearance Balance Sheets\n\n【12】Food disappearance data have been monitored by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for more than a century. (Information on national trends in food consumption can be found on the USDA Web site.\n\n【13】) Food disappearance is estimated from food inventories, domestic food production, food imports and exports, and food used for nonhuman consumption. The assumption is that the food disappears because it is consumed, and it is thus possible to estimate per capita dietary patterns. The trend in energy intake inferred from food disappearance data suggests a decline in consumption in the United States during most of the 20th century, reaching the nadir about 1960 with an increase from then to the 1990s. However, we need to consider the limitations of the food balance sheet method. Food balance sheets represent the theoretical amount of per capita energy available for consumption without taking into consideration the differing physiological needs of different segments of the population. Also, use of the food balance sheet method limits accurate calculation of the amount of waste, especially for fat, a major source of ingested energy, that occurs at both the manufacturing and personal levels. These limitations most likely lead to overestimates of daily per capita energy intake, and this overestimation is likely to have increased over time because of changing practices, especially by consumers.\n\n【14】### Individual Dietary Surveys\n\n【15】Survey data are available on individual dietary practices, including 24-hour dietary recalls or 3-day food records, from representative samples of the US population or from other cohorts. Sources of error for individual-level surveys include incomplete or inaccurate recall, deliberate underestimation by survey participants, and failure to include sufficient probes during the interview or other limitations of survey methods. Estimates of daily energy intake from 2 of the individual-level surveys conducted by the USDA are shown in Figure 2 . The data for all adults reflect a numerical increase in energy intake from the 1977-1978 measurement interval to the 1994-1996 interval; however, the small changes are probably not significant. Further, there was no change in food consumption in the subset of older women and men, even though the prevalence of obesity increased in older persons as well as in the overall population.\n\n【16】Based on data derived from US Department of Agriculture Web site.\n\n【17】Trends in dietary intake have been monitored in other cohorts as well. Three independent cross-sectional surveys were conducted in the Minneapolis-St Paul, Minn, metropolitan area from 1980 to 1992, with 24-hour dietary recalls used to estimate intake.\n\n【18】During this period total energy intake did not change, although the macronutrient composition of the diet changed dramatically, with a reduction in energy from fat and an increase in carbohydrate intake. Despite no change in energy intake and an improved quality of diet, a significant increase in body mass index occurred for both women and men. In a similar study, Prentice and Jebb\n\n【19】reported that in England per capita energy intake actually decreased coincident with an increase in the prevalence of obesity.\n\n【20】### Summary of Energy Intake Trends\n\n【21】Questions about the available data on dietary intake over the past 25 years limit our certainty about whether US adults have increased their daily per capita energy intake. The evidence suggests that energy intake in the United States has not increased during the past 40 years, a period during which the prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically. Furthermore, if energy intake has really increased, the data are not sufficient to provide an accurate estimate of the magnitude of such an increase, and thus quantifying the extent to which possible changes in intake might account for the increase in the prevalence of obesity is impossible. On the basis of the available evidence, we think that the recent increase in the prevalence of obesity is unlikely to be due to increases in daily energy intake.\n\n【22】Decrease in Energy Expenditure\n------------------------------\n\n【23】Has the average per capita daily energy expenditure decreased during the period of increasing prevalence of obesity? Unfortunately, no data are available from representative population samples on average daily energy expenditure. Periodic surveys of self-reported physical activity habits of adults show that the prevalence of sedentary habits, defined as failure to report regular participation in some form of physical activity and the prevalence of participation in various sports and fitness activities, has been constant over the last 25 years of the 20th century.\n\n【24】However, these surveys did not include sufficient detail to estimate total energy expenditure (ie, energy expended not just for sports or fitness activities but for all life activities).\n\n【25】We believe that the average energy expenditure has probably declined, despite the fact that participation in sports and fitness activities appears to have remained constant. Clearly physical activity has decreased because of increasing mechanization on the job, labor-saving devices at home, and changing personal practices.\n\n【26】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【27】Examples of how physical activity has been engineered out of daily life are illustrated in Table 1 . These activities show alternative ways of accomplishing everyday tasks, a sedentary way and an active way. For the 20 activities listed in the table, a person who always chose the sedentary way would expend 1700 kcal over the course of a month and a person who always chose the active way would expend 10,500 kcal over the course of the month, for a difference of 8800 kcal. This difference in expenditure is the energy equivalent of 2½ pounds of body fat, which would equate to 30 pounds in a year. The point of this example is that there are dozens of similar examples for many ordinary activities. Although only a few kilocalories can be related to any specific sedentary activity compared with its active counterpart, the end result is a substantial weight change over time. The positive energy balance leading to the weight gain can occur even in the face of stable or decreasing energy intake and certainly in the instance of higher energy intake. These examples are hypothetical, and as stated above, we do not know what has happened to energy expenditure trends over the past few decades. However, it is reasonable to assume that many of us are becoming increasingly more sedentary.\n\n【28】Table 1 Examples of Sedentary and Active Energy Expenditures for Common Activities\n\n【29】<sup>*</sup>\n\n<mark>【30】Data for this table were adapted from Beil.15\n\n</mark>| Sedentary | kcal | Active | kcal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Using remote control device to change television channel | <1 | Getting up and changing channel | 3 |\n| Reclining for 30 min of phone calls | 4 | Standing for 3 10-min phone calls | 20 |\n| Using garage door opener | <1 | Raising garage door 2×/d | 2-3 |\n| Hiring someone to clean and iron | 0 | Ironing and vacuuming each for 30 min | 152 |\n| Waiting 30 min for pizza delivery | 15 | Cooking for 30 min | 25 |\n| Buying presliced vegetables | 0 | Washing, slicing, chopping vegetables for 15 min | 10-13 |\n| Using a leaf blower for 30 min | 100 | Raking leaves for 30 min | 150 |\n| Using a lawn service | 0 | Gardening and mowing each for 30 min/wk | 360 |\n| Using car wash 1×/mo | 18 | Washing and waxing car, 1 h/mo | 300 |\n| Letting dog out the back door | 2 | Walking dog for 30 min | 125 |\n| Driving 40 min, walking 5 min (parking) | 22 | Walking 15 min to bus stop 2×/d | 60 |\n| Sending e-mail to colleague, 4 min | 2-3 | Walking 1 min, talking (standing) 3 min | 6 |\n| Taking elevator up 3 flights | 0.3 | Walking up 3 flights | 15 |\n| Parking as close as possible, 10-s walk | 0.3 | Parking in 1st spot, walking 2 min, 5×/wk | 8 |\n| Letting cashier unload shopping cart | 2 | Unloading full shopping cart | 6 |\n| Riding escalator 3× | 2 | Climbing 1 flight of stairs, 3×/wk in mall | 15 |\n| Shopping online 1 h | 30 | Shopping at mall, walking 1 h | 145-240 |\n| Sitting in car at drive-in window, 30 min | 15 | Parking and walking inside, 3×/wk, total of 30 min | 70 |\n| Paying at the pump | 0.6 | Walking into station to pay, 1 ×/wk | 5 |\n| Sitting and listening to lecture, 60 min | 30 | Giving lecture | 70 |\n\n【32】\\* Data for this table were adapted from Beil.\n\n【33】Chakravarthy et al,\n\n【34】in this issue of the _Proceedings,_ present a compelling case for the importance of physical inactivity as a cause of many chronic health conditions.

If the causes of the national obesity epidemic were related primarily to increases in energy intake, the appropriate strategy would focus on efforts to get individuals to reduce their energy intake. Conversely, if the causes were attributable primarily to low energy expenditure, a different set of strategies would be required. Given the lack of adequate data to evaluate the options presented here, improved surveillance of both energy intake and energy expenditure will identify more precisely their relative contributions to the development of obesity.

Obesity is defined as a body mass index of 30.0 kg/m 删除19:<u><sup>2 </sup></u> or higher. The data are taken from Mokdad et al.\n\n【7】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【8】The fundamental cause of weight gain is energy intake that persistently exceeds energy expenditure. The rapidly increasing prevalence of obesity indicates that a substantial number of individuals have been in positive energy balance. As the energy balance equation has only 2 components, the essential question is, “What is the cause of this positive energy balance?” Is it attributable to (1) an increase in energy intake, (2) a decrease in energy expenditure, or (3) a combination of both? Below we examine these 3 options.\n\n【9】Increase in Energy Intake\n-------------------------\n\n【10】Two major sources of data can be used to address the question of whether average daily energy intake has increased in recent years—food disappearance balance sheets and individual dietary surveys.\n\n【11】### Food Disappearance Balance Sheets\n\n【12】Food disappearance data have been monitored by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) for more than a century. (Information on national trends in food consumption can be found on the USDA Web site.\n\n【13】) Food disappearance is estimated from food inventories, domestic food production, food imports and exports, and food used for nonhuman consumption. The assumption is that the food disappears because it is consumed, and it is thus possible to estimate per capita dietary patterns. The trend in energy intake inferred from food disappearance data suggests a decline in consumption in the United States during most of the 20th century, reaching the nadir about 1960 with an increase from then to the 1990s. However, we need to consider the limitations of the food balance sheet method. Food balance sheets represent the theoretical amount of per capita energy available for consumption without taking into consideration the differing physiological needs of different segments of the population. Also, use of the food balance sheet method limits accurate calculation of the amount of waste, especially for fat, a major source of ingested energy, that occurs at both the manufacturing and personal levels. These limitations most likely lead to overestimates of daily per capita energy intake, and this overestimation is likely to have increased over time because of changing practices, especially by consumers.\n\n【14】### Individual Dietary Surveys\n\n【15】Survey data are available on individual dietary practices, including 24-hour dietary recalls or 3-day food records, from representative samples of the US population or from other cohorts. Sources of error for individual-level surveys include incomplete or inaccurate recall, deliberate underestimation by survey participants, and failure to include sufficient probes during the interview or other limitations of survey methods. Estimates of daily energy intake from 2 of the individual-level surveys conducted by the USDA are shown in Figure 2 . The data for all adults reflect a numerical increase in energy intake from the 1977-1978 measurement interval to the 1994-1996 interval; however, the small changes are probably not significant. Further, there was no change in food consumption in the subset of older women and men, even though the prevalence of obesity increased in older persons as well as in the overall population.\n\n【16】Based on data derived from US Department of Agriculture Web site.\n\n【17】Trends in dietary intake have been monitored in other cohorts as well. Three independent cross-sectional surveys were conducted in the Minneapolis-St Paul, Minn, metropolitan area from 1980 to 1992, with 24-hour dietary recalls used to estimate intake.\n\n【18】During this period total energy intake did not change, although the macronutrient composition of the diet changed dramatically, with a reduction in energy from fat and an increase in carbohydrate intake. Despite no change in energy intake and an improved quality of diet, a significant increase in body mass index occurred for both women and men. In a similar study, Prentice and Jebb\n\n【19】reported that in England per capita energy intake actually decreased coincident with an increase in the prevalence of obesity.\n\n【20】### Summary of Energy Intake Trends\n\n【21】Questions about the available data on dietary intake over the past 25 years limit our certainty about whether US adults have increased their daily per capita energy intake. The evidence suggests that energy intake in the United States has not increased during the past 40 years, a period during which the prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically. Furthermore, if energy intake has really increased, the data are not sufficient to provide an accurate estimate of the magnitude of such an increase, and thus quantifying the extent to which possible changes in intake might account for the increase in the prevalence of obesity is impossible. On the basis of the available evidence, we think that the recent increase in the prevalence of obesity is unlikely to be due to increases in daily energy intake.\n\n【22】Decrease in Energy Expenditure\n------------------------------\n\n【23】Has the average per capita daily energy expenditure decreased during the period of increasing prevalence of obesity? Unfortunately, no data are available from representative population samples on average daily energy expenditure. Periodic surveys of self-reported physical activity habits of adults show that the prevalence of sedentary habits, defined as failure to report regular participation in some form of physical activity and the prevalence of participation in various sports and fitness activities, has been constant over the last 25 years of the 20th century.\n\n【24】However, these surveys did not include sufficient detail to estimate total energy expenditure (ie, energy expended not just for sports or fitness activities but for all life activities).\n\n【25】We believe that the average energy expenditure has probably declined, despite the fact that participation in sports and fitness activities appears to have remained constant. Clearly physical activity has decreased because of increasing mechanization on the job, labor-saving devices at home, and changing personal practices.\n\n【26】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【27】Examples of how physical activity has been engineered out of daily life are illustrated in Table 1 . These activities show alternative ways of accomplishing everyday tasks, a sedentary way and an active way. For the 20 activities listed in the table, a person who always chose the sedentary way would expend 1700 kcal over the course of a month and a person who always chose the active way would expend 10,500 kcal over the course of the month, for a difference of 8800 kcal. This difference in expenditure is the energy equivalent of 2½ pounds of body fat, which would equate to 30 pounds in a year. The point of this example is that there are dozens of similar examples for many ordinary activities. Although only a few kilocalories can be related to any specific sedentary activity compared with its active counterpart, the end result is a substantial weight change over time. The positive energy balance leading to the weight gain can occur even in the face of stable or decreasing energy intake and certainly in the instance of higher energy intake. These examples are hypothetical, and as stated above, we do not know what has happened to energy expenditure trends over the past few decades. However, it is reasonable to assume that many of us are becoming increasingly more sedentary.\n\n【28】Table 1 Examples of Sedentary and Active Energy Expenditures for Common Activities\n\n【29】<sup>*</sup>\n\n<mark>【30】Data for this table were adapted from Beil.15\n\n</mark>| Sedentary | kcal | Active | kcal |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Using remote control device to change television channel | <1 | Getting up and changing channel | 3 |\n| Reclining for 30 min of phone calls | 4 | Standing for 3 10-min phone calls | 20 |\n| Using garage door opener | <1 | Raising garage door 2×/d | 2-3 |\n| Hiring someone to clean and iron | 0 | Ironing and vacuuming each for 30 min | 152 |\n| Waiting 30 min for pizza delivery | 15 | Cooking for 30 min | 25 |\n| Buying presliced vegetables | 0 | Washing, slicing, chopping vegetables for 15 min | 10-13 |\n| Using a leaf blower for 30 min | 100 | Raking leaves for 30 min | 150 |\n| Using a lawn service | 0 | Gardening and mowing each for 30 min/wk | 360 |\n| Using car wash 1×/mo | 18 | Washing and waxing car, 1 h/mo | 300 |\n| Letting dog out the back door | 2 | Walking dog for 30 min | 125 |\n| Driving 40 min, walking 5 min (parking) | 22 | Walking 15 min to bus stop 2×/d | 60 |\n| Sending e-mail to colleague, 4 min | 2-3 | Walking 1 min, talking (standing) 3 min | 6 |\n| Taking elevator up 3 flights | 0.3 | Walking up 3 flights | 15 |\n| Parking as close as possible, 10-s walk | 0.3 | Parking in 1st spot, walking 2 min, 5×/wk | 8 |\n| Letting cashier unload shopping cart | 2 | Unloading full shopping cart | 6 |\n| Riding escalator 3× | 2 | Climbing 1 flight of stairs, 3×/wk in mall | 15 |\n| Shopping online 1 h | 30 | Shopping at mall, walking 1 h | 145-240 |\n| Sitting in car at drive-in window, 30 min | 15 | Parking and walking inside, 3×/wk, total of 30 min | 70 |\n| Paying at the pump | 0.6 | Walking into station to pay, 1 ×/wk | 5 |\n| Sitting and listening to lecture, 60 min | 30 | Giving lecture | 70 |\n\n【32】\\* Data for this table were adapted from Beil.\n\n【33】Chakravarthy et al,\n\n【34】in this issue of the _Proceedings,_ present a compelling case for the importance of physical inactivity as a cause of many chronic health conditions. Human beings did not evolve to live in an environment where food is available everywhere at low cost and where physical activity has been engineered out of daily life. Regardless of the specific contributions of inactivity to the prevalence of obesity, physicians should aggressively promote activity to their patients. The benefits of activity go well beyond the effect on weight control or on other conventional risk factors for chronic health conditions. We find that a fit and active way of live reduces mortality risk in virtually all subgroups—the middle-aged and the elderly, women and men, the fat and the thin, and those with hypertension and those with normal blood pressure.\n\n【35】Influences of cardiorespiratory fitness and other precursors on cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in men and women.\n\n【36】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【37】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【38】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【39】Summary of Energy Balance Data and Obesity\n------------------------------------------\n\n【40】Other investigators have evaluated both diet and physical activity as predictors of weight change.\n\n【41】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【42】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【43】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【44】In general, changes in dietary measures fail to predict weight change, but changes in various measures of physical activity are significant predictors.

All these studies show that regular participation in physical activity or increases in activity are associated with low weight gain or actual weight loss over time. Improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness is a particularly strong predictor of weight loss in these studies. Another important point is that regular physical activity may be especially important for weight control for those with a genetic predisposition for weight gain\n\n【50】or those eating a high-fat diet.\n\n【51】Although the available data have limitations, we believe that the evidence suggests that declines in physical activity are more likely than increases in energy intake as the explanation for the recent increase in obesity prevalence.\n\n【52】Strategies for Dealing With the Increasing Prevalence of Obesity\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】Effective strategies for dealing with the increasing prevalence of obesity depend on a better understanding of the causes. If the causes of the national obesity epidemic were related primarily to increases in energy intake, the appropriate strategy would focus on efforts to get individuals to reduce their energy intake. Conversely, if the causes were attributable primarily to low energy expenditure, a different set of strategies would be required. Given the lack of adequate data to evaluate the options presented here, improved surveillance of both energy intake and energy expenditure will identify more precisely their relative contributions to the development of obesity. However, regardless of the specific contributions of energy intake and energy expenditure to the development of obesity, intervention strategies emphasizing both a healthful diet and regular physical activity are indicated.\n\n【54】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【55】Current guidelines present a clear consensus of what the content of these interventions should be.

We have made our recommendations to discontinue or continue a dietary supplement based on the principle that without a demonstrated benefit, or with a demonstrated lack of harm, there is little downside in temporarily discontinuing an herbal supplement before surgery. Discussion with patients in the preoperative visit is a crucial time to educate patients as well as gather vital information. Patients should be specifically asked about use of dietary supplements and cannabinoids, as many will not volunteer this information.

Thus, the actual content, purity, and efficacy of these products are often unclear.\n\n【7】Approximately one-third of adults in the United States report the use of one or more of these products (hereafter referred to as supplements).\n\n【8】The widespread use of supplements with varying levels of evidence for safety and efficacy poses challenges for health care providers.\n\n【9】These supplements have many effects on various organ systems as well as the potential for significant drug interactions.\n\n【10】Clinicians simply inquiring about supplement use, however, appears to be effective in promoting patient disclosure.\n\n【11】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【12】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【13】Prior reviews have focused on specific issues or surveyed subsets of available dietary supplements.\n\n【14】Given the large number of supplements available, the prevalence of supplement use, and the potential they may pose for increased perioperative risk, the Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) convened a group of experts in the fields of internal medicine and anesthesiology to assess the available evidence and provide recommendations for the preoperative management of a more comprehensive list of dietary supplements.\n\n【15】Methods\n-------\n\n【16】A modified Delphi method was used to obtain input from a group of experts in anesthesiology and perioperative medicine regarding the use of dietary supplements. The Delphi method was selected due to the known lack of high-level evidence related to the perioperative management of herbal supplements. Specifically, the goal was to define the period of time (if necessary) to hold the supplement before surgery. We chose the methodology described by the American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, in its 2015 consensus statement, with some modifications necessitated by our topic and participants.\n\n【17】The topic for our consensus statement was chosen by SPAQI, based on a lack of standardized care and evidence related to the preoperative use of supplements. Group members were similarly selected for their understanding and expertise on the topic as well as their grasp of evidence-based medicine. Group members came from the fields of anesthesiology and internal medicine. In addition, a group leader was appointed to lead the group with the approval of the SPAQI executive committee. The final group consisted of eight experts.\n\n【18】A comprehensive list of supplements was identified by literature search of primary and secondary sources plus input from the group members. Supplements were divided into the following groups based upon the main perioperative concerns associated with their use: increased bleeding risk, potentiation of central nervous system (CNS) depression, decreased blood glucose, cardiovascular effects, serotonin metabolism, and multiple drug interactions. Cannabis preparations were also evaluated as a separate category.\n\n【19】In the first Delphi round, each group member was asked whether each individual supplement should be taken preoperatively. Group members were asked to rate the supplement as either “Take,” “Hold,” or “It Depends” using a 9-point Likert scale. The Likert scale used the anchors: 1 = strongly agree, 3 = disagree, 5 = neutral, 7 = agree, and 9 = strongly agree.\n\n【20】Responses were returned to the group leader who collated the results and distributed the anonymous results back to group members. Definitions for consensus were determined by SPAQI before the start of the process and are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【21】Table 1 Categorization of Consensus\n\n| Category | Mean score |  | OutliersaOutliers are defined as any rating ≥2 Likert points from the mean (in either direction). |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Consensus | \\>7.0 | And | ≤1 |\n| Near consensus | ≥6.5 | And | ≤2 |\n| No consensus | <6.5 | Or | ≥3 |\n\n【23】a Outliers are defined as any rating ≥2 Likert points from the mean (in either direction).\n\n【24】Next, a literature search was conducted with each group of supplements assigned to a specific group member or members. The literature search encompassed primary research or summary articles from the last 10 years, human studies, English language, perioperative management (including preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative), and adult (age 18 years and older). This included both primary (PubMed, package inserts, Micromedex, and others) and secondary (review articles) literature. The literature returned was evaluated by the group member responsible for that drug class, summarized, and the full text provided for distribution to other members when relevant.\n\n【25】After the results of the review were collated and disseminated to the group, a second survey was conducted. Comments were encouraged from the group members to explain differences of opinion on the small minority of supplements where consensus was not reached. The results and comments from the surveys and literature reviews were then discussed via conference call, and draft recommendations were agreed upon. A draft list of recommended perioperative management for the list of supplements was circulated to the group and approved by all members. A final survey was then conducted to verify consensus.\n\n【26】Recommendations\n---------------\n\n【27】A total of 83 supplements were identified by the group. The entire list with specific details is presented alphabetically in Table 2 . Recommendations by specific perioperative concern are presented below. Some supplements have multiple considerations and are therefore included in more than one category. Because of the enormous number of combination products, supplements with multiple ingredients were not specifically evaluated. If a combination product contains a supplement the group recommends to hold, the combination should be held. The recommended duration to hold each supplement was extrapolated from pharmacokinetic data, if available. For many supplements, this information is not available. When insufficient data were available and there was no convincing evidence for harm from holding a supplement (such as withdrawal syndromes or pharmacologic interactions), the group adopted a conservative default recommendation of 2 weeks, consistent with recommendations by the Natural Medicines database managed by the Therapeutic Research Center.\n\n【28】In some cases, drug interactions are a significant concern (such as St John’s wort, grapefruit extract, and _Echinacea_ ). In these cases, clinicians are advised to consider the effects of removing the supplement on other medications the patient may be taking.\n\n【29】Table 2 Supplements, Mechanisms, and Recommendations\n\n【30】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【31】CNS = central nervous system; COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FDA = US Food and Drug Administration; GLUT4 = glucose transporter type 4; INR = international normalized ratio; NO = nitric oxide; RCT = randomized controlled trial; SPAQI = Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement.\n\n| Supplement | Continue/hold/depends | Additional considerations |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n| Cannabidiol Preparations | Discontinue. SPAQI does not recommend use of cannabidiol preparations.Does not apply to FDA- approved formulation used for epilepsy syndromes. | Little evidence for efficacy of available preparations.Shown to interact or interfere with a number of endocannabinoid and non-endocannabinoid signaling systems.Concern for antiplatelet effect. |\n\n| S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) | Hold 24 hours. | Thought to increase serotonin turnover, increases norepinephrine and dopamine activity.Increases cycling in bipolar disorder. |\n\n| Yerba mate | Hold 2 weeks.

Regardless of recommendations to hold supplements, patients will often present for surgery having continued to use them. Because of a dearth of outcome data, an individualized approach is then recommended involving discussion between the surgeon, anesthesiologist, and any other involved clinicians. For example, in a surgical procedure in which bleeding would be dangerous (eg, intracranial surgery, spine fusion, or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy), postponing the procedure may be the best course if the patient remained on a supplement associated with increased bleeding. For lower-risk procedures, cautiously proceeding with surgery is likely a reasonable choice. Analogously, patients taking medications that may decrease blood glucose could reasonably undergo surgery as long as their perioperative teams have increased vigilance in perioperative glucose monitoring.\n\n【38】### Supplements That May Affect Bleeding Risk\n\n【39】Due to varying metabolism and uncertainty about drug clearance, the group recommends that the following should ideally be held for 2 weeks before surgery: aloe, arnica, boldo, bromelain, cat’s claw, danshen, devil’s claw, dong quai, evodia, fenugreek, feverfew, garlic, ginger, ginkgo, ginseng (American, _Panax_ , and Siberian), guarana, horse chestnut, policosanol, resveratrol, saw palmetto, turmeric, vanadium, and vitamin E.\n\n【40】Chondroitin and glucosamine may be held for 48 hours due to a more rapid metabolism and shorter elimination half-life.\n\n【41】Black tea extract may increase bleeding risk, so it is recommended to hold for 2 weeks before surgery or at least taper the dose. Black tea as a beverage is safe to consume up to the day of surgery. Green tea extract may be continued until surgery: while it may increase bleeding risk, the catechins in green tea extract improve diastolic cardiac function.\n\n【42】Fish oil/omega-3 fatty acid preparations should be continued. Prior concerns about bleeding risk have not been borne out in prospective studies.\n\n【43】Fish oil and perioperative bleeding.\n\n【44】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【45】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【46】### Supplements That May Cause CNS Depression\n\n【47】Due to the lack of information about their pharmacokinetics, and their known potential to exacerbate CNS depression in the perioperative period, the group believes the following should ideally be held for 2 weeks before surgery: Kava, lemon balm, and skullcap.\n\n【48】Theanine and L-tryptophan may also cause CNS depression, but due to their rapid metabolism, they may be held for 24 hours before surgery.\n\n【49】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【50】Kinetics of L-theanine uptake and metabolism in healthy participants are comparable after ingestion of L-theanine via capsules and green tea.\n\n【51】The following supplements can be continued as they may provide benefit in the perioperative period due to their action as anxiolytics: German chamomile, melatonin, and passionflower.\n\n【52】Valerian can be continued as it appears to be a safe supplement that may protect against cognitive dysfunction in the perioperative period.\n\n【53】Can Valeriana officinalis root extract prevent early postoperative cognitive dysfunction after CABG surgery? A randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial.\n\n【54】Consider continuing lavender extract and hops as there is no convincing evidence that they can cause significant interactions with other CNS depressants.\n\n【55】### Supplements That May Affect Blood Glucose\n\n【56】Due to lack of data, the group recommends that the following should ideally be held for 2 weeks before surgery: _Agaricus_ mushroom, aloe, alpha-lipoic acid, American ginseng, banaba, bitter melon, Cassia cinnamon, chromium, fenugreek, glucomannan, _Gymnema_ , _Panax ginseng_ , prickly pear cactus, and vanadium.\n\n【57】In the event that patients did not stop using one of these supplements, clinicians may consider proceeding with surgery with close glucose monitoring.\n\n【58】### Supplements That May Have Cardiovascular Effects\n\n【59】Dimethylamylamine and _Ephedra_ are not recommended for use due to their deleterious cardiac effects and should be discontinued.\n\n【60】These supplements are prohibited for sale by the FDA due to concern about their cardiovascular effects.\n\n【61】The following should ideally be held 2 weeks before surgery: _Andrographis_ , bitter orange, casein peptides, coenzyme Q10, danshen, garlic, guarana, horny goat weed, kola nut, licorice root, nettle, pycnogenol, yerba mate, and yohimbine.\n\n【62】L-arginine and N-acetylcysteine should be held for 24 hours due to concern about their theoretical potential for increased production of nitric oxide which could increase the risk of intraoperative hypotension. Again, theanine may be held for 24 hours.\n\n【63】Given their stimulant properties and potential for hindering glucose metabolism, caffeine supplements and kola nut preparations should ideally be tapered and/or discontinued 2 weeks before surgery. Caffeine use in the form of coffee or tea as a beverage is safe, but physicians should be aware if the patient regularly consumes caffeine.\n\n【64】### Supplements That May Affect Serotonin Levels\n\n【65】St John’s wort should be held for 2 weeks due to multiple constituents with long half-lives (such as hypericin) as well as its known effect of inducing cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) which may reduce plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by this enzyme.\n\n【66】5-hydroxytryptophan, L-tryptophan, and S-adenosylmethionine should be held for 24 hours before surgery due to fairly rapid metabolism and short elimination half-lives. If these agents are continued up to the day of surgery, caution is warranted when using medications with serotonergic activity (such as meperidine or tramadol).\n\n【67】### Supplements With Multiple Potential Effects or Drug Interactions\n\n【68】The use of _Garcinia cambogia_ and kratom is not recommended by SPAQI due to potential for serious adverse effects. They should be discontinued if possible. _Garcinia cambogia_ contains hydroxycitric acid, an ingredient associated with hepatotoxicity.\n\n【69】Kratom has opioid agonist properties (among other effects) and should be tapered due to the potential for withdrawal; the FDA has warned against its use.\n\n【70】The following should ideally be held for 2 weeks: _Echinacea_ , feverfew, goldenseal, grapefruit extract, hu zhang, indole-3-carbinol, ipriflavone, nettle, quercetin, red clover, and _Schisandra_ (which could be continued if using with immunosuppressants).\n\n【71】Wuzhi tablet (Schisandra sphenanthera Extract) is a promising tacrolimus-sparing agent for renal transplant recipients who are CYP3A5 expressers: a two- phase prospective study.\n\n【72】Phenylalanine supplements may be continued as it has anabolic effect in patients with lung disease and there is no convincing evidence of adverse effects.\n\n【73】### Cannabis and Derivatives\n\n【74】The possession and use of marijuana products (cannabis derivatives) is still illegal under United States federal law. SPAQI does not recommend the use of either marijuana or hemp-derived (cannabidiol) products. Ideally, use of these substances should be discontinued. Cannabinoids have a multitude of physiological effects including sympathetic hyperactivity with acute use, airway irritability in marijuana smokers, impaired temperature regulation, interaction with anesthetic drugs, and an increased risk of perioperative coronary vasospasm.\n\n【75】The group recommends that, at a minimum, elective surgery should preferably not occur within 3 days of use. Ideally, the period of abstinence would be longer (2 weeks) to reduce airway irritability in those who smoke.\n\n【76】This recommendation does not apply to FDA-approved drugs used for recognized indications such as chemotherapy-induced nausea or rare epilepsy syndromes.\n\n【77】### Restarting Supplements After Surgery\n\n【78】When to restart the use of supplements is a broad topic, and it is outside of the scope of this document. In general, however, similar considerations to any other medication should apply to each supplement on a case-by-case basis. For example, supplements that impair coagulation should be restarted only once the risk of postoperative bleeding is minimal.\n\n【79】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【80】The preceding list provides a useful guideline for understanding the potential unintended effects of many dietary supplements. High-quality randomized controlled trials are essential for best guiding patients about the use of these supplements preoperatively and indeed informed our recommendation for the continuation of fish oil/omega-3 fatty acids and several supplements used for anxiety and sleep. This level of evidence, however, was not available for the majority of products we researched. We have made our recommendations to discontinue or continue a dietary supplement based on the principle that without a demonstrated benefit, or with a demonstrated lack of harm, temporarily discontinuing a supplement is usually a safer course than continuing it during the perioperative period. We have also taken the position that any substance which is illegal or banned by the FDA poses an inherent risk to the patient.\n\n【81】Discussion with patients in the preoperative visit is a crucial time to educate patients as well as gather vital information. Patients should be specifically asked about use of dietary supplements and cannabinoids, as many will not volunteer this information without being asked. The preoperative clinic visit is also the best opportunity to educate patients about preoperative supplement management as it is the only visit that is most consistently close to 2 weeks before the procedure.\n\n【82】As perioperative medicine research expands, there is an opportunity for the role of dietary supplements to be clarified in this setting. Potential research targets include perioperative benefits or harms of specific dietary supplements, performance of dietary supplements against pharmaceuticals designed to have a similar effect, and the impact on outcomes in patients who adhere or do not adhere to recommendations.\n\n【83】In conclusion, the popularity of dietary supplements among patients warrants the perioperative physician having an understanding of the potential impact of these supplements around surgery as well as holding an open discussion of their effects with the patient.

Patients in whom ARDS developed during their hospital stay (cases) were matched to similar-risk patients without ARDS (controls) by 6 characteristics: age, sex, sepsis, high-risk surgery, ratio of oxygen saturation to fraction of inspired oxygen, and ARDS risk according to the Lung Injury Prediction Score.

From July 2009 to October 2010, parents reported children's weekly organized leisure-time sports participation via text messaging. Clustered cardiovascular risk was estimated with a composite score comprising fasting serum triglyceride levels, homeostasis assessment model-estimated insulin resistance, total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, and systolic blood pressure. Additional outcomes were body mass index categories and fasting serum insulin and glucose concentrations. Associations were explored with generalized estimating equations and reported with beta coefficients ( _β_ ) and percent difference per weekly sports session or incidence rate ratios. All models were adjusted for baseline values and other potential confounders.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In total, 1197 children (53% female) with a mean age of 8.4±1.4 years were included. Participating in sports for 53 weeks was associated with lower clustered cardiovascular risk ( _β_ , −0.25; 95% CI, −0.41 to −0.10; percent difference, 3.2%; 95% CI, 5.2%-1.3%). Similar outcomes were observed for log homeostasis assessment model-estimated insulin resistance ( _β_ , −0.08; 95% CI, −0.12 to −0.04; percent difference, 3.4%; 5.1%-1.7%) and log insulin ( _β_ , −0.07; 95% CI, −0.11 to −0.04; percent difference, 2.6%; 95% CI, 4.0%-1.5%). Sports participation was associated with a 20% decreased risk of overweight/obesity (incidence rate ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.96).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Participating in organized leisure-time sports for approximately 1 year is associated with decreased clustered cardiovascular risk in children.

These findings suggest that altered immune responses during acute malaria may influence hepatitis B viremia. However, there is no convincing evidence of exacerbation of underlying hepatitis B-related liver disease during acute falciparum malaria infection. Further studies are needed to clarify the effect of underlying hepatitis B infection on acute falciparum malaria and vice versa. Furthermore, both of the aforementioned studies suffered from selection bias and lacked a control arm.\n\n【6】The levels of alkaline phosphatase were high in both groups we reported, and the difference was not statistically significant (263.1 ± 29.32 vs 321.48 ± 61.57; _P_ \\=.14).", "index": 72, "show": true, "start": 72, "end": 165, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/27 09:48:11", "endTime": "2024/08/27 09:48:45", "cost": 33.49}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:31", "update_time": "2024-08-26 17:48:43", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 17:48:09"}

US Dept of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service , Rockville, MD 2000</u>\n\n【11】To increase the likelihood of addressing tobacco use, clinicians should have this information available before they meet with the patient.\n\n【12】### Chronic Disease Model\n\n【13】Permanent tobacco abstinence, the goal of intervention, is rarely achieved with a single treatment. Instead, the quitting process is characterized by relapses and remissions and is best conceptualized using a chronic illness model.\n\n【14】Just as we would not consider discontinuing antidiabetic agents for a patient whose hemoglobin A <sub>1c </sub> was not at goal, we should not discontinue treating patients who relapse to smoking.\n\n【15】Some smokers can achieve long-term tobacco abstinence (>6 months) after a few attempts or even after only one. However, many others try to quit multiple times and relapse. Indeed, relapse is the most likely outcome from any single quit attempt. Most patients will not reach 6 months of abstinence without relapsing, and half of those abstinent at 6 months will relapse during the subsequent 8 years.\n\n【16】Like patients with poorly controlled hypertension or diabetes, patients who relapse to smoking should be reengaged in treatment. Medication adjustments and behavioral support should be provided until acceptable therapeutic targets, eg, long-term smoking abstinence, are met.\n\n【17】Promoting repeat tobacco dependence treatment: are relapsed smokers interested?\n\n【18】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【19】Clinicians can foster confidence in these patients and make them more willing to reengage in treatment by providing consistent screening at follow-up visits and offering new and combined medication options.\n\n【20】### Starting the Conversation: Scaling Questions\n\n【21】Patients who are advised to quit smoking by clinicians are more likely to do so and report higher satisfaction with clinical encounters.\n\n【22】删除21:<u>Clinical Practice Guideline: Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. US Dept of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service , Rockville, MD 2000</u>\n\n【23】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【24】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【25】In busy clinical practices, most patients are asked about smoking and advised to quit, but many fewer receive assistance in quitting or referral to a tobacco treatment specialist.\n\n【26】Clinicians may not engage patients in these more in-depth discussions because they do not know how to begin the conversation. To start a dialogue, we ask: “Can we talk about your tobacco use?” If patients wish to engage in this discussion, we use scaling questions, ie, questions that allow the patients to respond using a scale of 0 to 10, to determine their motivation to make a quit attempt by assessing the importance they place on quitting (“On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not important at all, how important is it for you to stop smoking?”) and their confidence in their ability to do so (“On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being not confident at all, how confident are you in your ability to stop smoking?”). The answers to these questions allow the more relevant domain (ie, lower score) to be addressed.\n\n【27】Clinicians can obtain even more precise information by following up on the patients' answers to the initial questions. For example, if patients assign a value of 3 to the importance they place on quitting, the clinician might ask: “I notice that you are a 3 on the importance scale; why are you not a 0?” Asking patients why they are not lower on the scale can give insight into their own reasons for wanting change, reasons that will likely motivate them more than any the clinician could provide. If patients determine their confidence level to be a 5, the clinician might ask why it is not a 2. Patients can then provide details about what makes them confident that they could make a quit attempt (eg, previously successful quit attempts). Past achievements can be the foundation of future success. The clinician can then elicit from patients what might help to build confidence and skills for quitting smoking by asking: “What would it take to move you to a 7 on the confidence scale?”\n\n【28】With this information, the clinician can personalize a message about becoming tobacco free, educate patients about new treatment options, and identify tools and coping skills to help patients adhere to treatment. This type of patient-centered approach can enhance the working alliance, establish rapport, and facilitate the development of a targeted treatment plan. It can also help the patient reengage in treatment if relapse occurs.\n\n【29】The impact of patient-centered care on outcomes.\n\n【30】If patients are willing to make a quit attempt, treatment should be sufficiently intense to maximize the likelihood of success. Medications can be used to address withdrawal symptoms and reduce the intensity of conditioned responses so that patients can more effectively implement behavior changes.\n\n【31】NICOTINE FOR TREATING TOBACCO DEPENDENCE\n----------------------------------------\n\n【32】All available pharmacotherapies indicated for the treatment of tobacco dependence can be used effectively as monotherapies, and such an approach is appropriate for lighter smokers (>10 cigarettes per day). Our general approach to treating nicotine withdrawal symptoms in moderate and heavy smokers (>10 cigarettes per day) is to offer combination treatment, eg, the nicotine patch to provide continuous dosing and 1 of the short-acting nicotine replacement products (ie, nicotine gum, nicotine nasal spray, nicotine inhaler, nicotine lozenge) to cover urges and cravings. We often combine sustained-release (SR) bupropion with nicotine replacement (eg, nicotine patches or short-acting nicotine replacement therapy \\[NRT\\]) if there are no contraindications. Busy clinicians can facilitate decisions on treatment plans by asking patients: “What have you tried before and what would you be interested in trying this time?”\n\n【33】Although combination therapy with multiple NRTs or with a combination of an NRT and bupropion SR is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), available evidence suggests that better smoking abstinence rates are achieved with combination therapy than with monotherapy.\n\n【34】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【35】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【36】A controlled trial of sustained-release bupropion, a nicotine patch, or both for smoking cessation.\n\n【37】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【38】Randomized comparison of a nicotine inhaler and bupropion for smoking cessation and relapse prevention.\n\n【39】### Nicotine Patch\n\n【40】We recommend a graded approach to initial nicotine patch dosing. As a rough guide, the patch dose should be the same or slightly more than the number of cigarettes smoked per day. For example, an initial nicotine patch dose of 35 mg/d (21 mg + 14 mg patches) would be appropriate for patients who smoke 30 cigarettes per day.\n\n【41】Therapy can be altered as needed depending on patients' abstinence and withdrawal symptoms. If patients continue to smoke during the first 2 weeks of patch therapy, the treatment plan must be altered. Patch doses should be increased for patients who experience substantial withdrawal symptoms, such as irritability, anxiety, frustration, loss of concentration, cravings, or frequent use of short-acting nicotine-replacement products. Many patients who have not had success with nicotine patches may have been underdosed and may attribute nicotine withdrawal symptoms to the nicotine patch rather than to inadequate NRT. Patients can be reassured that the patches are not causing adverse effects if symptoms are alleviated with the use of short-acting nicotine-replacement products. The primary adverse effect of too much nicotine is nausea.\n\n【42】Patients should receive 4 weeks of treatment with the initial patch dose; after that, the dose can be “stepped down” by 7 to 14 mg every 2 weeks. Patients are asked to contact us if they feel uncomfortable about stepping down the dose; in such cases, the current dose is maintained and no further stepping down occurs for 1 or 2 weeks. Although nicotine patches are available over the counter, prescriptions are provided to all patients because we do not always know if patients' insurance will cover pharmacologic treatment of tobacco dependence. To save time, we write 1 prescription for both the initial patch dose (enough for 4 weeks of treatment) and for the step-down doses needed every 2 weeks thereafter. The pharmacist can work with patients to determine how much to dispense at any one time to avoid “sticker shock” (ie, unaffordable medication cost) that may discourage medication use and a quit attempt.\n\n【43】The most common adverse effect of nicotine patch therapy is skin irritation at the patch site, which is usually characterized by erythema and pruritus but may be more severe with edema and vesicles. To avoid such irritation, we advise patients to rotate application sites on relatively hairless parts of the body between the neck and waist. If the patches come off because of perspiration, we tell patients to use skin tape to keep them in place. Mild skin reactions can be treated with topical corticosteroids; more severe reactions may require patch discontinuation. On rare occasions, a generalized rash occurs and patches must be discontinued; however, if necessary for adequate symptom relief, use of other nicotine-replacement products can continue, and the dose can be increased. The 21-mg dose can be purchased for about $3.50 per patch for brand names.\n\n【44】### Nicotine Gum\n\n【45】Nicotine gum is available in both 2-mg and 4-mg doses. We rarely use the gum as monotherapy, usually recommending either the 2-mg or 4-mg gum in combination with nicotine patch therapy. We instruct our patients to use the gum to treat cravings and withdrawal symptoms.\n\n【46】Patients should be instructed in the proper use of nicotine gum. They should chew the gum a few times until they feel a mild tingling or peppery taste indicating nicotine release and then “park” the gum between the cheek and gum for several minutes before resuming chewing. Repeated cycles of “chew and park” will allow gradual nicotine absorption and should be continued for approximately 30 minutes per piece of gum. Patients who are “gum chewers” may find it difficult to avoid continuous gum chewing. Patients should avoid carbonated or acidic beverages before and during use because an acidic oral environment binds the nicotine and decreases its absorption across the buccal mucosa.\n\n【47】Although patients are instructed to use as many as 20 pieces of gum per day as needed, most patients use too few pieces. The most common adverse effects are nausea and indigestion, which can be minimized with proper technique. Other reported adverse effects include sore gums. A 4-mg dose of nicotine gum costs approximately $0.40.\n\n【48】### Nicotine Lozenge\n\n【49】Like nicotine gum, the nicotine lozenge delivers nicotine through the oral mucosa and provides active self-dosing in response to cravings. Compared with nicotine gum, the nicotine lozenge is easier to use and has fewer limitations due to oral health issues such as dental work or tempor-omandibular joint syndrome.\n\n【50】The nicotine lozenge is available in 2-mg and 4-mg doses. As monotherapy, the recommended dose for cigarette smokers is based on the time to first cigarette in the morning, which is an indicator for severity of dependence. For patients whose first cigarette is within 30 minutes of waking, the 4-mg strength is indicated, and for smokers whose first cigarette is more than 30 minutes after waking, the 2-mg strength is suggested. The lozenge should be placed between the cheek and gum and not chewed or swallowed whole. Patients should not eat or drink during use or during the 15 minutes before because an acidic oral environment reduces nicotine absorption. In combination with nicotine patch therapy, we usually recommend the 2-mg dose. The most common adverse effects with the nicotine lozenge are headache, diarrhea, heartburn, hiccups, and nausea. Each 4-mg lozenge costs approximately $0.50.\n\n【51】### Nicotine Nasal Spray\n\n【52】The nicotine nasal spray delivers nicotine and reduces withdrawal symptoms more quickly than any of the other nicotine replacement delivery systems.\n\n【53】However, it delivers nicotine less quickly than cigarette smoking, and it does not achieve the high arterial concentrations seen with inhalation of tobacco smoke. We typically recommend the nasal spray to patients who say they smoke to obtain a “quick hit.”\n\n【54】Each spray contains 0.5 mg of nicotine, and 1 dose is 1 spray in each nostril (total of 1 mg). To guide their use of the product, clinicians can advise patients that 1 spray in each nostril can deliver as much nicotine as 1 cigarette. Patients should be instructed to spray it against the lower nasal mucosa and not to sniff it up into the upper nasal passages. We suggest that patients use the nasal spray to manage urges and cravings. Most patients will use 12 to 16 doses per day initially if the spray is being used as monotherapy. We often recommend that patients use the nasal spray in combination with nicotine patch therapy. The most common adverse effects are nasal and eye irritation and a cough that usually subsides in the first week. The nicotine nasal spray costs approximately $5.00 per day for 12 doses.\n\n【55】### Nicotine Inhaler\n\n【56】The nicotine inhaler, available by prescription, delivers vaporized nicotine to the oral mucosa where it is absorbed. Approximately 80 puffs during a 20-minute period are needed to obtain 2 mg of nicotine. Because the inhaler resembles a cigarette rod, we use it with patients for whom the behavioral and tactile aspects of smoking (ie, cigarette handling, cigarette with coffee) are an important trigger. The most frequent adverse effects are mouth or throat irritation and occasional coughing. Each nicotine inhaler cartridge costs approximately $1.00.\n\n【57】NONNICOTINE PHARMACOTHERAPY\n---------------------------\n\n【58】### Bupropion SR\n\n【59】Bupropion SR is a monocyclic antidepressant that inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine but that also has a direct competitive inhibitory effect on the nicotine acetylcholine receptor. Bupropion SR approximately doubles the smoking abstinence rates compared with placebo.\n\n【60】Patients begin taking bupropion SR 1 week before their quit-smoking date, at an initial dose of 150 mg/d for 3 days followed by 150 mg twice daily for approximately 6 to 12 weeks, although it can safely be used longer. Long-term treatment with bupropion SR may reduce or delay relapse to smoking. Bupropion SR can be stopped abruptly and does not require tapering.\n\n【61】We consider bupropion SR to be an “anticraving” medication. It can be used in combination with NRT and with varenicline. Because it may attenuate weight gain among continuously abstinent smokers, it may be particularly useful for smokers concerned about weight gain after cessation of tobacco use.\n\n【62】In studies using the immediate-release form of bupropion, seizures were observed in patients with eating disorders. Although the risk may be lower with the SR form of bupropion, contraindications include a history of seizures, serious head trauma with loss of consciousness, use of medications that lower seizure threshold, or an eating disorder (anorexia nervosa or bulimia). The main adverse effects are insomnia and dry mouth. Cardiovascular and sexual adverse effects are uncommon. Bupropion SR is available in a generic form at a cost of approximately $2.40 per day.\n\n【63】### Varenicline\n\n【64】Varenicline, approved by the FDA in May 2006 for smoking cessation, is a partial nicotine agonist of the α4β2 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The partial agonist activity relieves nicotine withdrawal symptoms and cravings, while the antagonist activity blocks the reinforcing effects of continued cigarette smoking.\n\n【65】The findings of 2 large, randomized, multicenter clinical trials assessing the efficacy of varenicline compared with placebo and bupropion SR for tobacco abstinence have been published.\n\n【66】Varenicline, an α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, vs sustained-release bupropion and placebo for smoking cessation: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【67】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【68】Efficacy of varenicline, an α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, vs placebo or sustained-release bupropion for smoking cessation: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【69】At 3 months, the odds that patients would quit smoking with varenicline were 2-fold higher than with bupropion SR and 4-fold higher than with placebo. Varenicline was also observed to decrease craving, withdrawal symptoms, and smoking satisfaction. Patients who are treated with varenicline for 6 months are more likely to be abstinent at 1 year than those who receive only 3 months of therapy.\n\n【70】Bupropion SR for smoking cessation in smokers with cardiovascular disease: a multicentre, randomised study.\n\n【71】Although no head-to-head comparisons of varenicline and NRT have been conducted, indirect evidence suggests that varenicline is superior to NRT.\n\n【72】The recommended dosing for the first week of treatment with varenicline is 0.5 mg once daily for 3 days and then twice daily for 4 days; the dosage is then “ramped up” to 1 mg twice daily for 11 weeks. In some locations, starter packs are available that provide the appropriate doses for the first month of therapy. Patients should plan to quit on day 8 (target quit day) of therapy, the point at which the target dose of varenicline is reached. We continue varenicline for an additional 3 months beyond the initial 3-month treatment if patients are at a self-identified increased risk of relapse. Varenicline need not be tapered when discontinued. The efficacy and safety of the use of NRT with varenicline have not been established.\n\n【73】The most common adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, which is usually mild to moderate. Vivid dreams have also been reported. Nausea can be minimized by taking the pills with food, which does not decrease bioavailability. The FDA has informed health care professionals that suicidal thoughts, aggressive and erratic behavior, and drowsiness can be associated with the use of varenicline.\n\n【74】Investigations into these associations are ongoing, and clinicians should monitor patients for behavior and mood changes. Varenicline is available at approximately $4.00 per day.\n\n【75】ADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n--------------------\n\n【76】A dose-response relationship exists between counseling time and successful tobacco dependence treatment outcomes.\n\n【77】删除21:<u>Clinical Practice Guideline: Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. US Dept of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service , Rockville, MD 2000</u>\n\n【78】Even brief counseling (2-3 minutes) by a clinician has a measurable effect. Effective counseling enhances motivation and supports commitment to quit smoking and can be provided face to face, via the telephone, or through the Internet.\n\n【79】删除21:<u>Clinical Practice Guideline: Treating Tobacco Use and Dependence. US Dept of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service , Rockville, MD 2000</u>\n\n【80】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【81】For busy clinicians, lengthy counseling is frequently impractical, so knowledge of additional resources is helpful.\n\n【82】Individual and group counseling programs are becoming more widely available. Many hospitals, health departments, and health care facilities have tobacco treatment specialists, and more allied health professionals are becoming certified.\n\n【83】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【84】Certification as a tobacco treatment specialist can provide assurance to the referring clinician that evidence-based treatment is provided.\n\n【85】Tobacco treatment counseling via the telephone is available in every state in the United States and every province in Canada, as well as in many other countries. Currently, the simplest way for clinicians to encourage patients to use a tobacco quitline is to tell them to call 1-800-QUITNOW after leaving the office. Through the National Network of Tobacco Cessation Quitlines, callers will be routed to the tobacco quitline in their state. States provide differing levels of support; patients can find what is available to them when they call. Clinicians can also learn about the state-specific service offerings through the National Quitline Consortium Web site .\n\n【86】The Internet may also be effective in providing support to patients who are trying to quit smoking. A number of Web sites have been developed to support quit attempts, such as the American Legacy website “Become an Ex”  and Quitnet .\n\n【87】CONCLUSION\n----------\n\n【88】Smoking can be effectively addressed within a busy clinical practice using strategies similar to those used to manage other chronic medical conditions. By opening up a relatively brief dialogue, clinicians can engage and reengage patients in tobacco dependence treatment. Nicotine replacement therapies, bupropion SR, varenicline, and combinations of these therapies may motivate smokers to make a quit attempt and relapsed smokers to try again. Busy clinicians can also direct patients to an increasing number of resources, including tobacco treatment specialists, the tobacco quitline, local support groups, and the Internet, to assist them in achieving their goal of smoking cessation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/27 10:25:27", "endTime": "2024/08/27 10:26:29", "cost": 61.772}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:31", "update_time": "2024-08-26 18:26:29", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 18:25:27"}

Patient medical records were abstracted for pertinent clinical data, glucocorticoid use, and final diagnoses. Sensitivities, specificities, predictive values, and likelihood ratios were calculated for the association of the various clinical findings and the presence of a positive biopsy result. Graphic and arithmetic models were constructed to predict positive temporal artery biopsy results.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】During the 10-year interval, 1113 patients had temporal artery biopsy. The results were positive for GCA in 373 patients (33.5%) and negative in 740 (66.5%). Twenty percent of all patients were taking glucocorticoids at the time of biopsy. The presence of jaw claudication had a positive predictive value of 78. Combinations of jaw claudication with new headache, scalp tenderness, and decreased vision had still higher values. Positive likelihood ratios in patients with these combinations and in those with diplopia were greater than 3. A normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate in patients not taking corticosteroids provided a high negative likelihood ratio of 40. An arithmetic equation provided the probability of a positive biopsy result on a continuous scale using 6 variables identified by logistic regression. Patients with a greater than 80% chance of a positive biopsy result and those with less than a 10% chance were identified.\n\n【6】### Conclusion\n\n【7】Positive predictive values, likelihood ratios, and an arithmetic formula identify patients who have an increased or decreased chance of a positive temporal artery biopsy result. Use of these methods to determine early initiation of glucocorticoid therapy before temporal artery biopsy or deferral until after biopsy may help reduce both vascular complications of GCA and adverse effects of corticosteroids.\n\n【8】#### Abbreviations:\n\n【9】ESR ( erythrocyte sedimentation rate ), GCA ( giant cell arteritis ), LR ( likelihood ratio ), NPV ( negative predictive value ), PPV ( positive predictive value )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:28:53", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:29:02", "cost": 9.28}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:31", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:29:01", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:28:52"}

The patients were followed up for a maximum of 9.1 years (median, 3.7 years), and survival in ischemic and nonischemic patients was determined.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Median age was 69 years, and median LVEF was 31%. Of the 960 patients, 532 (55.4%) had ischemic HF etiology, and most received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (846; 88.1%) and β-blockers (776; 80.8%).

This article focuses on ways physicians can develop more useful relationships among these groups. We used a grounded theory approach to conduct 71 interviews from August 12, 2004, to December 27, 2005, with 25 practicing physicians in large and small groups, urban and rural areas, private and academic settings, and primary care and specialty practices; 33 hospital administrators, medical association executives, health insurance medical officers, and health policy analysts; and 13 senior executives of large and small companies. The study identifies 2 approaches to the structuring of ambulatory care that can lead to improved health care outcomes and value. In the first approach, direct contracting between physicians and employers transfers tasks previously performed by insurers to employers or other intermediaries who may be able to provide better service or lower cost. In the second approach, insurermediated relationships between physicians and employers are restructured, particularly in ways that improve information flow. Such relationships may strengthen physicians' ability to provide quality services while enabling patients to make more informed decisions about physician selection, treatments, and spending. We believe that broader use of these approaches may improve the quality and efficiency of ambulatory care for the large proportion of the population that has work-related health insurance. Although the findings are promising, our intent is not to claim broad external validity but rather to encourage greater experience with these approaches and more formal studies of their effectiveness.\n\n【1】**A** lthough physicians work in the microsystems at the cutting edge of ambulatory care, employers and insurers play key roles in the mesosystems and macrosystems that provide the broader context for that care.\n\n【2】Employers pay for most private health care in the United States,\n\n【3】and insurers are the intermediaries between employers and physicians.

In an earlier phase,\n\n【40】we focused on how employers can manage employee wellness and health care costs more proactively. In this phase, we have explored the collaborative actions that physicians can take.\n\n【41】METHODS\n-------\n\n【42】Our methods were designed to generate hypotheses about the ways physicians, employers, and insurers can restructure their relationships to improve the delivery of ambulatory care. We used grounded theory, an approach developed in sociological research in which the theory emerges from extensive study of the data and is then illustrated by representative examples of the data.\n\n【43】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【44】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【45】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【46】The researcher does not have a preconceived theoretical framework. Rather, the process begins with an open investigation of the problem area. Detailed notes are taken, coded, and analyzed. The new theory emerges as the data are compared with existing theory. The study sample is then expanded to include other examples that may indicate the boundaries of the theory. The data collection-analysis-theory development cycle continues iteratively until further searching nolonger disconfirms the emerging theory. In our case, the approach identified ways health outcomes and value can be improved by replacing the often adversarial relationship among physicians, employers, and insurers with a cooperative relationship.\n\n【47】### Project Design\n\n【48】The study included 71 interviews conducted from August 12, 2004, to December 27, 2005. Our respondents included 25 practicing physicians in large and small groups, urban and rural areas, private and academic settings, and primarycare and specialty practices. Another 33 respondents, two thirds of whom were physicians, included hospital administrators, medical association executives, health insurance medical officers, and health policy analysts. Employer interviews were conducted with 13 senior executives of large and small companies.\n\n【49】### Data Collection and Interpretation\n\n【50】We began by identifying participants (approximately one quarter of the total) who we believed would be knowledgeable about both clinical practice and business and would help us identify novel approaches to collaboration. The rest of the sample was then selected using the snowball sampling method in which interview participants referred us to others, an appropriate technique when the goal is hypothesis generation.\n\n【51】We conducted semistructured interviews of participants by telephone. Typically, 2 of the authors (L.L.B. A.M.M.) interviewed each participant for approximately 30 minutes, with one taking detailed notes. Interviewees frequently sent additional information as a follow-up to the interview.\n\n【52】Our first 17 interviews were with clinicians. Interview questions focused on the challenges physicians face in clinical practice and ways business might be able to help. We analyzed the interview transcripts, looking for novel ideas about how physicians could work with business in ways that could improve patient health, system efficiency, and financial performance. We synthesized the emerging themes into a conceptual model of physician partnerships with employers and insurers. We refined the model during a second wave of interviews with 33 respondents, 28 of whom were physicians. Participants identified strengths and weaknesses of the draft model and proposed changes. Finally, we validated the feasibility of the revised model in a series of interviews with 21 business and insurance executives who could potentially partner with clinicians. We continued interviewing participants in each phase of the study until the marginal value of additional interviews was minimal.\n\n【53】RESULTS\n-------\n\n【54】The need for change was frequently and forcefully expressed by many respondents. An infectious disease specialist noted, “The biggest pressure I have as a doctor is to deal with insurance to get paid for what we do. Seeing patients is a piece of cake.” The director of benefits of a medium-sized employer said, “I wouldn't consider us partners with our insurer. Every year we have the battle of premiums and administrative fees. It's not much of a partnership.” \n\n【55】TABLE 2 Illustrative Informant Statements\n\n| **The Need for Change**“There are differing reimbursement rules among insurers. That is an issue. I think it is a nightmare for physicians.”_—Chief medical officer of a health insurer_“The amount of resources we dedicate to getting paid is embarrassing. To the extent that business as the payer can be empathetic may create interesting solutions.”_—Hospital chief executive_“The growing image of health insurers is that they will do everything in their power to deny claims. Employers are fighting costs. Employees are angry with costs. Physicians feel no one appreciates them. It's a dysfunctional family.”_—Chairman of a medium-sized employer_“The only entity that truly cares about health care costs is the employer.”_—Internist_“As the CFO \\[chief financial officer\\] of a privately held company, nothing bothers me more than how I am going to provide health care for my employees for the next 10 years.”_—Chief financial officer of a medium-sized employer_“You will frequently hear physicians rant and rave about those lousy insurance companies and if you then ask them when they last actually sat down with someone from the insurance company to discuss specific issues, concerns, or strategies, their response is frequently, ‘Well, I've never actually done that.’”_—Internist_“Don't trash me, the employer. I, the employer, am not the enemy. I want what you want: healthy people. Why argue with the people who are employing half the population? Why not work with us?”_—Chief medical officer of a large employer_ |\n| --- |\n| **Promise of Direct Contracting Between Physicians and Employers**“I believe solutions to this dilemma of spiraling costs will be found at the community level, not at the federal level.”_—Surgeon and chief medical officer of a multispecialty clinic_“I could get excited about going into a workplace and talking to people about taking responsibility for their own health, how to deal with stress effectively, how to eat better. I see people who have stress issues and complain about their workplace environment.”_—Family physician_“The thing that appeals to me the most is the direct pay model because I think it has a better potential to work. The key is to understand employees and to really identify what they want. The secret to improving their participation is education _and_ incentives. Incentivize employees to do the things that are beneficial to their long-term health. And the employer is in a position to do that.”_—Internist and medical director of a large group practice_“A company just came into our area adding 400 new employees. This is a prime opportunity for a large multispecialty practice to reach out and offer high-risk disease management, safety and injury management with aggressive care of injuries such that employees feel good about the care. This could be packaged as a recruiting tool for workers. For the physician it provides a more stable base income.”_—Registered nurse and hospital system quality improvement executive_“We've studied how you put a complete EMR \\[electronic medical record\\] and decision- support system in a doctor's office. The doctor does the “I” of the ROI \\[return on investment\\] and the payer gets the “R.” EMRs would reduce the amount payers fund by 15%. So why not have employers pay for EMRs in return for gain sharing?”_—Chief information officer of a hospital system_“I like the idea of a direct pay model. My staff could be half the size if we didn't have to work so hard to get reimbursed by insurance companies.”_—Otolaryngologist_“I like getting rid of the middleman. I would love to be able to have the discussion with business to tell them the stupid things we are dealing with.”_—Family physician_“Several of my patients wanted me to be their company physician. One particular patient asked me 3 times before I agreed to look into it. Now \\[as a physician practicing at a company clinic\\], I get dependable reimbursement for my time; convenience and cost-savings for my patients, who are generally more appreciative of my time and services than even the patients at my own practice; and new referrals by the patients into my nursing home and office practice.”_—Family physician with a 1½-day per week direct contracting arrangement_“It breaks my heart that direct contracting is so rare. Couple this with evidence-based care and we could solve this mess. I think the issue is it's time and energy intensive. Most employers tell me they are in the cereal business or the widget business, not the medical business. I say, ‘Of course you're in the medical business. You're spending as much on medical care as you earn in profits.’”_—Physician and chief medical officer of an employer that uses direct contracting_ |\n| **Promise of Insurer-Mediated Relationships Between Physicians and Employers**“Pay physicians to talk to patients. The rise in alternative medicine is because each of its branches involves touching people and connecting with them. If you come back to a high-touch system, you address the critical issues in people's lives such as stress, diet, exercise, smoking and drinking.”_—Physician and chief medical officer of a health insurer_“Your model is our model. We grew our hospital system just to get critical mass with insurers. We got big enough so they can't ignore us. We created a dialogue. We told them what we wanted and asked what they wanted.”_—Physician and chief executive of a rural hospital system and physician group_“Our partnership with the insurer is truly a collaborative effort. We meet weekly. We developed a model to rank things, determine how we’ll get paid and what the pot of money will be. We have set aside to an impressive degree all the old crap.”_—Physician and chief executive of a large oncology practice_“We have learned that if you don't have a relationship and if you don't work collaboratively on projects you lose communication. Administrative hassles and claims are resolved more easily when there is a relationship in place.The whole negotiation goes easier because you start from a place of mutual understanding.”_—Physician and medical director of a health insurer_“Insurance companies don't do a good job of cementing relationships with employers. They could provide meaningful reports—reports showing where the dollars are being spent, benchmarking expenses compared to similar employers, looking at the overall health of a firm's employees, and assessing plan design in terms of the company's objectives.”_—Chief executive officer of an independent physicians' association_“Our members get services from people we don't employ. How do you make sure your customers get excellent service if you don't directly control it? We've concluded that partnering is more effective than hitting people over the head with a stick.”_—Physician and vice-president of a health insurer_“We recognize that medicine in the future will require us to measure performance and improve on it, rather than say we do a pretty good job and leave it there.”_—Physician and associate medical director of a large multispecialty practice_ |\n| **Words of Caution**“Change happens when the pain of the status quo exceeds the perceived pain of change and we're not at that point yet. Health plans are doing well.”_—Manager of health care programming for a large employer_“In talking to employers, I've found that, while they may be in pain, it is very difficult to get them to do anything around health care other than tweaking the co-pay. The CEO \\[chief executive officer\\] may send you to the VP \\[vice president\\] of human resources who tends not to be a change agent. It's difficult to find the right people to listen.”_—Internist interested in doing direct contracting_“For direct contracting, you need a special company with a special vision, a company that has run out of other options.”_—Principal of an employee benefits consulting firm specializing in direct contracting_“One of the great dilemmas we have is that people want unlimited access. In the direct pay model, you will highly limit choice. I don't think patients are going to buy it. Physicians will like the steady income stream from a long-term contract with an employer. It will simplify their lives. What's in it for the employee? Financial incentives? A vetted physician group?”_—Physician and chief medical officer of a health insurer_“I'm still leery of whether the direct model can work. You need to have the right doctors in the direct network. People are constantly disappointed to go through HMO \\[health maintenance organization\\] and PPO \\[preferred provider organization\\] lists and find that their doctors are not on the list of providers.”_—Owner of a medium-sized employer_“Companies considering direct contracting need to have a 3-year time horizon. The significant savings come in years 2 and 3. The focus on prevention often does not show a material return for 2 years.”_—Principal of consulting firm that develops direct contracting relationships_“The physician needs to have enough of the business's employees in the patient group to justify the internal administrative hurdles involved in setting up a payment system to a captive medical group.”_—Physician and corporate medical director of a large employer_“Adoption of EHR \\[electronic health record\\] and decision-support tools—the whole IT \\[information technology\\] piece— shouldn't be another prong in a multiprong paradigm, but should really be the central part of the model, the unifying part. IT is the cohesive bond. If that's not fixed it's silly to talk about these models.”_—Physician and senior executive of a health insurer_ |\n\n【57】Two broad opportunities for physicians to establish more productive partnerships emerged from the data . The first is for physicians to bypass insurers and contract directly with employers to provide health care services to employees and dependents. The second is for physicians to establish more productive and extensive relationships with insurers that, in turn, can strengthen insurers' relationships with employers.\n\n【58】### Direct Contracting Between Physicians and Employers\n\n【59】Direct contracting is a promising model for improved physician-employer relationships . The medical director of a large employer that uses direct contracting said, “Medical groups loved the idea of direct contracting with us. No one turned us down. They had never before had a chance to talk to employers. The chance to work directly with an employer was appealing. We had them over and described where we were trying to go. We asked them to participate when we developed guidelines. We sent our drafts over for comment. We went out of our way to pay promptly.”\n\n【60】FIGURE 2 Direct contracting relationship between physician and employer. EHR = electronic health record.\n\n【61】In a direct contracting relationship, the physician collaborates with an employer to provide health services to employees and dependents, either on company premises or at the physician's office. We found that large medical groups, small groups, and solo practitioners were participating in direct contracting relationships. Employers appeared to favor physicians with board certification, an uncluttered history of malpractice litigation and complaints, and the ability to build interpersonal relationships with patients. Participating employers are typically self-insured firms with more than 200 employees, rather than smaller firms that purchase health coverage through an insurer.\n\n【62】Direct contracting relationships often consist initially of agreements between employers and primary care physicians; specialist relationships may be added later. Compensation is typically fee for service, and employers commit to prompt reimbursement. Physicians usually work with the employer's medical director to establish clinical guidelines and patient satisfaction goals. Agreements typically stipulate that the physician is responsible for directing care and provide for noninterference by the employer. Figure 2 lists common responsibilities of employees and physicians.\n\n【63】Employees and their dependents typically have a financial incentive to use company-contracted physicians but have the flexibility to seek care elsewhere. In some firms, employees choose on a visit-by-visit basis; in others, employees choose annually among health plans, with one option being lower-cost company-contracted physicians.\n\n【64】Direct contracting relationships have been initiated by physicians and by employers. Occasionally, the employer's human resources staff directly negotiates the contracts. Frequently, intermediaries facilitate the administrative contacts between the physician and employer, performing functions traditionally handled by insurers. For example, anintermediary may develop the physician network by negotiating terms with participating physicians. Other intermediaries may administer benefits and claims and review utilization. These intermediaries do not assume risk or interpose clinical or fiscal policies. They are strictly administrative, which makes them fundamentally different from insurers.\n\n【65】The experience of Perdue Farms and physicians in rural Maryland and nearby states is illustrative. Perdue established direct contracting relationships with health care professionals in small and large practices to provide onsite and offsite care for Perdue's 45,000 employees and dependents. Perdue built onsite primary and specialty care clinics at its chicken processing plants. Employees and dependents receive longitudinal care for acute and chronic disease as well as preventive services. Employees are charged $10 per visit, payable through payroll deduction. Employees complete health risk appraisals and receive personalized plans for health. Contracted physicians are supported by a single clinical laboratory. Primary care often assumes a central role in direct contracting, which is the case at Perdue. Since Perdue began contracting with physicians, primary care has increased from 6% of Perdue's physician spending to 30%. At their discretion, primary care physicians provide referrals to specialists.\n\n【66】Perdue reports an average annual health care inflation rate of 0.7% for 2002 to 2005, well below national trends.\n\n【67】Health care costs per employee, including costs of administering the plan, are approximately half the national average. Perdue attributes the savings to the direct contracting relationships that emphasize prevention and appropriate treatment of chronic conditions and reduce emergency department visits for employees with minor illnesses. Also, the onsite clinics are structured to encourage the use of evidence-based medicine and generic drugs.\n\n【68】Two of the programs we studied, the Perdue Farms direct contracting program and a similar program at Quad Graphics in Wisconsin, are fairly elaborate, but we also uncovered simpler direct contracting models. CareHere, a company in Nashville, Tenn, connects physicians with smaller employers who want to establish onsite primary care clinics at worksites with 100 or more employees. CareHere recruits physicians from the employer's health plan network, preferring physicians already popular with employees. Physicians we interviewed emphasized the dependable reimbursement, reduced administrative burden, and opportunity for referrals to their office practices. They perceived themselves as patient coaches rather than distrusted gatekeepers.\n\n【69】A board-certified family physician described his weekly 12 hours in an onsite clinic for county employees as, “A chance to get back to what medicine is all about. I spend my time taking care of patients—not filling out paperwork.” Employers in the CareHere system are experiencing health care cost trends of 3%, approximately a third of national averages.\n\n【70】Drug costs are typically 7.5% lower in the first year and 15% lower in the second year of the direct contracting relationship.\n\n【71】### Insurer-Mediated Relationships Between Physicians and Employers\n\n【72】In this model, insurers shift their missions from minimizing claims costs to improving health care value . The insurer-mediated model reassesses 2 sets of relationships: those between employers and insurers\n\n【73】and those between physicians and insurers, which we focus on herein. Our informants told us that participants in a fully evolved physician-insurer relationship will need to undertake most of the actions described on the left side of Figure 3 .\n\n【74】FIGURE 3 Insurer-mediated relationships between physicians and employers. EHR = electronic health record.\n\n【75】During our investigations, we found examples in which physicians and insurers were able to improve quality and finances through collaboration. To illustrate, Premera Blue Cross in Washington State asked physicians to codevelop a quality scorecard, rather than imposing a reporting system. The initiative, which covered 13 clinics and 300,000 members in 2005, began in 2001 when Premera invited 6 large multispecialty medical groups to identify key quality and satisfaction indicators. A clinic medical director observed, “Premera was smart to let us build the scorecard. We can't use the ‘they did this to us’ excuse. And we set the bar higher than Premera might have.” Contracts with some participating clinics are structured to provide financial rewards for improvements in performance over prior year results.\n\n【76】Such efforts were associated with documented improvement in the delivery of recommended care, particularly for low-scoring measures. For example, early results show substantial improvement among the 1200 diabetic patients with Premera health coverage seen at participating clinics: from 2003 to 2004, hemoglobin A <sub>1c </sub> level of less than 7% improved from 27.4% to 51.3% of patients; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of less than 100 mg/dL improved from 26.7% to 41.6% of patients; and systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg improved from 25.9% to 38.6% of patients.\n\n【77】The scorecard also gives physicians an early warning of undesired trends. For example, appropriate use of antibiotics for acute bronchitis, another low-scoring measure, improved 37.7% in 2003 and then declined 10.5% in 2004. Participating medical groups and Premera discussed reasons for the retrenchment (some physicians noted that the decline paralleled reduced media attention to the appropriate use of antibiotics\n\n【78】) and were then able to pay greater attention to appropriate practices. Premera is also developing desktop tools that allow physicians to see their monthly performance along with a list of their patients who are not receiving recommended care or not filling prescriptions, which enables physicians to follow up.\n\n【79】Insurers can facilitate cooperation among medical groups. A physician participating in Premera's quality scorecard program commented, “Doctors are competitive. If another clinic can do well at making sure congestive heart patients are on ACE \\[angiotensin-converting enzyme\\] inhibitors, then we can, too. There's an overwhelming willingness among the clinics to share their expertise so we can all get better.” Cancer Care Northwest, an inte-grated multispecialty oncology practice in Spokane, Wash, created a program with Premera designed to improve quality, reduce waste, and improve practice finances by adopting evidence-based clinical pathways. It is now measuring adherence to the pathways, for example, tracking the percentage of breast cancer patients with sentinel lymph node sampling or appropriate axillary dissections. With Premera's encouragement, Cancer Care Northwest reached out to other local medical groups, and Spokane-area pulmonologists, surgeons, and medical and radiation oncologists are working together to develop joint clinical pathways for evaluating and treating lung cancer. The oncology group's chief executive observed, “I've been interested in quality for years but I didn't have the infrastructure or the time. In the ideal world, we should just do it, but in the real world, we needed a partner who could structure payment programs to provide appropriate incentives.”\n\n【80】Insurer-physician collaborations require an appreciation of the strengths and limitations of each partner. Premera tailored a quality recognition program for small office practices, which typically lack the computer and staff infrastructure for quality reporting. The insurer reviews claims histories to recognize physicians who consistently follow national guidelines in, for example, cancer screenings or appropriate use of antibiotics.\n\n【81】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【82】Using business parlance, physicians, health insurers, and employers form the core of a distribution channel, defined as the set of interdependent organizations involved in the process of making a good or service available to the end user. However, when distribution channel relationships are dysfunctional, inefficiencies develop, and dissatisfaction is more likely.\n\n【83】In health care, abundant evidence has shown that the current distribution channel does not operate optimally. Patients report difficulty in obtaining access to care and to physician-level quality and price information. Physicians complain that claims processing, referrals, and authorizations are overly burdensome. Employers believe costs are too high, and physicians believe reimbursements are too low.\n\n【84】From our interview data, we developed a conceptual model  with 2 approaches for improving the delivery of outpatient medical care: direct contracting between physicians and employers  and restructured relationships between insurers and employers and between insurers and physicians . Our model should be considered a prospective model that conveys what could be. Although both approaches are now being used successfully, they have yet to spread widely. Measuring the extent and sustainability of their potential benefits requires more time and much more research. We hope that presenting these ideas at this early stage will stimulate that research while encouraging physicians, employers, and insurers who are dissatisfied with the status quo to consider these options.\n\n【85】Our findings suggest that direct contracting between physicians and employers has the potential to offer more appropriate reimbursement to physicians, reimbursement that rewards adherence to evidence-based medicine and quality results and ultimately may lead to less costly health care. Participants cited improved access to primary care, more consistent care for chronic diseases, an emphasis on preventive health and early detection of disease, and lower unnecessary emergency department use among the salient benefits of direct contracting. The assessment is consistent with the emerging literature that associates improved access to primary care with reduced illness and disease, rationalized access to specialty care, reduced socioeconomic and geographic disparity, reduced emergency department use, and lower costs.\n\n【86】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【87】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【88】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【89】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【90】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【91】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【92】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【93】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【94】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【95】Resolving the gatekeeper conundrum: what patients value in primary care and referrals to specialists.\n\n【96】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【97】Direct contracting participants also suggested practice innovation may be sparked by the opportunity for physicians and employers to communicate directly. Physicians may be able to reduce staff expenses for billing and collection.\n\n【98】The direct contracting model best fits self-insured employers with 200 or more employees who assume the financial risk of health care costs and use third-party administrators to process benefits and claims. Approximately 50% of all US employees are enrolled in self-insured companies' plans.\n\n【99】Because these employers retain financial responsibility for health care costs, there is no need to carve out the direct contracting relationship for actuarial calculations. The concept holds less financial appeal for smaller, fully insured employers, who would absorb the cost of direct contracting services in addition to health insurance premiums.\n\n【100】Direct contracting should work best in organizations that have earned the trust of employees. Employees need assurance of a firewall between the physician and the company's operating management, given the highly personal nature of health care and the potential for divided loyalties of physicians who work directly for their employer. Indeed, some staff physicians hired by large companies to offer onsite medical care and manage workers' compensation programs report pressure to minimize corporate expenses rather than provide high-quality care.\n\n【101】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【102】The relationship between physician and employer cannot dominate the physician's ethical and legal duty to the patient and achieve sustainable success.\n\n【103】We restrict the application of our direct contracting model to physicians and employers who are both committed to putting the patient first. Nonetheless, because the potential for divided loyalties exists, we favor direct contracting models in which patients retain the choice between company-contracted physicians and other physicians.\n\n【104】Although the direct contracting model is promising in certain situations, we believe insurers will continue to mediate most relationships between physicians and employers. Insurers underwrite risk, a critical requirement of smaller employers. Moreover, many employers and physicians will be reluctant to invest the time required to establish direct contracting relationships. In addition, some employees may prefer access to noncontracted physicians or need such access when they require highly specialized care or are traveling.\n\n【105】Our findings suggest that the health care system will be better served by physician-insurer interactions characterized by open communications and cooperation, thus facilitating the pooling of resources to better understand and care for patients. Although insurers will continue to manage risk, they can add value by focusing less on managing costs and more on managing information in ways that help physicians, patients, and employers make better decisions about care. Insurers can help employers reward innovative physicians who achieve superior clinical outcomes, adopt proven medical practices, and satisfy patients. We believe the distrust that physicians, employers, and patients harbor for insurers\n\n【106】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【107】删除19:<u><sup>,</sup></u>\n\n【108】could help motivate these changes. Insurers hold substantial power in the current structure. Organizational research suggests that industries are likely to lose social power if it is misused; for example, government regulation may restrict the options of offending parties.\n\n【109】Finally, we note that many insurers we interviewed espouse the values articulated in our model, but few physicians or employers had seen evidence of insurers' intentions. This finding further suggests to us the value of physicians reaching out to insurers.\n\n【110】Our study has several limitations. One is the relatively small number of informants. The hypothesis-generating rather than hypothesis-testing study purpose mitigates this limitation to a degree. Moreover, we continued interviewing participants in each phase of the study until the marginal value of additional interviews was minimal. Another limitation is that the resulting models do not encompass the large number of patients without employer-sponsored health insurance. With employer-sponsored health insurance covering only 63% of the population,\n\n【111】the approaches discussed herein can make important contributions but are not comprehensive solutions. Most importantly, our study's research design can identify interesting and promising ideas, but it cannot provide the information needed to decide with confidence the generalizability or the sustained merit of the ideas.\n\n【112】Third-party payers, driven largely by commercial and political pressures, are so deeply entrenched in the US health care system that their role in the current dysfunctional delivery system seems somehow natural or inevitable. However, the results of this study suggest that it is possible to shift the relationships among physicians, insurers, and employers to create a more efficient and effective ambulatory care delivery system . Physicians, especially those in smaller practices and in primary care, generally have less bargaining power than insurers or large employers in the current system.\n\n【113】The 2 approaches discussed in this article can help elevate physicians' relative influence. A 2-physician practice that takes care of numerous employees in an organization will certainly have influence with that employer. Physicians who can document superior health outcomes and reduced waste have a better opportunity to influence an insurer. Table 4 indicates some initial steps physicians can take to develop these relationships. An argument can even be made that physicians are uniquely equipped to catalyze the development of better medical care delivery systems. As one of our respondents stated, Physicians must lead change in health care. They better understand the health care system and better understand what constitutes value. They are better able to lead other physicians. They understand patients' needs. And they understand physicians' fiduciary responsibility to patients as well as responsibility to the population. Ultimately, this is all about changing culture and physicians can best do that.\n\n【114】TABLE 3 Uncommon Scenario: Physicians, Insurers, and Employers as Partners\n\n| **Physicians, insurers, and employers engaged in progressive partnerships will be more likely to adopt goals and behaviors related to the larger goals of improved health care outcomes and efficiency …** | **Physicians, insurers, and employers engaged in progressive partnerships will be more likely to adopt goals and behaviors related to the larger goals of improved health care outcomes and efficiency …** | **Physicians, insurers, and employers engaged in progressive partnerships will be more likely to adopt goals and behaviors related to the larger goals of improved health care outcomes and efficiency …** |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Physicians will tend to push to** | **Insurers will tend to push to** | **Employers will tend to push to** |\n| Provide evidence-based careImprove practice productivityEarn an attractive compensation | Improve the health of the entire insured groupAssure quality of services paid forMinimize inappropriate claims payoutsAchieve an attractive profit | Observe improved efficiency, effectiveness, and safety of health care services for employees and dependentsStabilize health care cost increases |\n| **The partners align incentives to encourage coordinated strategies …** | **The partners align incentives to encourage coordinated strategies …** | **The partners align incentives to encourage coordinated strategies …** |\n| **Physicians are more likely to**Invest in electronic health recordsInvest in evidence-based decision-support systemsBe transparent with outcomes and cost informationInvest more in patient education and counselingOffer extended hours and nonvisit access | **Insurers are more likely to**Track physician performance initially measuring adherence to preferred processes and eventually measuring outcomesRecognize high-performing physicians with meaningful, timely rewardsDisseminate physician outcome and cost information to employers and patientsCoach patients who are evaluating treatment alternatives | **Employers are more likely to**Encourage and educate employees to make thoughtful health care decisionsOffer personal health assessments and identify appropriate interventionsIntegrate wellness into the company cultureEmphasize preventionDemand and reward quality from health care physicians |\n| **As a result, the health care system is strengthened and channel members are rewarded for strong performance …** | **As a result, the health care system is strengthened and channel members are rewarded for strong performance …** | **As a result, the health care system is strengthened and channel members are rewarded for strong performance …** |\n| **Physicians are more likely to achieve**Safer, more effective, patient-centered care delivered in a timely, efficient, and equitable manner | **Insurers are more likely to achieve**Better decision making by patientsContinuous improvement among physiciansImproved reputations | **Employers are more likely to achieve**Reduced incidence of lifestyle diseasesReduced regional variation in careImproved employee productivity and job satisfaction |\n\n【116】TABLE 4 Getting Started in Building Partnerships With Insurers and Employers\n\n| **All relationships start with communication.

Diffuse and strong expression of GS within hepatic adenomas (in contrast to the adjacent normal hepatic parenchyma) is a feature of adenomas with activating β-catenin gene mutations.

The populations at risk for head and neck cancers are those who have a long-standing history of smoking and alcohol use. More recently, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer in younger populations has been increasing and is associated with exposure to the human papillomavirus. This subset of patients appears to have a better overall prognosis and to respond better to treatment. This review is limited to head and neck cancers of squamous cell histology, which constitute more than 90% of head and neck cancers. Because treatment of head and neck cancers is complex and involves multiple modalities, a multidisciplinary approach is needed. This review focuses on the goal of organ preservation and postoperative treatment of high-risk patients with the concurrent use of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. This review also highlights recent advances in treatment using molecularly targeted therapies, specifically the role of inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor in locally advanced and recurrent/metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.

Data for 3 primary and 2 secondary outcomes were extracted by 2 investigators.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Eight RCTs were included in the analysis. Comparable or better outcomes were observed with the ciprofloxacin/β-lactam combination vs an aminoglycoside/β-lactam combination: clinical cure without modification of the initial regimen (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 1.32; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.00–1.74; _P_ \\=.05), clinical cure in the subset of patients with documented infections (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.05–2.31; _P_ \\=.03), all-cause mortality (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.54–1.35; _P_ \\=.49), withdrawal of the study drugs due to toxicity (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.57–1.32; _P_ \\=.51), and nephrotoxicity (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.16–0.59; _P_ <.001). The ciprofloxacin/β-lactam combination was also associated with better clinical cure compared to the aminoglycoside/β-lactam combination in the subset of RCTs with non-low-risk patients (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.01–1.88; _P_ \\=.04), as well as in the subset of studies that included the same β-lactam in both treatment arms (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.06–2.05; _P_ \\=.02).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】The combination of ciprofloxacin with a β-lactam antibiotic should be considered an important therapeutic option in hospitalized febrile neutropenic patients who have not received a quinolone for prevention of infections and in settings in which quinolone resistance is not common.\n\n【8】#### Key words:\n\n【9】AGIHO-DGHO ( Infectious Diseases Working Party of the German Society of Hematology and Oncology ), CI ( confidence interval ), IDSA ( Infectious Diseases Society of America ), OR ( odds ratio ), RCT ( randomized controlled trial )", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/26 16:25:42", "endTime": "2024/08/26 16:26:07", "cost": 25.375}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-26 00:06:30", "update_time": "2024-08-26 00:26:07", "grab_time": "2024-08-26 00:25:41"}
