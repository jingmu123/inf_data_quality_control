In their comparison of premortem diagnoses with autopsy findings, the authors conclude that 16% of autopsies revealed missed major diagnoses (Goldman class I), including fungal infection, cardiac tamponade, abdominal hemorrhage, and myocardial infarction. The present study is distinguished by the facts that (1) the authors' institution has a high autopsy rate (93%); (2) the study includes well-characterized clinicalautopsy correlations; and (3) the study concludes with the actual implementation of a policy change in their institution's MICU.\n\n【7】For all these reasons, a study such as this will be the envy of many autopsy pathologists in North America and Europe. The authors were fortunate to work in an environment where autopsies are performed by default, denied only when the family promptly objects. Elsewhere there has been a long, steady decline in autopsy rates, attributable to a number of factors, including (1) a false belief that everything important is known about the patient before death; (2) an equally false belief that autopsy findings contribute no understanding of pathophysiologic events in the patient; (3) an increasingly cumbersome physical process of performing autopsies, under so-called universal precautions, due to an increased risk of infectious diseases such as hepatitis and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; (4) a change in the financial arrangements for performing autopsies over the past decade, making them burdensome and unrewarding for practicing pathologists; (5) a deterioration in the intellectual status of autopsy pathology in research and education in favor of more high-technology investigations in pathology; and (6) the inability to share autopsy findings outside the originating institution. The immediate result is that few medical centers can assemble enough autopsy cases or, rather, enough autopsy cases with a desired combination of clinicopathologic features to undertake meaningful autopsy investigations.\n\n【8】There are numerous other published studies of errors discovered at autopsy, many cited in this article's comprehensive reference list, to the point that one might draw the regrettable conclusion that the chief intellectual occupation of pathologists is to expose the misbehavior of our clinical colleagues. In a recent pathology study, unfortunately not that atypical, the authors state that a diagnosis in one of the study cases is currently in Iitigation.\n\n【9】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【10】*   Weinstein M\n*   Greenspan DL\n*   Epstein JI\n\n【11】Diagnoses rendered on prostate needle biopsy in community hospitals.\n\n【12】_Prostate._ 1998; 35 : 50-55\n\n【13】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (18)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【14】Not only is this public exposure self-defeating in terms of securing the cooperation of our clinical colleagues in obtaining autopsy permissions, but it does not generally serve to advance the practice of medicine.

During the resection, continuous examinations by a neurologist and speech pathologist were performed. The goal of surgery was to resect the maximum neurologically permissible tumor volume defined on preoperative T2 imaging. Tumor resection was stopped at the onset of neurologic dysfunction. Novel segmentation software was used to measure tumor cytoreduction based on pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging. All patients underwent 3-month postoperative neurologic examinations to determine functional outcomes.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】The cortical and subcortical white matter tracts at risk for injury were the left frontal operculum in 15 patients, the central lobule in 38, the insula in 11, and the left angular gyrus in 1. Thirty-four (52%) had a greater than 90% reduction in T2 signal postoperatively. In 26 patients thought to have low-grade tumors based on preoperative imaging, 12 proved to have grade 3 gliomas. Forty-eight patients (74%) developed intraoperative deficits; 34 (71%) recovered to a modified Rankin grade of 0 or 1 at 3 months postoperatively, 11 (23%) achieved a modified Rankin grade of 2, and 3 patients (6%) achieved a modified Rankin grade of 3 or 4 at 3-month follow-up. There was no operative mortality; 17 patients (26%) died from tumor progression during the follow-up period.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】Combining frameless computer-guided stereotaxis with cortical stimulation and repetitive neurologic and language assessments facilitates tumor resection in functioning brain regions. Resecting tumor until the onset of neurologic deficits allows for a good functional recovery. Imaging software can objectively and accurately measure preoperative and postoperative tumor volumes.\n\n【8】CT ( computed tomography ), FOV ( field of view ), IV ( intravenous ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging )\n\n【9】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】One-time access price info\n\n【13】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】### Subscribe:\n\n【15】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】Already a print subscriber?

(Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic opioid agonist-antagonist drug with adverse effects shared with other opioids. It is sometimes used to treat opioid addiction, much as methadone is used.) The Hamza and Bryson article sheds light on some of the problems associated with this practice and with the state monitoring systems (eg, physician health programs \\[PHPs\\]) that are in place to secure recovery from addiction and protect the public. Our colleagues in addiction medicine have engaged in bipartisan clinical decision making related to the use of buprenorphine. There are zealots on both sides: some advocate for everyone with opioid dependence to have maintenance buprenorphine treatment, whereas others believe that no one should use it. Without scientific inquiry and data, we lack predictors to help determine the appropriate use of this treatment for our patients. Opioid-dependent HCPs are a distinct, singular group, but the literature reviewed by Hamza and Bryson and their documentation of state policies for the use of this treatment help us to understand buprenorphine's shortcomings in this population as well as limitations of the state monitoring systems, such as PHPs. This article exposes a buprenorphine practice that is relatively unsupported by literature and does not account for risks associated with cognitive deficits. The article also reveals how the lack of national standards for decision making on the timing of HCPs' return to work promotes variable decisions and potential risks.\n\n【7】The success of methodone use in the maintenance treatment of heroin dependence is well documented.\n\n【8】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【9】*   Dole V.P.\n\n【10】Narcotic addiction, physical dependence and relapse.\n\n【11】_NEJM._ 1972; 286 : 988-992\n\n【12】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (62)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【13】The primary positive outcomes for this treatment include facilitating psychosocial stabilization, increasing treatment retention, reducing infections due to blood-borne pathogens, and reducing criminal behavior.

Although not considered a major hindrance to buprenorphine's use for the general population, cognitive deficits are of great concern to practicing HCPs, whether the deficits result from ongoing buprenorphine use or the opioid on which the HCP was originally dependent. State medical boards and state PHPs need to consider these data when evaluating whether an opioid-dependent HCP can return to work while taking buprenorphine.\n\n【33】Other problems with buprenorphine maintenance treatment exist. Nonopioid drug use (eg, benzodiazepines, cannabis) is common during maintenance treatment with buprenorphine and requires ongoing monitoring. The dropout rate is substantial for those on buprenorphine maintenance, often leading to opioid relapse.\n\n【34】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【35】*   Magura S.\n*   Lee S.J.\n*   Salsitz E.A.\n*   et al.\n\n【36】Outcomes of buprenorphine maintenance in office-based practice.\n\n【37】_J Addict Dis._ 2007; 26 : 13-23\n\n【38】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (32)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【39】Also, the abuse of buprenorphine appears to be increasing.

Buprenorphine can be used in doses higher than the daily maintenance dose to provide intermittent euphoria and intoxication. All of these factors need to be accounted for among HCPs, especially if the HCP is being considered for return to work in a safety-sensitive position.\n\n【46】Regarding opioid-abusing HCPs, considerable efforts have been made by numerous state PHPs to ensure abstinence, promote recovery from addiction, protect the public, and afford highly trained professionals the opportunity to return to their chosen fields. However, the survey on state policies regarding HCP work reentry while on buprenorphine treatment, provided by Hamza and Bryson, reveals significant concerns with such programs. The low response rate to their request for information and the lack of any standards among responders suggest a disorganized national system at best. Only under ideal monitoring should those with parenteral opioid dependence return to the health care workplace in settings that expose them to opioids. Without these ideal standards in place, abstinence rates will not be maximized, protection of the public cannot be ensured, and efficacy of such programs will continue to be questioned.\n\n【47】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【48】*   Berge K.\n*   Seppala M.\n*   Lanier W.\n\n【49】Correspondence.\n\n【50】_Anesthesiology._ 2009; 110 : 1426-1428\n\n【51】*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (4)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【52】State PHPs can be hesitant to ask HCPs to change their specialty or their practice, but such a change may be necessary for those with parenteral opioid dependence, even after appropriate medical treatment, because of the risk of relapse to using the dangerous and possibly lethal medications they encounter at work. The use of maintenance buprenorphine, with its potential to undermine cognitive functioning in a safety-sensitive clinical setting, may require HCP placement in a lower-risk occupational environment. For some, this may be a reasonable, even lifesaving, alternative. Time away from medical practice to prove abstinence and establish recovery behaviors is often recommended for parenteral opioid–dependent HCPs, but it is not standardized within the approach taken by individual states' PHPs. The American Association of Nurse Anesthetists (AANA) should be applauded for its clear, specific recommendations for nurse anesthetists with parenteral opioid dependence. The AANA recommends a minimum of 1 year away from the clinical anesthesia arena after a diagnosis of intravenous drug addiction or major opioid use.\n\n【53】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【54】http://www.aana.com/resources2/health-wellness/Pages/Re-entry-Recommendations.aspx\n\n【55】*   Google Scholar\n\n【56】Unfortunately, such recommendations do not exist for other medical specialties or personnel. Furthermore, we would welcome evidence-based guidelines from the Federation of State Physician Health Programs similar to those from the AANA.\n\n【57】Hamza and Bryson recommend against buprenorphine maintenance for HCPs with opioid dependence. Instead, they support _abstinence-based_ recovery consistent with the current standard utilized by PHPs.

Can buprenorphine maintenance be justified in the face of such data?\n\n【76】Hamza and Bryson state that potentially addictive substances when appropriately prescribed can interfere with mandatory drug testing and that their use may be “psychotoxic.” We disagree on both counts. Because positive urine toxicological results in HCPs are routinely confirmed by gas chromatography or mass spectrometry techniques, prescribed drugs do not interfere with mandatory drug testing. We object to the use of the term _psychotoxic_ because it is not defined. We are not aware of any published data that support the premise that buprenorphine maintenance therapy causes increased risk of relapse in HCPs.\n\n【77】It has been our experience in working in the physician health field for several years that hospitals and clinics are extremely concerned that HCPs who take potentially impairing medications, even when appropriately prescribed, constitute increased risk and liability for these institutions. Also, it is unclear whether a malpractice insurance company would support and insure a physician returning to work on buprenorphine maintenance. Initial, as yet unpublished, studies from PHPs suggest that physicians who are being monitored by PHPs (without buprenorphine treatment) have fewer malpractice claims during the monitored period (typically 5 years) than in the 5 years preceding treatment and monitoring (D. Gunderson, MD, oral communication, December 2011). Further favorable reports are anticipated to mitigate this concern on the part of hospitals and clinics for those physicians in monitoring, but they are unlikely to alter concerns over the potential cognitive impairment associated with buprenorphine maintenance in the health care workplace.\n\n【78】Finally, there may be an alternative to the use of opioid maintenance to reduce risk of relapse. A large treatment center (P. Earley, MD, and M. Oreskovich, MD, oral communication, December 2011) and a large PHP (P. Earley, MD, and M. Oreskovich, MD, oral communication, December 2011) have demonstrated a significant reduction in relapse when opioid-dependent HCPs receive monthly injections of depot naltrexone, an opioid antagonist drug that lacks the potentially intoxicating effects of buprenorphine. Routine use of this medication may negate the need or indication for buprenorphine maintenance among HCPs.\n\n【79】We agree wholeheartedly with Hamza and Bryson that caution is needed in decisions associated with the use of buprenorphine maintenance among HCPs returning to the health care workplace. The foundation information required to make good decisions regarding this medication in this population working in safety-sensitive positions is lacking. The use of a medication that has the potential to undermine cognitive function in HCPs working in an emergency or critical patient care setting cannot be supported at this time, given the lack of evidence of efficacy in this population and the absence of adequate national standards for its use. We do support national guidelines regarding the use of buprenorphine among HCPs in the workplace, with limits regarding the type of work appropriate for this patient population.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

In affected patients, postprandial glucose may be an early indicator of glucose intolerance or a prediabetes condition, which may be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than impaired fasting glucose level. Treating patients who have early signs of hyperglycemia, including elevated postprandial glucose level, with intensive glucose control that does not lead to weight gain, and ideally may be associated with weight reduction, may be vital to preventing or reducing later cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Because hypoglycemia is an important complication of current DM treatments and may cause acute secondary adverse cardiovascular outcomes, not causing hypoglycemia is mandatory. Given that weight loss can significantly lower cardiovascular risk and improve other cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 DM and that medications are available that can result in weight reduction without leading to hypoglycemia, the successful treatment of patients with type 2 DM should be individualized and should address the complete pathophysiologic process. This review is a hypothesis article that presents arguments against general approaches to the treatment of type 2 DM. An algorithm is presented in which the goal for managing patients with type 2 DM is to lower the blood glucose level as much as possible for as long as possible without causing hypoglycemia. In addition, body weight should ideally be improved, reducing cardiovascular risk factors and avoiding therapeutic inertia.\n\n【1】ACCORD ( Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes ), ADA ( American Diabetes Association ), ADVANCE ( Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release and Controlled Evaluation ), BMI ( body mass index ), BP ( blood pressure ), CHD ( coronary heart disease ), CVD ( cardiovascular disease ), DM ( diabetes mellitus ), DPP-4 ( dipeptidyl peptidase 4 ), EASD ( European Association for the Study of Diabetes ), FPG ( fasting plasma glucose ), GLP-1 ( glucagon-like peptide 1 ), HbA1c ( hemoglobin A1c ), HDL-C ( high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), IFG ( impaired fasting glucose ), IGT ( impaired glucose tolerance ), KORA ( Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg ), LDL-C ( low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ), LEAD ( Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes ), MI ( myocardial infarction ), MONICA ( MONItoring of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease ), NHANES ( National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ), PPG ( postprandial glucose ), PROACTIVE ( PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial In macroVascular Events ), TC ( total cholesterol ), VADT ( Veterans Administration Diabetes Trial )\n\n【2】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【3】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【4】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

For each ERT case, up to 2 controls matched for age (±10 years), sex, and type of procedure were identified. A chart review was performed to identify factors that may be associated with ERT activation.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified 181 postoperative ERT calls, 113 (62%) of which occurred within 12 hours of discharge from the postanesthesia care unit, for an incidence of 2 per 1000 anesthetic administrations (0.2%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed the following factors to be associated with increased odds for postoperative ERT activation: preoperative central nervous system comorbidity (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 2.53; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 1.20-5.32; _P_ \\=.01), preoperative opioid use (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.30-3.10; _P_ \\=.002), intraoperative use of phenylephrine infusion (OR, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.08-8.66; _P_ \\=.04), and increased intraoperative fluid administration (per 500-mL increase, OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; _P_ \\=.03). ERT patients had longer hospital stays, higher complication rates, and increased 30-day mortality compared with controls.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Preoperative opioid use, history of central neurologic disease, and intraoperative hemodynamic instability are associated with postoperative decompensation requiring ERT intervention. Patients with these clinical characteristics may benefit from discharge to progressive or intensive care units in the early postoperative period.\n\n【9】Emergency response teams (ERTs) have been introduced by hospitals to evaluate and manage hospitalized patients whose condition is acutely deteriorating.

Because we were primarily interested in perioperative factors, our study was limited to ERTs activated within the first 48 postoperative hours. Identification of factors associated with increased risk for these events may help to better triage patients and minimize adverse postoperative outcomes.\n\n【48】Patients and Methods\n--------------------\n\n【49】The approval for review of medical records was obtained from the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board in Rochester, MN. This study employed a retrospective case-control design that assessed potential factors associated with the need for an ERT activation after either surgery or diagnostic procedures that required anesthesia.\n\n【50】The Department of Anesthesiology at Mayo Clinic prospectively maintains a log of all ERT activations that occur at 2 Mayo Clinic-affiliated hospitals in Rochester: Saint Marys and Methodist. Using this log, we identified adult patients who required ERT activation within 48 hours of discharge from the PACU to regular wards from June 1, 2008, to December 31, 2009. (Regular ward refers to a standard nursing ward where patient vital signs are assessed at protocol-defined intervals as well as when clinically indicated. Care may include continuous pulse oximetry but not invasive monitoring as in an ICU or progressive care unit setting.) By June 1, 2008, the ERT activation log system had been fully implemented and was capturing 100% of events. The 48-hour time window was selected to allow identification of factors directly related to the intraoperative course. Surgical patients discharged to monitored wards were excluded. ( _Monitored ward_ is defined as an advanced patient care ward where patient vital signs are continually monitored as in an ICU or other specialized patient care areas where continual monitoring is indicated, eg, progressive care unit.) Patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, bronchoscopy, or childbirth were excluded. For each patient who required ERT activation, we used the Mayo Clinic medical record database to identify potential controls of the same sex and similar age (±10 years) who underwent the same procedure (as determined from _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision_ procedure codes) during the study period and did not have ERT activation in the first 48 postoperative hours. From these pools of potential controls, we randomly selected up to 2 controls for each ERT patient. For cases in which fewer than 2 potential controls could be identified, we did not select alternative controls.\n\n【51】### Indications for ERT Activations\n\n【52】At our institution an ERT consists of either a rapid response team (RRT) or code team. An RRT call can be initiated by any health care team member concerned about the acutely deteriorating medical condition of a patient. Typically at our institution, RRT calls are prompted as described by others,\n\n【53】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【54】*   Bellomo R.\n*   Goldsmith D.\n*   Uchino S.\n*   et al.\n\n【55】Prospective controlled trial of effect of medical emergency team on postoperative morbidity and mortality rates.\n\n【56】_Crit Care Med._ 2004; 32 : 916-921\n\n【57】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (377)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【58】and indications include the following: decline in oxyhemoglobin saturation (assessed by either pulse oximetry or clinical assessment), bradypnea, tachypnea, profound bradycardia or tachycardia, hypotension, concern for possible heart attack (“chest pain”), stroke (acute neurologic deficits), or acute mental status changes (agitation, delirium). However, an RRT call can be initiated for any other indication at the discretion of the health care team member. The RRT consists of an attending physician board-certified in critical care medicine, a critical care fellow or senior anesthesia resident, a respiratory therapist, and a critical care registered nurse. Code team activations are reserved for immediate life-threatening events (cardiopulmonary arrest, severe respiratory compromise that is assessed to require tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation) or profoundly unstable cardiac conditions (possibly requiring cardioversion, defibrillation). The code team is similar in structure to the RRT but consists of an additional critical care registered nurse, an internal medicine resident, and a pharmacist. The level of ERT (RRT or code team) activation is left to the discretion of the individual health care team member (ie, nurse caring for an unstable patient); thus it is prone to subjectivity. Therefore, the level of activation occasionally is erroneous (making a “mistake on the safe side” by activating the code team when the RRT would have been more appropriate). Regardless, the roles and capabilities of these 2 teams are closely interrelated. Because our interest was to examine patients who had an acute postoperative deterioration, we analyzed all ERT interventions, regardless of the level of activation.\n\n【59】### Data Abstraction\n\n【60】Electronic medical records were abstracted for demographics; comorbid conditions; preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables; postoperative course and complications; and details of the ERT activation. Comorbid conditions were defined according to definitions used for numerous outcome studies at Mayo Clinic,\n\n【61】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【62】*   Hosking M.P.\n*   Warner M.A.\n*   Lobdell C.M.\n*   Offord K.P.\n*   Melton L.J.\n\n【63】Outcomes of surgery in patients 90 years of age and older.\n\n【64】_JAMA._ 1989; 261 : 1909-1915\n\n【65】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (241)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【66】including cardiovascular disease (coronary artery disease \\[myocardial infarction, coronary stent placement, or cardiac bypass surgery\\], congestive heart failure or cardiomyopathy \\[ejection fraction <40%\\], the potential for cardiac dysrhythmia \\[atrial fibrillation or flutter, implanted pacemaker and/or automated defibrillator\\], arterial hypertension \\[medically treated\\], peripheral vascular disease), central neurologic disease (history of seizures, dementia, stroke, or transient ischemic attacks), pulmonary disease (asthma, chronic obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea), diabetes mellitus (medically treated), kidney disease, and preoperative scheduled use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines. Overall physical status was assessed from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status score.\n\n【67】The anesthetic record was reviewed for anesthesia duration, anesthetic method (general, regional), urgency (elective, emergent), muscle relaxant use, blood transfusion, fluid administration, and perioperative complications. Complications included hemodynamic instability or systemic arterial hypotension (inferred by use of vasopressor infusion as a surrogate for recalcitrant hypotension), need for cardioversion, adverse respiratory events, or other severe perioperative complication.\n\n【68】All data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools hosted at Mayo Clinic.\n\n【69】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【70】*   Harris P.A.\n*   Taylor R.\n*   Thielke R.\n*   Payne J.\n*   Gonzalez N.\n*   Conde J.G.\n\n【71】Research electronic data capture (REDCap)–a metadata-driven methodology and workflow process for providing translational research informatics support.\n\n【72】_J Biomed Inform._ 2009; 42 : 377-381\n\n【73】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (25804)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【74】ERT notes were abstracted and supplemented by review of the medication administration record, ICU admission note, subsequent progress notes, and discharge summaries. Data abstracted included the probable primary cause of the ERT activation: hypotension from hypovolemia or distributive shock, respiratory cause, cardiac cause, hypertensive crisis, neurologic causes such as mental status changes, uncontrolled pain, psychiatric reasons, or drug reactions. The following interventions were recorded: respiratory (tracheal intubation, application of a noninvasive ventilatory device such as a continuous positive airway pressure device, bronchodilator administration), cardiac (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, defibrillation or cardioversion, administration of vasoactive drugs, nitroglycerin, antiarrhythmic drugs, or diuretics), intravenous fluid bolus or blood product administration, glucose administration, or administration of analgesics, sedatives, naloxone, flumazenil, or antipsychotics. Immediate outcome of the ERT was categorized as follows: remained in the previous hospital setting with or without intervention, transfer to a monitored ward, transfer to the operating room for exploration or treatment, or death.\n\n【75】### Outcomes\n\n【76】Postoperative complications that occurred within the first 30 postoperative days were reported. Information was obtained from the medical records from the index hospitalization, rehospitalization, or outpatient visits. A 30-day mortality rate was calculated. Postoperative complications included myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular event, respiratory failure requiring tracheal reintubation, acute kidney injury (serum creatinine increase >1 mg/dL and above 1.5 mg/dL \\[to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4\\]), thromboembolic event, sepsis or multiorgan failure, blood transfusion requirement, or death. Causes of death were recorded. Total days in the ICU and hospital were recorded.\n\n【77】### Statistical Analyses\n\n【78】Data are summarized using mean ± SD or median with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables and frequency percentage for nominal variables. To estimate the incidence of ERT activation, a denominator was obtained using information provided by the revenue accounting office; it was based on patient counts after excluding all surgical or procedural categories of patients expected to be admitted to monitored wards (eg, cardiac, major vascular, thoracic). Of note, this denominator was not reduced to account for other planned or unplanned admissions to monitored wards in patients undergoing operations that do not routinely require this level of postoperative care. Two sets of analyses comparing characteristics between ERT cases and controls were performed. One analysis included all ERT cases and compared characteristics between cases and controls using the 2-sample _t_ test for continuous variables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables. The other analysis excluded ERT cases for which no matched controls could be identified and was performed using conditional logistic regression, taking into account the matched study design. Characteristics found to have evidence ( _P_ <.05) of an association in univariate analyses were included as explanatory variables in a multiple logistic regression model with ERT activation as the dependent variable. In all cases, 2-tailed _P_ values of .05 or less were considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using SAS statistical software (Version 9.2, SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).\n\n【79】Results\n-------\n\n【80】During the study period approximately 95,000 patients underwent surgery or diagnostic procedures requiring anesthesia and were discharged to a regular ward. Of those, 181 patients required ERT activation within 48 hours; therefore, the estimated rate of ERT activation in this population was 2 per 1000 anesthetic administrations (0.2%). Of these events, 168 (93%) were RRT, and 13 (7%) were code team activations. Of the code team activations, 6 met the institutional definition of a code (5 patients received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and in one patient the trachea was intubated to protect the airway in the context of acute mental status changes). In the other 7 patients, the code team was activated for reasons other than cardiopulmonary collapse (eg, transient syncope, hypotension). Of the entire cohort, 81 patients (45%) underwent general or urologic surgery; 62 (34%), orthopedic surgery; 19 (10%), gynecologic surgery; 11 (6%), otolaryngological surgery; 5 (3%), neurosurgery; and l3 (7%), diagnostic procedures or minor operations requiring anesthetic care outside the operating room.\n\n【81】The majority (N=113; 62.4%) of ERT interventions occurred during the first 12 hours after surgery, and more than three-fourths (142; 78.5%) occurred within the first 24 hours ( Figure ). The mean time from ERT activation to team arrival was 4±2 minutes. Table 1 describes the reasons for ERT activation and types of interventions. The most frequent reasons for ERT activation were hypotension in 58 patients (32%), cardiac in 36 (20%), and pulmonary in 31 (17%). In all cases a physician on the ERT assessed the patient and made decisions regarding treatment and disposition. Immediate outcomes of ERT activation are summarized in Table 1 .\n\n【82】FIGURE Cumulative frequency of time to emergency response team (ERT) activation.\n\n【83】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【84】TABLE 1 Causes for Emergency Response Team (ERT) Activation and Specific Interventions During ERT Call\n\n| Characteristic | Patients (N=181) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes for ERT activation | Causes for ERT activation |\n| Hypotension | 58 (32) |\n| Cardiac | 36 (20) |\n| Pulmonary | 31 (17) |\n| Neurologic | 23 (13) |\n| Pain/psychiatric issues | 17 (9) |\n| Drug interactions | 12 (7) |\n| Hypertension | 3 (2) |\n| Epistaxis | 1 (1) |\n| Specific interventions | Specific interventions |\n| Chest compressions | 5 (3) |\n| Defibrillation/cardioversion | 2 (1) |\n| Tracheal intubation | 5 (3) |\n| Noninvasive ventilation | 9 (5) |\n| Other interventions and medications administered | Other interventions and medications administered |\n| Intravenous fluid bolus | 63 (35) |\n| Naloxone | 16 (9) |\n| Opioids | 12 (7) |\n| Blood transfusion | 10 (6) |\n| Vasopressors (epinephrine, phenylephrine) | 5 (3) |\n| Bronchodilator | 5 (3) |\n| Benzodiazepine | 3 (2) |\n| Anticholinergic (atropine) | 2 (1) |\n| Flumazenil | 2 (1) |\n| Antiarrhythmic (amiodarone) | 2 (1) |\n| Diuretic (furosemide) | 1 (1) |\n| 50% glucose intravenous bolus | 2 (1) |\n| Antihypertensive (labetalol, hydralazine) | 1 (1) |\n| Nitroglycerin | 1 (1) |\n| Immediate outcome | Immediate outcome |\n| Death | 2 (1) |\n| Transfer to surgery | 4 (2) |\n| Transfer to monitored ward | 71 (39) |\n| Treatment on regular ward | 57 (32) |\n| Continued observation on regular ward | 47 (26) |\n\n【86】Data are presented as No. (percentage).\n\n【87】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【88】The median ICU length of stay of patients transferred to a monitored ward was 2 days (IQR, 2-4 days). Two patients died during code team calls, both from massive saddle pulmonary emboli associated with a cardiac arrest. The administration of a fluid bolus (N=63; 35%) was the most common overall intervention, followed by naloxone administration (N=16; 9%) and opioid administration (N=12; 7%) ( Table 1 ).\n\n【89】Using previously described matching criteria, we identified 318 controls for these 181 ERT patients. For 154 ERT patients (85%) we identified 2 matched controls; for 10 ERT patients (6%) only 1 control could be identified, and for 17 ERT patients (9%) no controls could be identified because the patient underwent an operation that was uncommon or that rarely requires anesthesia. Clinical and demographic features of ERT cases and controls are summarized in Table 2 . ERT and control groups were similar with the exceptions of higher rates of central neurologic diseases and preoperative use of opioid analgesics in ERT patients.

To avoid serious morbidities, it is important to anticipate potential problems so that preemptive measures can be implemented. Our study demonstrated that preoperative scheduled use of opioids, history of central neurologic disease, and hemodynamic instability during surgery were characteristics independently associated with unexpected deterioration within the first 48 postoperative hours. The majority of ERT calls occurred within the first 24 postoperative hours, most often for hypotension, mental status changes, or respiratory problems. Despite the fact that some patients in the ERT cohort required minimal to no intervention, ERT patients had more severe in-hospital complications.\n\n【128】ERTs have been established to intervene quickly to mitigate sudden deterioration of patients' health. Although this initiative intuitively appears effective, ERT outcomes are difficult to assess.

At our institution we correct brief episodes of hypotension with boluses of ephedrine or phenylephrine but typically initiate phenylephrine infusions, in addition to fluid boluses, when hypotension persists. Of note, these patients received more intraoperative fluids (crystalloids and colloids) compared with the average amounts given to the remainder of ERT patients (see footnote to Table 3 ). We consequently used the initiation of “phenylephrine infusion” as a surrogate for more pronounced hemodynamic instability. At our institution, phenylephrine infusion is considered a temporizing measure to correct for factors associated with perioperative hypotension, and it is widely viewed as a benign intervention. However, among ERT patients who required phenylephrine infusion, postoperative hypotension was the most common indication for ERT activation. Therefore, our perception that a phenylephrine infusion is not a marker for subsequent instability, even after a stable hemodynamic course in the PACU, needs to be reexamined. Another study demonstrated that intraoperative hypotension predicts postoperative adverse events.\n\n【241】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【242】*   Kheterpal S.\n*   O'Reilly M.\n*   Englesbe M.J.\n*   et al.\n\n【243】Preoperative and intraoperative predictors of cardiac adverse events after general, vascular, and urological surgery.\n\n【244】_Anesthesiology._ 2009; 110 : 58-66\n\n【245】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (196)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【246】A third predictor was a history of central neurologic disease.

The relatively small number of patients in our study with this condition precludes us from making a general recommendation regarding preemptive triage of these patients to a higher level of postoperative care. Furthermore, the hospital outcomes of these patients were good; more than 50% did not require transfer to a higher level of care after ERT activation.\n\n【259】The PACU course was generally uneventful in our patients, which is not surprising because to be included in our study, they needed to be in sufficiently stable condition to warrant discharge to regular wards.\n\n【260】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【261】*   Aldrete J.A.\n\n【262】The post-anesthesia recovery score revisited.\n\n【263】_J Clin Anesth._ 1995; 7 : 89-91\n\n【264】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (997)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【265】A study of respiratory and cardiovascular events in the PACU demonstrated that tachycardia and hypertension were predictive of unplanned ICU admission and increased mortality, demonstrating a relationship between early postoperative clinical deterioration and long-term outcomes.\n\n【266】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【267】*   Rose D.K.\n*   Cohen M.M.\n*   DeBoer D.P.\n\n【268】Cardiovascular events in the postanesthesia care unit: contribution of risk factors.\n\n【269】_Anesthesiology._ 1996; 84 : 772-781\n\n【270】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (88)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【271】Furthermore, this study revealed a strong tendency for patients to exhibit similar cardiovascular events intraoperatively and in the PACU.\n\n【272】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【273】*   Rose D.K.\n*   Cohen M.M.\n*   DeBoer D.P.\n\n【274】Cardiovascular events in the postanesthesia care unit: contribution of risk factors.\n\n【275】_Anesthesiology._ 1996; 84 : 772-781\n\n【276】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (88)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【277】In our study, patients with intraoperative hypotension had unremarkable PACU stays, and yet some experienced subsequent hemodynamic instability. This suggests that the aggressive volume replacement combined with intensive monitoring maintained hemodynamic stability throughout the PACU stay. However, the underlying comorbidities or conditions that led to subsequent instability after discharge to a regular ward were either not manifest or not recognized in the PACU.\n\n【278】This is a retrospective study with all inherent limitations. Because we limited our study to ERT calls during the first 48 postoperative hours, we could have missed significant complications that occurred outside that time frame but still were related to anesthesia and surgery. Despite the existence of well-defined clinical criteria for ERT activation, considerable subjectivity is involved. More specifically, activation is triggered typically by allied health care professionals with varied levels of training; therefore, some ERT activations were initiated for noncritical reasons (eg, epistaxis), which affects the ability to identify factors associated with increased odds for more severe events. This is reflected in our data in that 47 ERT activations (26%) resulted in no intervention by the team. This is also the reason why we decided to include cases from both RRT and code team activations; ie, the reasons why one team was activated over the other are at times arbitrary. Regardless, we think that activation of either team represents an acute unexpected health decompensation and thus is relevant for study. We believe our reported incidence represents an underestimate because invariably some patients were discharged to the ICU for other reasons but were still included in the denominator. However, our incidence of 0.2% is similar to a previous report.\n\n【279】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【280】*   Lee A.\n*   Lum M.E.\n*   O'Regan W.J.\n*   Hillman K.M.\n\n【281】Early postoperative emergencies requiring an intensive care team intervention: the role of ASA physical status and after-hours surgery.\n\n【282】_Anaesthesia._ 1998; 53 : 529-535\n\n【283】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (30)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【284】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【285】Patients with preoperative central neurologic disease, scheduled preoperative opioid use, or intraoperative hemodynamic instability were found to be at increased risk for ERT activation within 48 postoperative hours.

Several clinical studies have shown that during ART, bone loss is an early event and occurs rapidly, especially within 6 months of initiation. The Strategies for Man agement of Antiretroviral Therapy (SMART) study has shown that institution of an ART may be followed by a 6% decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) during the first 2 years regardless of the drug combination. Furthermore, continuous ART is associated with reduced BMD and increased fracture risk compared with intermittent, CD4 cell count-guided ART.\n\n【9】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【10】*   Grund B\n*   Peng G\n*   Gibert CL\n*   et al.\n\n【11】Continuous antiretroviral therapy decreases bone mineral density.\n\n【12】_AIDS._ 2009; 23 : 1519-1529\n\n【13】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (188)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【14】Therefore, osteopenia/osteoporosis, occasionally osteomalacia, and an increased risk of fracture are reported as major adverse effects of ART, especially in a regimen including the nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor tenofovir\n\n【15】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【16】*   Fux CA\n*   Rauch A\n*   Simcock M\n*   et al.\n\n【17】Tenofovir use is associated with an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study.\n\n【18】_Antivir Ther._ 2008; 13 : 1077-1082\n\n【19】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【20】and protease inhibitors.\n\n【21】The mechanism by which antiretroviral drugs act on the bone is multifactorial and not completely clear but is mediated in part by a direct effect on osteoblasts and osteoclasts, increased catabolism of vitamin D, and mitochondrial damage. Interestingly, the mitochondrial damage can also cause proximal renal tubulopathy. Indeed, 1.6% to 22% of tenofovir-treated patients experience phosphate wasting and 1-hydroxylation defects of vitamin D due to proximal renal tubulopathy, leading to osteomalacia with multiple fractures, bone pain, and proximal muscle weakness.\n\n【22】According to the European AIDS Clinical Society guidelines, in HIV-positive patients, especially those treated with ART, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry should be performed; if BMD is abnormal, secondary causes of osteoporosis should be ruled out (eg, hypovitaminosis D, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, malabsorption, hypogonadism/amenorrhea, autoimmune diseases, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver diseases), and lateral lumbar and thoracic spine radiography should be performed. If hypophosphatemia is present, a diagnosis of renal Fanconi syndrome should be considered.\n\n【23】Currently, ART-induced bone loss can be managed with a reduction of risk factors for osteoporosis, including ensuring vitamin D supplementation (800–2000 IU of vitamin D <sub>3 </sub> daily\n\n【24】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【25】*   European AIDS Clinical Society\n\n【26】ProMED-mail Web site.\n\n【27】www.europea-naidsclinicalsociety.org/guidelines/g2.htm\n\n【28】*   Google Scholar\n\n【29】or up to 2000 IU in patients treated with efavirenz\n\n【30】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【31】*   Fabbriciani G\n*   De Socio GV\n\n【32】Efavirenz and bone health \\[letter\\].\n\n【33】_AIDS._ 2009; 23 : 1181\n\n【34】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (17)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【35】) to maintain a plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration greater than 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L).

Holley, Har Gobind Khorana (1922-), and Marshall W. Nirenberg (1927-), for research that helped to explain how genetic components of the cell nucleus control the synthesis of proteins. Holley was the first scientist to determine exactly the internal structure of a strand of one of the nucleic acids that helps build protein in living cells according to a genetic master plan. He developed techniques for determining the structure of nucleic acids and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of alanine transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA). Khorana, working at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, developed methods for investigating the structure of nucleic acids and provided the codons (sequences of nucleotides that code for amino acids) for several amino acids. Nirenberg, working at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md, developed the procedure for deciphering the genetic code in living cells. The work of these 3 laureates contributed substantially to the understanding of genetic mechanisms and protein synthesis.\n\n【2】Holley was born on January 28, 1922, in Urbana, Ill. Both his parents were schoolteachers. He received his early education in the public school systems of Illinois, California, and Idaho. After graduating from Urbana High School in 1938, he entered the University of Illinois at Urbana and received a BA degree in chemistry in 1942.\n\n【3】During World War II, Holley joined the US Office of Research and Development and worked at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. He was part of the team that, from 1944 to 1946, first synthesized penicillin. After the war, he was appointed a National Research Council Fellow at Cornell University and completed his formal education there, receiving his PhD degree in biochemistry in 1947.\n\n【4】After receiving his doctorate, Holley was awarded a fellowship from the American Chemical Society, which enabled him to spend 1 year (1947-1948) doing postdoctoral research at Washington State College in Pullman. In 1948, he returned to Cornell University as an assistant professor of organic chemistry, doing research at the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, a branch of Cornell University located in Geneva, NY. In 1957, he was appointed research chemist at the US Plant, Soil, and Nutrition Laboratory at Cornell University, and in 1964, he was promoted to professor of biochemistry and named chairman of the department. During these years, he began to study the biochemistry of the nucleic acids. Except for a sabbatical leave, Holley remained at Cornell University from 1948 to 1966.\n\n【5】In 1966, Holley was awarded a National Science Foundation Fellowship and spent a year doing research at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif. In 1968, Holley was named American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology and was a resident fellow at the Salk Institute. In 1969, he was named adjunct professor of the University of California at San Diego.\n\n【6】Holley was granted a 1-year sabbatical from Cornell University in 1955 to work at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena as a Guggenheim Fellow doing research with biochemist and molecular biologist James Frederick Bonner (1910-1996). Holley began his prize-winning work at Caltech in 1955-1956 and completed it as a research chemist at Cornell University. He returned to Cornell University in 1957 and spent 3 years isolating 1 g of alanine tRNA from 90 kg of yeast. On March 19, 1965, Holley and colleagues announced in _Science_ that they had identified the complete sequence of 77 nucleotides of alanine tRNA. They had determined the composition of tRNA that incorporates the amino acid alanine into protein molecules. This feat-the first determination of the sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid- required digesting the molecules with enzymes, identifying the pieces, and figuring out how they fit together. Since that work, all tRNAs have been shown to have a similar structure.\n\n【7】Holley died of lung cancer on February 11, 1993, at the age of 71 years in Los Gatos, about 8 miles southwest of San Jose, Calif. Besides the Nobel Prize, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Award of the US Department of Agriculture (1965), the Lasker Award (1965), and the US Steel Foundation Award of the National Academy of Sciences (1967). He was honored on a stamp issued in 2000 by the Palau Islands that includes a portrait of Khorana, one of his Nobel Prize cowinners.\n\n【8】Article info\n------------\n\n【9】### Identification\n\n【10】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/79.9.1102\n\n【11】### Copyright\n\n【12】© 2004 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Study participants had an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> or more 6 months before exercise testing and no evidence of CKD. Those who developed CKD during follow-up were initially identified by the _International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision_ and further verified by at least 2 consecutive estimated glomerular filtration rate values of less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> 3 months or more apart. Normal kidney function for CKD-free individuals was confirmed by sequential normal eGFR levels. We established 4 fitness categories on the basis of age-stratified quartiles of peak metabolic equivalents (METs) achieved: least-fit (≤25%; 4.8±0.90 METs; n=1258); low-fit (25.1%-50%; 6.5±0.96 METs; n=1614); moderate-fit (50.1%-75%; 7.7±0.91 METs; n=1958), and high-fit (>75%; 9.5±1.0 METs; n=1436). Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the association between exercise capacity and CKD.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】During a median follow-up period of 7.9 years, 1010 developed CKD (20.4/1000 person-years). Exercise capacity was inversely related to CKD incidence. The risk was 22% lower (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.75-0.82; _P_ <.001) for every 1-MET increase in exercise capacity. Compared with the least-fit individuals, hazard ratios were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.74-1.03) for low-fit, 0.55 (95% CI, 0.47-0.65) for moderate-fit, and 0.42 (95% CI, 0.33-0.52) for high-fit individuals.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Higher exercise capacity attenuated the risk of developing CKD.

We excluded moribund patients with ICHs who died within 12 hours of hospital admission. Cardiac troponin T levels measured on admission and day 2 were determined by a third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Continuous ECG monitoring was performed in all patients. Computed tomographic scans were graded and correlated with abnormal cardiac variables.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Peak levels of cTnT were elevated at 0.035 to 1.2 μg/L (mean ± SD, 0.27±0.38 μg/L) in 10 (20%) of 49 patients and were not associated with changes in creatine kinase MB fraction or ECG results. The cTnT levels did not correlate with location or side of hemorrhage or mortality at 30 days. Seventy (64%) of 110 patients displayed ECG abnormalities. The ECG changes did not correlate with the location or side of ICH, hydrocephalus, midline shift, or extension to the ventricles.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】The cTnT elevations in survivors of acute ICH are frequent but without confirmatory ECG changes that suggest mild myocardial injury. One-month mortality is not influenced by such cTnT elevations. In addition, ECG abnormalities are common but likely benign in patients with supratentorial ICH who survive the initial insult.\n\n【8】cTnI ( cardiac troponin I ), cTnT ( cardiac troponin T ), ECG ( electrocardiograpic ), ICH ( intracerebral hemorrhage ), NICU ( neurologic intensive care unit ), SAH ( subarachnoid hemorrhage )\n\n【9】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】One-time access price info\n\n【13】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】### Subscribe:\n\n【15】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】Already a print subscriber?

The concept that physician availability is not just a “medical profession” problem but clearly a major societal issue is obviously appropriate. Therefore, a committee to represent the intellectual and pragmatic framework of physician availability is an excellent recommendation.\n\n【1】Of prime importance is whether this recommendation will avoid the consistent failures of the past in predicting and managing physician requirements, such as the Abt analysis commissioned by the ASA.\n\n【2】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【3】*   American Society of Anesthesiologists\n\n【4】Estimation of Physician Work Force Requirements in Anesthesiology.

The lack of political influence and/or bureaucratic obstructions would likely produce a more objective analysis and some possibility of implementation.\n\n【7】Even if entirely logical and appropriate recommendations result, do they have any chance of being implemented? Even when faced with objectively obtained evidence, governmental agencies often do not respond. For example, California has had a manpower shortage in several specialties for more than 4 years. Yet this state has not modified the requirement that its 5 public medical schools restrict the number of specialists trained. The responsibility for this failure to respond to current demographic conditions is probably shared by the medical profession, the State of California, and the University of California. Another example of apparent bureaucratic stalling is that in 1999 the Institute of Medicine recommended that “the development, manufacture, and stock piling of an improved smallpox vaccine for post-attack management of a potential epidemic should be given a high priority” in their report _Chemical and Biological Terrorism._\n\n【8】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【9】*   Committee on R&D Needs for Improving Civilian Medical Response to Chemical and Biological Terrorism Incidents\n*   Institute of Medicine\n\n【10】Chemical and Biological Terrorism: Research and Development to Improve Civilian Medical Response.

A brief survey of the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database at the time of this report shows that, as of June 2007, 1-year survival after liver transplant was 82.1% for adults and 86.2% for children (based on almost 15,000 patients who underwent transplant).\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】*   OPTN: Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network\n\n【3】OPTN Web site.\n\n【4】http://www.optn.org\n\n【5】*   Google Scholar\n\n【6】However, in 2006, the last year for which data are available, only 6600 of 11,000 new patients placed on the liver transplant list received a new graft.

It is interesting to note that, of the 150 patients whose disease stage was considered too early, only 13 (9%) were subsequently listed during the study period (most likely when their clinical status worsened), with an additional 26 (17%) listed in the follow-up period. Aranda-Michel et al do not specify the average MELD score of patients whose disease stage was considered too early, but we can infer that most had a score of less than 15. Of the patients who were accepted for listing, the average MELD score was 21. Patients who were listed with a MELD score of less than 15 were likely either clinically sicker than their actual score implied or had been assigned a higher score based on an HCC exception or on an appeal to the regional review board.\n\n【75】Transplant practitioners who are responsible for placing patients on transplant lists face many challenges. One of them is the evolving concept of listing and performing transplants on patients with HCC.

Aranda-Michel et al do not specifically describe their criteria for excluding patients with HCC, but they can be presumed to have followed current regulations. In their study, 10% of patients were denied because the tumor did not meet their institutional criteria. One wonders how many of these patients would have been eligible for transplant if they had been followed by a transplant team early on in their disease, when the tumor was either not yet present or had dimensions that did not exceed the exclusion criteria.\n\n【106】Also of note are the increasing age of patients at transplant and the expected progression of their comorbidities. Obesity, cardiac disease, pulmonary disease, and diabetes, coupled with preexisting or worsening renal insufficiency, have a key role in patient selection. In the study of Aranda-Michel et al, 15% of patients were excluded because of substantial comorbid illnesses. The authors do not specify which comorbid illnesses were more frequent; however, a trend seems to exist to “push the envelope” for transplant in increasingly sicker patients, even if this would mean that patients who had been previously denied ultimately underwent transplant. The renal transplant literature provides a telling example: potential kidney graft recipients who were significantly obese underwent successful gastric bypass surgery to reduce their body mass index and thereby improve their chances of transplant.\n\n【107】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【108】*   Alexander JW\n*   Goodman H\n\n【109】Gastric bypass in chronic renal failure and transplant.\n\n【110】_Nutr Clin Pract._ 2007; 22 : 16-21\n\n【111】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (85)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【112】Similarly, in the field of pulmonary hypertension, aggressive perioperative intravenous treatment with prostaglandin analogues has been used to sustain patients through subsequent liver transplant, thereby achieving acceptable survival.\n\n【113】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【114】*   Vater Y\n*   Martay K\n*   Dembo G\n*   Bowdle TA\n*   Weinbroum AA\n\n【115】Intraoperative epoprostenol and nitric oxide for severe pulmonary hypertension during orthotopic liver transplantation: a case report and review of the literature.\n\n【116】_Med Sci Monit._ 2006 Dec; 12 ( Epub 2006 Nov 23. ) : CS115-CS118\n\n【117】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【118】Expanding the candidate pool will only increase the gap between organ availability and need.\n\n【119】The most important point made by Aranda-Michel et al is the need for early referral at any given stage of liver disease. Using a multispecialty approach to evaluation, liver transplant surgeons and transplant hepatologists can optimize medical therapy from the moment of referral to the transplant center until transplant. Viral hepatitis can be treated, if deemed appropriate. The specialty team can perform adequate surveillance for HCC and other cirrhosis-related complications, such as hepatopulmonary syndrome or pulmonary hypertension. Social issues (such as alcohol or narcotics addiction, family support, and insurance coverage) can be followed longitudinally to ensure optimal postoperative adherence and improve long-term graft and patient survival.\n\n【120】The concept of _minimal listing criteria,_ whereby any patient who meets such criteria is referred for listing, was studied at Mayo Clinic before the implementation of the MELD system.\n\n【121】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【122】*   Talwalkar JA\n*   Kim WR\n*   Rosen CB\n*   Kamath PS\n*   Wiesner RH\n\n【123】Effects of minimal listing criteria on waiting list registration for liver transplantation: a process-outcome analysis.\n\n【124】_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2003; 78 : 431-435\n\n【125】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (4)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【126】The process-outcome analysis at that time showed an increase both in the number of registered patients and in the rate of first-time patient referral. In the current MELD era, it is reasonable to believe that listing only when a patient has a definite chance to receive an offer for transplant can reduce in-list waiting times, while concomitantly increasing the average MELD score on the list. Conversely, no penalty is paid for placing a patient on the list even if he/she has a low score because the MELD system does not give any weight to time spent on the list, other than for patients with the same score.\n\n【127】One could argue that keeping a long list of active patients with low MELD scores could burden the system. However, many patients can experience a sudden decompensation of their liver disease, which would rapidly increase their MELD score. If such patients have completed and updated their clinical evaluations and are already listed for transplant, the liver transplant center would need only to update the score in the national system, avoiding undue time lapses. In contrast, listing after such rapid decompensation could be delayed for patients who have been denied previously because their disease stage was too early and so might not have completed all necessary tests for listing (eg, cardiac status clearance by a stress echocardiogram). In the end, the most important concept advanced by Aranda-Michel et al is that patients should be referred early and followed up by a team of liver transplant specialists. All tests necessary for the workup could be updated periodically so as not to delay placement on the active transplant list; placement on the list would depend instead on the internal policies of each center.\n\n【128】Some centers might prefer to apply a more restrictive approach, listing only patients with MELD scores of 15 or higher, as advocated by Aranda-Michel et al. Others might prefer instead to list most patients presented to their selection committee, even those with scores lower than the accepted MELD of 15. As long as longitudinal follow-up by the transplant team is performed, there will be an advantage for all patients with end-stage liver disease; that advantage could in turn lead to a lower mortality rate.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Of 1501 patients with diabetes, renal data were available for 1431.

This crisis has profoundly stressed health care systems and the nation’s capability in caring for patients afflicted by the disease; has imposed pervasive economic hardships with incalculable consequences; has altered our behavior by the need for social distancing and the wearing of face masks, by proscribing meetings and gatherings, and by eliciting shelter-in-place directives; has limited the freedom of travel and the ready supply of things we all took for granted; and has left us still dazed by its unanticipated appearance, its rapid dissemination, and the fearsomeness of its present and future impact.

These articles are freely available at our website ( http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ) at our Coronavirus (COVID-19) Resource Center. Such articles address salient aspects of COVID-19 including _Commentaries_ that discuss/provide the following: a guide to understanding the 2019 novel coronavirus and a broad outline of its biology and the disease it causes; the shortages in medicines and other medical supplies during the crisis, and strategies that may mitigate such deficiencies; diagnostic and treatment challenges in suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients with potentially life-threatening diseases such as myocardial infarction, balancing, on the one hand, the need to diagnose and prevent fatality from such diseases, and, on the other, avoiding unnecessary procedures that may expose staff and personnel to COVID-19; and analyses of the Italian COVID-19 outbreak, including predisposing circumstances and persisting concerns, and strategies that promote cohesiveness and efficacy of medical care. There are _Perspectives_ on assorted topics that include the following: the description of the spectrum and nuances of clinical symptoms and presentation as seen in a large urban ambulatory COVID-19 clinic; the delineation of the sobering significance of false-negative COVID-19 results that incurs the dual risks of either sustaining the contagion or causing a second wave phenomenon should a plateau of cases eventually occur; an in-depth discussion of the ethical considerations in the conduct of medical research during this crisis; and an outlining of challenges imposed by the COVID-19 crisis on medical education.\n\n【8】In this online collection there are two _Special Articles_ , one of which deals with possible arrhythmogenic risks associated with the repurposing of antimalarial drugs (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine) as therapeutic agents for COVID-19. These drugs carry the risk of prolonging the QTc interval on the ECG and causing sudden cardiac death, especially when used in conjunction with other drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir and macrolides. This article provides an algorithm regarding the assessment of such risks when these drugs are used and is based on the determination of QTc by standard ECG, telemetry strips, or a smart phone. Another _Special Article_ addresses the concerns regarding the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in patients with COVID-19; this article concludes that the potential benefits of these agents outweigh the possible risks and that these drugs should not be stopped. An _Original Article_ examines outcomes in 140 patients cared for at Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, and demonstrates that hypoxemia is a key risk factor for mortality in COVID-19. Other contributions in our collection include _Letters to the Editor,_ discussing, for example, the need for more attention directed to the risk and occurrence of COVID-19 in pediatric populations, and the apparent efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in COVID-19.\n\n【9】This collection of papers on COVID-19 at our website is dynamic and will steadily expand as new content is added.

Out of all this will come – as may occur during and in the aftermath of a _Black Swan_ phenomenon - new paradigms and innovation that, with each and every hope, would benefit patient care and welfare; the fitness of health care systems, in general, and their preparedness and adaptability in times of emergency and other pandemics; the pursuit and conduct of medical education; and progress in and the contributions of biomedical research.

In the accompanying editorial, it is unclear how Berge and Morse derived their point that care of patients with AWS is best delivered by specialists in chemical dependency. The findings from the research by Hecksel et al are emblematic of the consistently low standards of identification of alcohol problems and their treatment across the entire health care system—not of the need for more specialists. Although the evidence base for identification and treatment of alcohol disorders continues to grow, translating this evidence into clinical practice is rife with problems. These problems are not specific to Mayo Clinic and speak to national issues in poor execution, the danger of bias, and the need for better systems of care for chronic medical problems. As an example, a 2003 study in _The New England Journal of Medicine_ noted the remarkable level of inadequate quality of care for multiple common medical conditions.\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】*   McGlynn EA\n*   Asch SM\n*   Adams J\n*   et al.\n\n【3】The quality of health care delivered to adults in the United States.\n\n【4】_N Engl J Med._ 2003; 348 : 2635-2645\n\n【5】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (4010)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【6】Disturbingly, only 10.5% of patients with alcohol dependence received recommended treatment, clearly last among the 25 conditions.\n\n【7】**Poor Execution.** The validity and utility of the CIWA-Ar protocol, when used appropriately, are not in question and are supported by evidence and the authors' findings. However, there are 2 critical decision points in using the CIWA-Ar. The first decision point is identification/recognition of an alcohol use disorder. The second decision point is whether the patient should be placed on the protocol for possible AWS. The real-life application of the protocol evidenced failure in clinical execution at both decision points.\n\n【8】Alcohol use disorders, although costly,\n\n【9】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【10】*   World Health Organization, Dept of Mental Health and Substance Abuse\n\n【11】Global status report on alcohol. 2004.\n\n【12】http://www.who.int/substance\\_abuse/publications/global\\_status\\_report\\_2004\\_overview.pdf\n\n【13】*   Google Scholar\n\n【14】highly prevalent, and the third-leading “actual” cause of death in the United States,\n\n【15】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【16】*   Mokdad AH\n*   Marks JS\n*   Stroup DF\n*   Gerberding JL\n\n【17】Actual causes of death in the United States, 2000.\n\n【18】_JAMA._ 2004; 291 : 1238-1245\n\n【19】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (4425)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【20】are vastly underrecognized.

The article by Hecksel et al further emphasizes the real danger posed to patients by our inability to consistently screen and identify alcohol problems in all patients. Even though denial and minimization of alcohol use occur, sensitive survey instruments and laboratory screening are available for alcohol use disorders. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C), which was developed by the World Health Organization and which consists of 3 questions, is highly sensitive and specific for alcohol problems and, most importantly, can be used time-effectively in clinical practice.\n\n【27】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【28】*   Reinert DF\n*   Allen JP\n\n【29】The alcohol use disorders identification test: an update of research findings.\n\n【30】_Alcohol Clin Exp Res._ 2007; 31 : 185-199\n\n【31】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1030)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【32】Developing a better system of identifying alcohol problems in all clinical settings is “low-hanging fruit” in our effort to improve the quality of health care. I argue that the primary need identified by Hecksel et al is the need for systematic identification of alcohol use disorders.\n\n【33】The decision to place a patient on the CIWA-Ar protocol is predicated on whether the patient is currently using alcohol and is at risk of AWS. To assess the risk of withdrawal accurately, the clinician must ascertain whether the patient has been actively using alcohol and must obtain this history from the patient directly or via collateral sources. Lack of such information leads to problems in execution. As Berge and Morse describe, any protocol of care requires an understanding of its appropriate application in the population being served. Our translation of any evidence-based protocols requires initial education and continued reminders about the applicability of the treatment for the condition.\n\n【34】**Bias.** The results also exemplify 2 biases that affect clinical outcomes. The first bias is the stereotyping by clinicians of patients with an alcohol use disorder. Clinically, this bias leads to patients who no longer drink but have a history of alcohol problems being stigmatized (once guilty, forever guilty). This bias also contributes to clinicians' belief that they can identify who uses alcohol without standard screening of or obtaining history for all patients, contributing to underidentification of alcohol use problems.\n\n【35】The second bias, the self-serving attributional bias\n\n【36】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【37】*   Mezulis AH\n*   Abramson LY\n*   Hyde JS\n*   Hankin BL\n\n【38】Is there a universal positivity bias in attributions? A meta-analytic review of individual, developmental, and cultural differences in the self-serving attributional bias.\n\n【39】_Psychol Bull._ 2004; 130 : 711-747\n\n【40】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (823)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【41】is a universal positivity bias. Effectively, people take more credit for successes than failures. In medicine, this often is expressed by “not in my practice,” in which clinicians believe that poor quality of care is not an issue in their practice, but is in others. Actual measurement and review of results, which in this research study were not flattering, are absolutely critical in identifying problems with quality of care and improving clinical practice. Unfortunately, I expect this bias will be reflected in those who have read the article by attributing the problems found to interspecialty and interhospital differences in care. The real lesson from the article by Hecksel et al is the need for developing improved and sustainable systems of care that get the basics of health care right all the time for everyone. Being able to identify whether a patient has an alcohol problem is an essential skill for all clinicians.\n\n【42】**Systems of Care.** We must effectively translate evidence from research into clinical practice and improve quality of care for chronic conditions. The research by Hecksel et al points out the practical difficulties in using this strategy. The need for translating a standardized alcohol withdrawal protocol into practice was based on larger national health care changes that provide a context for some of the current difficulties in the treatment of alcohol use disorders, specifically AWS.\n\n【43】In 1989, Hayashida et al\n\n【44】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【45】*   Hayashida M\n*   Alterman AI\n*   McLellan AT\n*   et al.\n\n【46】Comparative effectiveness and costs of inpatient and outpatient detoxification of patients with mild-to-moderate alcohol withdrawal syndrome.\n\n【47】_N Engl J Med._ 1989; 320 : 358-365\n\n【48】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (207)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【49】reported results from a randomized controlled trial of outpatient vs inpatient alcohol detoxification. The evidence from this trial and subsequent trials showed outcomes to be essentially the same in patients with mild to moderate AWS who received outpatient vs inpatient treatment. Patients with severe AWS required inpatient medical monitoring. More powerfully, however, the cost of outpatient treatment of AWS ranged from $175 to $388 vs $3319 to $3665 for inpatient treatment. Policy then followed research findings in the late 1990s, with the now Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services no longer reimbursing psychiatric hospitals for AWS treatment. Psychiatric hospital beds are consistently among the most expensive beds in the hospital because of their need for staffing and close monitoring of patients. This loss of reimbursement led to increased pressure on general hospitals to provide treatment of AWS.\n\n【50】Unfortunately, this change in reimbursement was not accompanied by any type of planned integration of care for those who might have been treated previously for mild to moderate AWS in other settings. Like deinstitutionalization for those with severe mental illness with its failed promises of increased support for closer outpatient follow-up, implementation of systematic delivery of outpatient detoxification has been slow and inconsistent across the United States. Often, improvement has been driven by pressures on hospitals, emergency departments, detoxification centers, the police, and local government, with the patient caught in the middle.\n\n【51】Although I strongly support the editorialists' call for more substance abuse treatment specialists, this is not the point of the article by Hecksel et al. Their article points out the need for improved identification and treatment of alcohol use disorders. If the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services increased reimbursement to clinicians, giving them the incentive to systematically identify alcohol use problems with the AUDIT-C and laboratory screening, the quality of care for those with alcohol use disorders would likely improve.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "8e66bd04-64db-4882-b1b6-7410bc4b4e87", "title": "In the Limelight: August 2023", "text": "【0】In the Limelight: August 2023\nThis month’s feature highlights three articles that appear in the current issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ . These articles are also featured on the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings’_ YouTube Channel ( https://youtu.be/BPQzVkrjiNA ).\n\n【1】Harnessing Medical Knowledge in the Provision of Patient Care: An Institutional Approach\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【2】The current age of medical practice is privileged by the burgeoning of knowledge across the broad landscape of general medicine and its subspecialties, all of which have led to improved outcomes in patient care. This remarkable and encompassing advance, ironically, introduces its own unique challenge in that practice guidelines and standards of care now evolve relatively rapidly, thereby rendering more difficult the expeditious harnessing and discerning culling of relevant and up-to-date medical knowledge that, importantly, speaks directly to patient care. The Knowledge Management Program (KMP) was developed at Mayo Clinic to assist the clinician in this regard, and in the current issue of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , Nishimura et al masterfully place in perspective the development, broad outlines, and contributions of the KMP. Mayo Clinic, an academic medical center that cohesively integrates large multispecialty group practices, emphasizes teamwork – indeed, one of Mayo Clinic’s eight value statements - in the provision of patient care by its clinicians. Through its cornerstone program, the AskMayoExpert (AME), KMP enables physicians at Mayo Clinic to draw upon the expertise of their physician colleagues. AME is commonly used by the majority of Mayo Clinic clinicians, provides succinct Mayo-vetted “knowledge bytes” on clinical issues and diseases that are epitomized by their ready applicability to patient management; it provides for the user information under the rubrics clinical answers, guidelines and resources, patient education, and available clinical trials, and it affords access to experts for further consultation. A complementary KMP product is the Mayo Expert Decision Advisor (MEDA) which integrates Mayo-vetted knowledge with patient data on the Electronic Health Record, extracting and collating patient data relevant to the clinical issue/disease, and adding resources and tools that interpret and synthesize such information in the manner an expert clinician would. A salient intent of the MEDA is to mitigate the cognitive burden on clinicians and improve their efficiency in and their fulfillment with patient care. Dr Samuel Johnson, the celebrated 18 <sup>th </sup> century lexicographer and man of letters, wrote: “Knowledge is of two kinds; we know a subject ourselves or we know where we can find information on it.” We can add a third to Dr Johnson’s duo - we know how to glean, prioritize, and process relevant information. Mayo Clinic’s KMP exemplifies this third kind of knowledge as it applies to patient care. Dr Nishimura and colleagues are to be warmly commended for highlighting these clinically innovative and vital knowledge management programs.\n\n【3】Nishimura RA, Shellum JL, Anderson J-R, Blackmon S, Leibovich BC. Knowledge management in an academic medical center: providing clinical knowledge at the point of care. _Mayo Clin Proc_ . 2023;98(8): 1131-1136. doi.org/10.016/j.mayocp.2023.02.022\n\n【4】Primary Aldosteronism: Insufficiently Considered and Inadequately Treated\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The prevalence of hypertension in adults is now approaching 50% of the US population, and as many as 20% of hypertensive adults may have underlying primary aldosteronism (PA). PA is typified by inappropriately increased, renin-independent production of aldosterone wherein renin levels are suppressed, and increased aldosterone production is generally driven either by an adrenal adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia. Compared with patients with essential hypertension, patients with PA are at an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (including atrial fibrillation and stroke), kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, and a diminished quality of life. In their Concise Review for the Clinician, Dogra et al emphasize the importance of excluding PA in patients with hypertension, as effective treatment of PA may obviate the need for or simplify antihypertensive therapy as well reduce the complications of PA. The authors address the application and interpretation of screening tests for PA such as the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio; attention is given to conditions under which this ratio is measured and to those antihypertensive therapies \\[such as drugs that interrupt the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), β-adrenergic blockers, diuretics, and others\\] that can influence this ratio. An important consideration is that these medications are more likely to cause a false-negative test, and quite unlikely to cause a false-positive test. Screening generally begins with measuring the plasma aldosterone-to-renin ratio without first altering antihypertensive therapy, and if a negative test result is obtained and the clinical suspicion persists that PA exists, the authors suggest an approach of replacing the drugs that do affect the RAAS with those unlikely to do so. Confirmatory tests that demonstrate the lack of suppressibility of aldosterone are discussed, and these include an oral salt load, intravenous saline, and administering captopril or fludrocortisone. Determining whether PA arises from an adrenal adenoma or bilateral hyperplasia proceeds with adrenal computed tomography, and adrenal venous sampling. Unilateral laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice for a functional unilateral adrenal adenoma, and for patients in whom such surgical intervention is not feasible or those with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, medical management is indicated. The authors address the use of nonselective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist (spironolactone), selective MR antagonist (eplerenone), and the novel, nonsteroidal MR antagonist (finerenone). This superb concise review underscores the need to consider PA as a potential underlying cause for hypertension, clarifies and streamlines the needed diagnostic steps, highlights salient aspects of surgical and medical management, and concludes with a summary of the gratifying outcomes that can be achieved when PA is effectively treated.\n\n【6】Dogra P, Bancos I, Young WF Jr. Primary aldosteronism – a pragmatic approach to diagnosis and management. _Mayo Clin Proc_ . 2023;98(8):1207-1215. doi.org/10.016/j.mayocp.2023.04.023\n\n【7】Cardiovascular Risk and Phenotypes in Type 2 Diabetes\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a dominant cause of morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Xue et al questioned whether specific subtypes exist in T2D and the extent to which these subtypes associate with the risk for incident CVD. Their analysis involved the UK Biobank and the _All of Us_ research program. The UK Biobank is a prospective cohort of more than 0.5 million participants in the United Kingdom that collected data pertaining to their health and disease and undertaken between 2006 and 2010. The _All of Us_ cohort was initiated in 2018 in the United States with the intent to collect data on 1 million participants of diverse backgrounds regarding their health, disease, and genetics. Xue et al utilized a novel clustering algorithm that incorporated such variables as the age at which T2D occurred, BMI, HbA <sub>1c </sub> , and eGFR. Their results obtained from the UK Biobank and validated in the _All of Us_ cohort reveal 5 phenotypically distinct subtypes - Cluster 1: Early onset T2D; Cluster 2: Late onset T2D; Cluster 3: T2D with severe obesity; Cluster 4: T2D with poor glycemic control; and Cluster 5: T2D with poor kidney function. Associations with CVD varied depending upon the specific cluster. Compared with Cluster 1, the risk for CVD was highest for Cluster 5 (poor renal function), followed by Cluster 4 (poor glycemic control) and Cluster 3 (severe obesity), with such risks higher but not statistically so for Cluster 2 (late onset T2D). These findings underscore several considerations. First, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for CVD in general and indeed is equivalent to other risk factors such as diabetes or prior myocardial infarction; the combination of both CKD and T2D thus synergizes in driving the risks for CVD in Cluster 5. The non-significantly differing risks of CVD in Clusters 1 and 2 may reflect the countervailing and offsetting effects of younger age (a protective effect) and duration of T2D (an exacerbatory factor) for CVD. Finally, as pointed out by Xue et al, these findings are germane to the notion of precision prevention wherein preventive approaches recognize the heterogeneity of phenotypes in T2D. As for so many disease processes, T2D, in its manifestations and complications, is characterized, not by homogeneity, but by heterogeneity.\n\n【9】Xue Q, Li X, Wang X, Ma H, Heianza Y, Qi L.

Seventy-five patients died during follow-up. Six-month survival was 57%. Lack of surgical debridement was associated with insignificantly lower 6-month survival (hazard ratio \\[HR\\]=1.99; 95% CI, 0.96-4.15; _P_ \\=.07) and significantly poorer survival for the entire duration of follow-up (HR=1.98; 95% CI, 1.15-3.41; _P_ \\=.01), which was most pronounced in stage 5 or 5D CKD (HR=1.91; 95% CI, 1.03-3.56; _P_ \\=.04).

Genetic testing can help determine which family members have the disorder and require sur-veillance endoscopy. Astute physicians may detect unsuspected FAP in patients with extraintestinal manifestations such as hard or soft cutaneous tumors. Colectomy will prevent cancer but is often necessary before the patient is 20 years old. Postoperative lifelong surveillance is indicated to screen for associated duodenal, thyroid, and rectal or ileal neoplasms. Attenuated FAP variants are less typical and may be confused with other types of familial colorectal neoplasia. Chemoprevention, regression, and other treatment strategies are being developed to improve the management of extracolonic neoplasms and desmoid tumors. A better understanding of the natural history of these FAP-associated AP-associated phenomena will facilitate the rational selection of interventions.

The overall age- and sex-adjusted incidence rate increased from 8.6 (95% CI, 3.9 to 13.3) per 100,000 person-years in 1970-1979 to 99.1 (95% CI, 89.5 to 108.7) per 100,000 person-years in 2011-2020 (11.6-fold increase). There was a 52.1-fold increase in women and a 6.3-fold increase in men between these 2 periods. In recent years (2005-2009 vs 2015-2020), the incidence has stabilized in men (1.01-fold increase; _P_ \\=.96) and continues to significantly increase in women (1.5-fold increase; _P_ \\=.002). Among 659 patients with invasive melanoma, 43 deaths were due to melanoma, and male sex was significantly associated with an increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.45 to 6.00).

Multivariable logistic regression models were performed to examine the association between unit CCI score (scale) and in-hospital outcomes (major adverse cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events \\[MACCE\\]: composite of all-cause mortality, acute ischemic stroke, thoracic and cardiac complications, and device-related complications; and MACCE individual components).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 474,475 CIED procedures, the distribution of CCI score was as follows: CCI=0 (17.7%), CCI=1 (21.8%), CCI=2 (18.7%), and CCI=3+ (41.8%). Charlson comorbidity index score was associated with increased odds ratios of MACCE (1.10; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.11), all-cause mortality (1.23; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.25), and acute stroke (1.45; 95% CI, 1.44 to 1.46). This finding was consistent across all CIED groups except the cardiac resynchronization therapy groups in which CCI was not associated with increased risk of mortality. A higher CCI score was not associated with increased odds of procedural (thoracic and cardiac) and device-related complications.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In a nationwide cohort of CIED procedures, higher comorbidity burden as measured by CCI score was associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality and acute ischemic stroke, but not procedure-related (thoracic and cardiac) or device-related complications. Objective assessment of comorbidity burden is important to risk-stratify patients undergoing CIED implantation for better prognostication of their in-hospital survival.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CCI ( Charlson comorbidity index ), CIED ( cardiac implantable electronic device ), CRT ( cardiac resynchronization therapy ), ICD ( implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ), MACCE ( major adverse cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events ), PPM ( permanent pacemaker ), OR ( odds ratio )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

In mid-2001, follow-up data were collected about the factors that physicians described as motivating in their work. We conducted this study to understand the differences in motivators between clinician-educators and clinician-investigators and between male and female physicians, as well as to validate a previously used instrument developed to assess motivation and occupational values.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Of 183 physicians monitored, 144 (79%) responded to an interim follow-up questionnaire. Factor analysis revealed that physicians' occupational motivators could be grouped statistically into 3 factors: self-expression, helping others, and extrinsic rewards. Compared with clinician-educators, clinician-investigators were more motivated in their current work by having the ability to express themselves (composite factor score, 4.30 vs 3.84; _P_ <.001). Clinician-investigators also rated 4 of the 6 items within the factor of self-expression as being significantly stronger motivators for them than did the clinician-educators. Compared with male physicians, female physicians indicated they were more motivated by helping others (composite factor score, 4.18 vs 3.89; _P_ \\=.03).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSIONS\n\n【7】Factors that motivate physicians appear to be different for clinician-investigators and clinician-educators as well as for male and female physicians.

One specific component of reentry that remains particularly contentious is the use of pharmacotherapeutics, specifically buprenorphine, as opioid substitution therapy for health care professionals who wish to return to clinical work. Because health care professionals are typically engaged in safety-sensitive work with considerable consequences when errors occur, abstinence-based recovery should be recommended until studies demonstrate that it is safe to allow this population to practice while undergoing opioid substitution therapy.\n\n【2】The incidence of drug diversion among health care professionals (HCPs) as indicated by referral to treatment centers has been reported to be between 1% and 2%,\n\n【3】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【4】*   Booth J.V.\n*   Grossman D.\n*   Moore J.\n*   et al.\n\n【5】Substance abuse among physicians: a survey of academic anesthesiology programs.\n\n【6】_Anesth Analg._ 2002; 95 : 1024-1030\n\n【7】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (102)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【8】but estimates based on anonymous self-report suggest the actual number may be as high as 10%,\n\n【9】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【10】*   Bell D.M.\n*   McDonough J.P.\n*   Ellison J.S.\n*   Fitzhugh E.C.\n\n【11】Controlled drug misuse by certified registered nurse anesthetists.\n\n【12】_AANA J._ 1999; 67 : 133-140\n\n【13】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【14】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【15】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【16】Bell DM.

Current recommendations for reentry are based on collective expert opinion with little empirical data.\n\n【25】For HCPs in recovery from opioid abuse, the use of pharmacotherapeutics, such as methadone and buprenorphine, is particularly controversial, as indicated by the difficulty encountered while attempting to obtain information regarding individual state policy. Some states allow reentry of HCPs undergoing buprenorphine maintenance therapy; others are adamant that reentry remain strictly forbidden. Some do not have any official policy, whereas others take a “hands-off” approach and allow the individual's addiction counselor to make the decision. Several states have demonstrated reluctance to share their policies.\n\n【26】In this article, we review the pharmacology of buprenorphine, summarize reports of problems associated with its use in the general population, and report a survey of individual states' views on whether opioid-abusing HCPs can return to work vis-à-vis use of buprenorphine as a part of a treatment program.\n\n【27】Buprenorphine\n-------------\n\n【28】### Intended Uses\n\n【29】Buprenorphine is a semisynthetic, partial μ-opioid agonist and κ-receptor antagonist that is currently used for analgesia and to treat opioid dependence.\n\n【30】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【31】*   Messinis L.\n*   Epameinondas L.\n*   Andrian V.\n*   et al.\n\n【32】Neuropsychological functioning in buprenorphine maintained patients versus abstinent heroin abusers on naltrexone hydrochloride therapy.\n\n【33】_Hum Psychopharmacol._ 2009; 24 : 524-531\n\n【34】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (29)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【35】The use of buprenorphine as treatment for opioid dependence was first approved in France in 1995, and it currently is approved for such use in 44 countries worldwide.\n\n【36】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【37】*   Mintzer M.Z.\n\n【38】Effects of opioid pharmacotherapy on psychomotor and cognitive performance: a review of human laboratory studies of methadone and buprenorphine.\n\n【39】_Heroin Addict Relat Clin Probl._ 2007; 9 : 5-24\n\n【40】*   Google Scholar\n\n【41】Compared with full μ-agonists, it is believed that buprenorphine has a safer pharmacodynamic profile because of its slow dissociation from μ-receptors and less respiratory depression.\n\n【42】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【43】*   Messinis L.\n*   Epameinondas L.\n*   Andrian V.\n*   et al.\n\n【44】Neuropsychological functioning in buprenorphine maintained patients versus abstinent heroin abusers on naltrexone hydrochloride therapy.\n\n【45】_Hum Psychopharmacol._ 2009; 24 : 524-531\n\n【46】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (29)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【47】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【48】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【49】*   Rapeli P.\n*   Fabritius C.\n*   Alho H.\n*   Salaspuro M.\n*   Wahlbeck K.\n*   Kalska H.\n\n【50】Methadone vs. buprenorphine/naloxone during early opioid substitution treatment: a naturalistic comparison of cognitive performance relative to healthy controls.\n\n【51】_BMC Clin Pharmacol._ 2007; 7 : 1-10\n\n【52】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【53】This slow dissociation allows for less frequent dosing but can make detoxification from the drug difficult.\n\n【54】A limited number of approaches are available for managing and treating drug abuse, namely, a harm reduction and damage control model or an abstinence-based model. Not all addicted individuals necessarily adhere to an abstinence-based model, so the treatment provider needs to consider the risks vs benefits of a harm reduction model (eg, the risks to the addicted HCP or their patients of spreading blood-borne pathogens such as human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis via infected syringes) and decide which treatment modality will be the most efficacious for the individual.\n\n【55】### Effects and Adverse Effects\n\n【56】Despite its partial μ-agonist qualities, buprenorphine still induces the same physiologic responses as full μ-agonists, including cognitive and psychomotor impairment, memory deficits, miosis, respiratory depression, decreased gastrointestinal motility and urinary retention, and nausea.

Several studies have addressed the abuse potential of buprenorphine specifically. After reports of patients crushing buprenorphine pills and administering them parenterally, the oral tablets were manufactured in a 4:1 ratio of buprenorphine with naloxone (a full μ-antagonist; Suboxone). Naloxone (Narcan), the antidote for acute opiate overdose, is a full antagonist capable of reversing all μ-receptor activity. The naloxone is not absorbed systemically when buprenorphine with naloxone is taken orally as intended, but intravenous administration can precipitate withdrawal in dependent individuals and will prevent the euphoria associated with pure buprenorphine.\n\n【93】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【94】Bell DM.

Described methods of drug diversion include hiding the oral preparation in a piece of gum or surreptitiously removing it from the mouth when buprenorphine is administered in a monitored setting. Most patients initially denied diversion when confronted, but admitted reasons for diversion included the following: too high a dose, desire to stockpile the drug to manage withdrawal, desire not to take buprenorphine, fear of greater addiction, fear of buprenorphine withdrawal, and fear of precipitated withdrawal. Other reasons included intent to divert the medication to a friend or other person or plans to inject the medication at a later time.

Maintaining a balance between preservation of these resources and maintenance of patient and public safety, these professional health programs (PHPs) offer an alternative to outright suspension or revocation of the license to practice, provided the professional complies with the rehabilitation contract and remains in recovery. Voluntary enrollment in these programs temporarily prevents action by the state licensing board and allows for eventual return to clinical practice. However, a number of HCPs are participating in PHPs without the knowledge of the licensure board. These individuals are either self-referred or referred to PHPs by hospitals, practices, treatment centers, or others. Although these individuals are subject to the same terms imposed on participants referred as part of an alternative to discipline program, the state board of medicine or nursing does not necessarily have knowledge of their status unless reported by the PHP.\n\n【206】We inquired of the 51 physician programs in the United States what their stance is concerning returning an HCP to the workplace while the HCP is undergoing buprenorphine maintenance therapy. Fully 25 remained unavailable for comment despite our multiple attempts to contact them, 2 programs replied that they were unwilling to discuss this issue, and 1 program director “felt uncomfortable” revealing the state's practice. The nursing programs were a little more cooperative, although 16 of 51 state programs still remained unavailable for comment on this issue. Table 2 summarizes the individual physician and nursing policies by state.\n\n【207】TABLE 2 State Policies Regarding Reentry of HCPs Undergoing Buprenorphine Maintenance Therapy\n\n| State | PHPs and/or SBOM policy | Nursing and CRNAs alternative to discipline and/or SBON policy |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Alabama | No;

Many studies compared performance with buprenorphine vs methadone, clearly showing that although buprenorphine causes less impairment, it still causes impairment. Unfortunately, evidence is lacking in the specific population of HCPs treated with this medication. Studies need to be conducted that evaluate participants' ability to perform tasks specific to those required of HCPs while undergoing buprenorphine therapy. These studies should involve standardized patients or operating room simulation, using realistic scenarios that require rapid analysis and action, complex decision making, eye-hand coordination, and fine motor skills.\n\n【213】Considerations of damage control and harm reduction are appropriately influential when prescribing pharmacotherapeutic adjuncts in a comprehensive program of recovery. For example, if the only way for a heroin addict to maintain abstinence is to become dependent on methadone or buprenorphine, the risk-benefit ratio may be justified. From an epidemiologic standpoint, dependence on these other medications can reduce the risk of human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis, and other complications related to intravenous drug use. These harm-reducing measures multiply in heroin-abusing populations that are known to share needles, but they hardly apply to the population of addicted HCPs because these people typically have access to sterile needles and syringes, thus reducing that risk exponentially.\n\n【214】The effect of abstinence-based recovery has implications apart from the public health and safety considerations. The improved quality of life for the professional under this model of treatment further justifies the use of the abstinence model specifically in HCPs, and the literature suggests that the success rate of PHPs is much higher than in other populations.\n\n【215】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【216】*   McLellan A.T.\n*   Skipper G.S.\n*   Campbell M.\n*   DuPont R.L.\n\n【217】Five year outcomes in a cohort study of physicians treated for substance use disorders in the United States.\n\n【218】_BMJ._ 2008; 337 ( 4 ) : a2038\n\n【219】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (196)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【220】This offers another argument against use of buprenorphine in HCPs and one that may be more persuasive to addicted professionals and others who are considering how to get them needed help.\n\n【221】Abstinence from all potentially addictive drugs remains the criterion standard for HCPs in recovery. Most PHPs that use an abstinence-based model for physicians in recovery report success rates far in excess of other programs.\n\n【222】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【223】*   DuPont R.L.\n*   McLellan A.T.\n*   White W.L.\n*   Merlo L.J.\n*   Gold M.S.\n\n【224】Setting the standard for recovery: Physicians' Health Programs.\n\n【225】_J Subst Abuse Treat._ 2009; 36 : 159-171\n\n【226】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (106)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【227】There is a long history of success using this model, and the most recent data reported only 22% of physicians testing positive for drugs of abuse at any time during their 5-year monitoring contract and fully 71% remaining licensed and employed 5 years after their initial treatment.\n\n【228】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【229】*   DuPont R.L.\n*   McLellan A.T.\n*   Carr G.\n*   Gendel M.\n*   Skipper G.E.\n\n【230】How are addicted physicians treated? a national survey of Physician Health Programs.\n\n【231】_J Subst Abuse Treat._ 2009; 37 : 1-7\n\n【232】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (123)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【233】In certain situations, potentially addictive drugs can and should be used when the benefit outweighs the risk, but in most of these cases, the situation is extreme and generally time limited. In the case of HCPs in early recovery who are not working clinically, patient safety is not compromised, but the longer-term use of these potentially addictive medications is problematic. These medications can interfere with mandated drug testing and increase the liability carried by the HCP and employer should there be a bad patient outcome. The inability to remain abstinent is often associated with multiple relapses. Although these medications can be widely used to help retain people in the detoxification phase of treatment, maintenance is another matter and indicates severe difficulty with maintaining recovery. More important, these drugs may actually be “psychotoxic” to those in recovery, and inability to remain abstinent without opioid maintenance therapy may be a potential predictor of increased risk for relapse (Mark Broadhead, MD, medical director of the Idaho Physician Health Program, oral communication, February 24, 2011).\n\n【234】The real possibility of relapse once recovering HCPs have returned to clinical practice has a number of implications for the health and safety of the HCPs and their patients. Because the risk of relapse and death is highest during the first year of sobriety and decreases over time, it seems reasonable that the HCP in recovery should spend some time away from clinical practice before returning to work. The appropriate length away from clinical practice after discharge from the initial inpatient treatment facility has not been determined. Most nursing programs require a period away from clinical practice, ranging from a few months to a year or more, but this practice is not standardized and varies from state to state. Physician programs are equally varied, and although recommendations suggesting a minimum of 1 year have been made,\n\n【235】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【236】*   Bryson E.O.\n*   Levine A.I.\n\n【237】One approach to the return to residency for anesthesia residents recovering from opioid addiction.\n\n【238】_J Clin Anesth._ 2008; 20 : 397-400\n\n【239】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (20)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【240】there is still no consensus.\n\n【241】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【242】*   Bryson E.O.\n\n【243】Should residents in recovery from treatment for substance abuse be allowed to return to anesthesia residency training? the results of a survey.\n\n【244】_J Clin Anesth._ 2009; 27 : 508-513\n\n【245】*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (12)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【246】When a formerly opioid-dependent HCP who is maintained with a full μ-opioid antagonist (naltrexone) returns to clinical practice, it undeniably strengthens the safety net. Conversely, if a reentrant is taking a partial μ-agonist and relapses on a very potent full μ-agonist, such as fentanyl, it is reasonable to assume that this would precipitate an overdose.\n\n【247】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【248】Opioid-addicted HCPs are masters of drug diversion. Education does not grant anybody immunity from developing addiction, and in this population, intelligence can be used to cleverly circumvent narcotic accountability and drug substitution. When considering all of the aforementioned issues with buprenorphine diversion, it does not seem reasonable to prescribe this medication to an HCP with a history of opioid addiction. After carefully considering the evidence, we believe that opioid-substitution therapy with buprenorphine is not a reasonable choice for this particular patient population. HCPs are engaged in safety-sensitive work that requires vigilance and full cognitive function. We therefore recommend abstinence-based recovery until studies with this specific HCP population performed in a simulated health care environment document that highly safety-sensitive tasks can be performed without deterioration in performance.\n\n【249】Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------\n\n【250】*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI2OTI1MGY3MTA3OWQ4MjgyYzc4YWYyNmQzNzBkZDQ2OCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDIzNTY5fQ.P4bFJmbFIHw2XmHpRARiMH8aYMUbvChZyqL0on0GvtaXt7vLK8Mwq5UttfZZUHV39scyPxWeS-YSfhKbV25hmLlolbsO8Nn1WoJ91lBsggZX4\\_iagw\\_U0EMt9LpK3crbm10F3bP3BnzQNHGDQJtM9TDa-bbo8smjD-Qeps2wJ1f1nzYbBOf5lRA-MnGJ7CjTG7vEbjR2hKjQjj\\_zMxuB1gQulPc7\\_soIwt4sUVux-qjeonhUdOar61OeQ8YjWAcqEaniYX9qU9XARdzN1Pzzn0iA\\_N8CH8ECKw-V\\_YS54NVkbCYo\\_NRcktXbMcZIuP9ae9I7PpcnaBYF0dw\\_etvvEg\n    \n    Download .mp4 (15.63 MB)\n    \n    Help with .mp4 files\n    \n    Video 1\n    \n    Author Interview Video", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Two days earlier, during an evening meal, he developed a severe left-sided headache that lasted several hours and forced him to bed; he was afebrile and had no other neurologic symptoms. He had “migraines” in the past that occurred only once a year. He also had frequent, less severe headaches that were controlled with aspirin. He suspected that the current headache was a migraine. On the evening of onset of the headache, he was examined at his local emergency department; he was afebrile and had no focal neurologic findings. Findings on a computed tomographic (CT) scan without contrast were normal. He was treated with ketorolac methamine, hydroxyzine, and sumatriptan and discharged.\n\n【1】The next morning, the patient's headache had not resolved. His temperature was 38.6°C, and his physician prescribed ceftriaxone. Throughout the rest of the day, his headache did not improve. Family members noted that the patient appeared “confused.” The next morning, 2 days after onset of the headache, the patient's family brought him to our emergency department because of worsening confusion, disorientation, and unsteadiness when walking.\n\n【2】A general examination revealed an athletic man in no acute distress. He was afebrile, and vital signs were normal. He was drowsy and inattentive; neglect of his right hemispace was apparent. He had nonfluent aphasia with poor naming and repetition and followed only simple 1-step commands. The patient was able to move all 4 extremities spontaneously, although he moved his right arm and leg less than his left arm and leg. A pronation drift of the outstretched right upper extremity was evident. Reflexes were symmetrical, and the plantar responses were flexor. No nuchal rigidity was noted. A complete blood cell count was unremarkable, and no leukocytosis was present.\n\n【3】*   1.\n    \n    **_Which one of the following diagnoses is most likely in this patient?_**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        _Encephalitis_\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        _Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)_\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        _Meningitis_\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        _Migraine with prolonged aura_\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        _Seizure_\n        \n    \n\n【4】Headache, altered level of consciousness, and confusion are consistent with each of these diagnoses.

A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination to search for xanthochromia, the breakdown product of hemoglobin, is usually indicated to rule out SAH when the index of suspicion is high and findings on a CT scan are normal.\n\n【17】Meningitis, regardless of the cause, typically presents with fever, headache, altered level of consciousness (less common with aseptic viral meningitis), nuchal rigidity, nausea, and vomiting. The absence of meningeal irritation and the lack of persistent fever make this possibility less likely. Furthermore, meningitis is associated with focal neurologic findings in only 15% of patients. Therefore, meningitis is unlikely but is possible.\n\n【18】Migraine with prolonged aura refers to a migraine symptom complex accompanied by neurologic deficits that persist for more than 1 hour but fewer than 7 days. Complicated, hemiplegic, ophthalmic, hemisensory, aphasic, basilar, and confusional migraine are all part of the migraine with aura category according to the current International Headache Society classification system; however, some of these disorders are clinically distinct, and the underlying genetic basis has been established for others. A neurologic deficit secondary to migraine is a diagnosis of exclusion. The following entities should also be ruled out: head trauma, vascular and nonvascular disorders, substance withdrawal, noncephalic infection, metabolic disorder, and disorders of the cranium, neck, eyes, nose, sinuses, teeth, and mouth.\n\n【19】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【20】*   Olesen J\n*   Lipton RB\n\n【21】Migraine classification and diagnosis: International Headache Society criteria.\n\n【22】_Neurology._ 1994; 44 : S6-S10\n\n【23】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【24】Migraine would not explain the patient's fever, but the fever did not persist and was absent when he was evaluated at our emergency department. At this point, migraine with prolonged aura should be kept in the differential diagnosis, although encephalitis seems more likely.\n\n【25】No tonic-clonic seizures were witnessed despite close observation of the patient. While postictal confusion may be associated with focal findings that mimic acute encephalopathy or encephalitis, this confusional state usually recedes over several hours. Possibly, this patient had non-convulsive status epilepticus, but it is atypical for status epilepticus to be preceded by headache.\n\n【26】On presentation to our emergency department, the patient was given intravenous acyclovir therapy because of the possibility of herpes encephalitis. Computed tomography, lumbar puncture, and electroencephalography (EEG) were performed. The CT scan suggested subtle effacement of the sulci of the left cerebral hemisphere. Analysis of the CSF revealed the following: opening pressure, 9 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O (reference ranges shown parenthetically) (8-20 cm H <sub>2 </sub> O); total nucleated cells, 1/mL (<5/mL); erythrocytes, 1/mL; protein, 29 mg/dL (14-45 mg/dL); glucose, 76 mg/dL; negative gram stain; and no xanthochromia. The EEG suggested diffuse left hemisphere dysfunction with delta frequency activity but no epileptiform discharges. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation, which included cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and cervical vessels, and magnetic resonance venography (MRV). The MRI scan ( Figure 1 ) showed a diffuse high signal throughout the left cerebral hemispheric gray matter, best seen on the fluid attenuated inversion recovery images, along with widening of the gyri and obliteration of the sulci secondary to lateralized cerebral edema. Findings on MRA and MRV were normal.\n\n【27】*   2.\n    \n    **_Based on the laboratory and neuroimaging findings, which one of the following diagnoses is now most likely in this patient?_**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        _Cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT)_\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        _Acute arterial infarct_\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        _Migraine with prolonged aura_\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        _Encephalitis_\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        _Mitochondrial encephalopathy_\n        \n    \n\n【28】Figure 1 Magnetic resonance fluid attenuated inversion recovery image reveals hyperintensity (arrows) diffusely throughout the cortical gray matter of the left hemisphere. Effacement of the cortical sulci in the left hemisphere is due to edema.\n\n【29】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【30】Often, a clue to the diagnosis of CVT is a hemorrhagic infarct that does not pertain to a single arterial territory or an elevated CSF opening pressure. Thus, CVT is unlikely in our patient. Moreover, CVT is unlikely with normal findings on MRV. In a patient with a unilateral headache and focal neurologic deficit referable to the same hemisphere, a carotid or vertebral dissection leading to arterial infarction should be considered. A major cerebral arterial infarction can produce a similar picture on CT, with hemispheric edema and obliteration of sulci as the earliest findings; however, the MRI appearances in our patient are atypical for an arterial infarct in light of the wide extent of the cortical changes without apparent involvement of the subcortical white matter. The normal findings on MRA of the head and neck vessels make arterial dissection unlikely. Furthermore, although unilateral, the MRI changes do not pertain to the territory of any single major vessel, as would be expected with an embolic or thrombotic cerebral infarction.\n\n【31】Migraine with prolonged aura is a diagnosis of exclusion. Based on the normal findings on CSF analysis and the subtle MRI abnormalities, this is the most likely diagnosis. Similar MRI findings have been reported in patients with migraine with aura.\n\n【32】The extensive involvement of the cortical ribbon over the entire hemisphere is unusual in viral encephalitis. Herpes simplex encephalitis is associated with focal MRI abnormalities, but these abnormalities are usually in the medial temporal structures. The normal CSF results argue against encephalitis.\n\n【33】Mitochondrial encephalopathies are inherited disorders associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial disorders are often associated with myopathy and lactic acidosis. The imaging changes most commonly seen in the brain in patients with MELAS ( _m_ itochondrial _e_ ncephalopathy, _l_ actic _a_ cidosis, and _s_ troke-like episodes) syndrome are multifocal cerebral infarcts, rather than confluent signal changes involving the cortical ribbon of an entire hemisphere.\n\n【34】On further discussion with family members, we discovered that the patient had a history of recurrent events similar to the current episode. At 1 year of age, he fell from a chair, sustaining minor head trauma; a protracted course of emesis required hospitalization for rehydration. At 9 years of age, the patient was hit in the head by a ball; over the course of several hours, he developed headache, nausea, vomiting, and confusion. He was hospitalized for 1 week; during that time, CSF analysis and head CT showed normal findings, but EEG demonstrated diffuse left hemispheric delta activity, suggesting diffuse left hemisphere dysfunction. Over the course of hospitalization, the patient's symptoms resolved completely. At 10 years of age, the patient fell from a tree, sustaining minor head trauma; a severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and confusion developed. An EEG demonstrated right hemispheric delta frequency activity.\n\n【35】A detailed family history revealed that the patient's mother had migraine headaches. A maternal first cousin also had recurrent headaches associated with transient aphasia and motor neurologic deficits requiring hospitalization.\n\n【36】*   3.\n    \n    **_With the information obtained thus far, which one of the following disorders is most likely in this patient?_**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        _Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with sub-cortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)_\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        _MELAS_\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        _Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM)_\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        _Antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome (APLAB)_\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        _Syndrome of headache, neurologic deficit, and CSF lymphocytosis (HaNDL)_\n        \n    \n\n【37】Recurrent migraine is common to CADASIL, MELAS, FHM, HaNDL, and APLAB. The inherited disorders CADASIL and MELAS are consistent with a family history that could be explained by autosomal dominant or mitochondrial inheritance. However, the lack of a progressive neurologic decline in our patient argues against these 2 diseases. In addition, the relatively subtle abnormalities on MRI are not consistent with CADASIL or MELAS. In these conditions, patients ultimately experience dementia. Patients with CADASIL have substantial white matter abnormality on MRI, an abnormality not present in our patient. Characterized by recurrent migraine and hemiplegia, FHM is a genetic disorder, and often there is a strong family history. Results of laboratory and imaging studies are relatively unremarkable, although subtle imaging findings, as in our patient, have been reported. Patients with FHM recover completely from each episode. In our patient, FHM is the most likely diagnosis. His clinical presentation is typical for FHM, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with variable penetrance. Antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome, like MELAS and CADASIL, should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of migraine accompanied by stroke. Our patient's radiological findings were unlike those typically seen in patients with APLAB, which usually show ischemic strokes.

A skin biopsy might be useful in the diagnosis of CADASIL. A superficial temporal artery biopsy may help to confirm an inflammatory vasculopathy.\n\n【47】Based on our patient's symptom complex, the most likely diagnosis is FHM.

Genetic linkage analyses have clarified the pathogenesis of the disease and suggest that it is a calcium channelopathy in a high proportion of cases.\n\n【76】Attacks typically begin in childhood and are frequently precipitated by minor head trauma that leads to alterations in consciousness, ranging from confusion to coma. Hemiparesis is frequently mild, and confusion or aphasia dominates the clinical picture. Recurrent encephalitis is commonly diagnosed. The focal features are a component of the aura and last less than 1 hour to days or weeks before complete resolution. Usually, no sequelae are permanent. However, 20% to 40% of patients with the 19p calcium channel mutation have progressive cerebellar atrophy.\n\n【77】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【78】*   Gardner K\n*   Hoffman EP\n\n【79】Current status of genetic discoveries in migraine: familial hemiplegic migraine and beyond.\n\n【80】_Curr Opin Neurol._ 1998; 11 : 211-216\n\n【81】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (23)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【82】Because of the broad differential diagnosis of acute encephalopathy, FHM can be difficult to diagnose. When confusion punctuated by acute attacks of migraine dominates the clinical picture, other entities to consider are MELAS, CADASIL, and APLAB. This case shows how clinical and radiological assessments, such as MRI with fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences, can distinguish among these entities. Electroencephalography may also be useful in identifying lateralized hemispheric high-voltage, slow-wave activity, but this finding is nonspecific and can be seen in various focal encephalitides. Several patients with FHM have been studied with transcranial Doppler ultrasonography or angiography to assess cerebral blood flow both during and after the headache phase and were found to have unstable cerebrovascular tone with wide rapid fluctuations in cerebral blood flow. Whereas initial phases of vasodilatation are likely responsible for the migrainous headache, vasocon-striction that leads to ischemia is responsible for the subsequent neurologic deficits.\n\n【83】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【84】*   Friberg L\n*   Olsen TS\n*   Roland PE\n*   Lassen NA\n\n【85】Focal ischaemia caused by instability of cerebrovascular tone during attacks of hemiplegic migraine: a regional cerebral blood flow study.\n\n【86】_Brain._ 1987; 110 : 917-934\n\n【87】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (61)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【88】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【89】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【90】*   Pierelli F\n*   Pauri F\n*   Cupini LM\n*   Fiermonte G\n*   Rizzo PA\n\n【91】Transcranial Doppler sonography in familial hemiplegic migraine.\n\n【92】_Cephalalgia._ 1991; 11 : 29-31\n\n【93】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (12)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【94】Once the diagnosis of FHM is established clinically, the mutation status of the proband and other family members can be assessed directly.

Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) causes an inflammatory longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). In 2004, aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) was first reported as a highly specific (>99%) serum diagnostic biomarker of NMOSD, distinguishing it from other disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis). We sought to assess the frequency of AQP4-IgG (and thus NMOSD diagnosis) in LETM with aPL antibodies. We searched Mayo Clinic records (from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 2014) for patients with (1) LETM and (2) aPL or β <sub>2 </sub> \\-glycoprotein I antibodies and (3) a serum sample available. AQP4-IgG was evaluated in the 24 included patients and in 20 controls with aPL antibodies but without myelitis. Seropositivity for AQP4-IgG was confirmed in 11 of 24 patients with LETM (46%), confirming an AQP4-IgG–seropositive NMOSD diagnosis rather than aPL-associated LETM. Six of 11 AQP4-IgG–seropositive patients (54%) were initially diagnosed as having aPL/lupus-associated myelitis. Recurrent LETM was exclusive to AQP4-IgG–seropositive patients ( _P_ \\=.003). Alternative diagnoses assigned to the remaining 13 AQP4-IgG–seronegative patients included idiopathic transverse myelitis (n=5), seronegative NMOSD (n=2), spinal cord infarct attributed to aPL antibodies (n=2), spinal cord sarcoidosis (n=1), varicella-zoster virus myelitis (n=1), postinfectious myelitis (n=1), and multiple sclerosis (n=1). All 20 controls were seronegative for AQP4-IgG. Clotting disorders occurred in 36% of patients (4 of 11) with LETM with both aPL antibodies and AQP4-IgG. AQP4-IgG should be tested in all patients with LETM and aPL antibodies because AQP4-IgG–seropositive NMOSD accounts for almost half of all cases. Clotting disorders are common in patients with LETM with dual positivity for AQP4-IgG and aPL antibodies.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】Ab ( antibody ), aPL ( antiphospholipid ), APS ( antiphospholipid syndrome ), AQP4-IgG ( aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G ), CNS ( central nervous system ), DVT ( deep venous thrombosis ), LETM ( longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis ), MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ), NMOSD ( neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder ), PE ( pulmonary embolism ), SLE ( systemic lupus erythematosus ), STIR ( short tau inversion recovery )\n\n【4】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【5】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【6】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【7】One-time access price info\n\n【8】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【9】### Subscribe:\n\n【10】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【11】Already a print subscriber?

Patients with renal impairment, previous nephrectomy, bilateral or multiple RCCs, metastasis, and familial cancer syndromes were excluded. A total 164 patients in each cohort were matched according to pathological grade, pathological T stage, size of tumor, age, sex, and year of surgery. The Kaplan-Meier method and stratified Cox proportional hazards model were used to estimate and compare overall, cancer-specific, local recurrencefree, and metastasis-free survival and survival free of chronic renal insufficiency. The 2 groups were evaluated for early (≤30 days) complications and proteinuria at last follow-up.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】At last follow-up, 126 RN patients (77%) and 130 NSS patients (79%) were alive with no evidence of disease. There was no significant difference observed between patients who had RN and those who had NSS with respect to overall survival (risk ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval \\[CI\\], 0.52-1.74; _P_ \\=.88) or cancer-specific survival (risk ratio, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.30-5.95; _P_ \\=.71). At 10 years, similar rates of contralateral recurrence (0.9% for RN vs 1% for NSS) and metastasis (4.9% for RN vs 4.3% for NSS) were seen in each group, whereas the rate of ipsilateral local recurrence for patients who underwent RN and NSS was 0.8% and 5.4%, respectively ( _P_ \\=.18). There was no significant difference in the early complications between the RN and NSS groups. However, patients who underwent RN had a significantly higher risk for proteinuria as defined by a protein/osmolality ratio of 0.12 or higher (55.2% vs 34.5%; P=.01). At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of chronic renal insufficiency (creatinine >2.0 mg/dL at least 30 days after surgery) was 22.4% and 11.6%, respectively, for the RN and NSS groups (risk ratio, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.2-11.2; _P_ \\=.01).\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】This retrospective study of patients with unilateral RCC and a normal contralateral kidney suggests that NSS is as effective as RN for the treatment of RCC on long-term follow-up. The increased risk of chronic renal insufficiency and proteinuria after RN supports use of NSS.\n\n【8】CI ( confidence interval ), NSS ( nephron-sparing surgery ), RCC ( renal cell carcinoma ), RN ( radical nephrectomy )\n\n【9】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】One-time access price info\n\n【13】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】### Subscribe:\n\n【15】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】Already a print subscriber?

The calculated fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) was 9.4%.\n\n【11】*   2.\n    \n    **Which _one_ of the following is the _most likely_ etiology of this patient’s AKI?**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        Hypovolemia\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        Benign prostatic hyperplasia\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS)\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        AIN\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        Acute tubular necrosis (ATN)\n        \n    \n\n【12】Hypovolemia can cause prerenal azotemia by decreasing perfusion to the kidneys. Common causes including volume loss such as vomiting, diarrhea, bleeding, or excess insensitive losses yield a low FeNa, possibly below 1%, as the kidneys attempt to retain sodium. Obstructive uropathy secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia is part of the differential diagnosis for a patient with a FeNa of less than 1%; however, the absence of hydronephrosis or decreased urinary output makes it unlikely in our patient. In the context of recent chemotherapy for lymphoma, AKI, electrolyte abnormalities, and increased uric acid level, AKI secondary to TLS is the most likely diagnosis. The mechanism of kidney injury in TLS is multifactorial and involves increased crystallization of uric acid in renal tubules, tubular obstruction from cell sloughing, crystal-independent mechanisms such as uric acid–induced renal vasoconstriction, and calcium-phosphate complex precipitation.\n\n【13】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【14】*   Abu-Alfa A.K.\n*   Younes A.\n\n【15】Tumor lysis syndrome and acute kidney injury: evaluation, prevention, and management.\n\n【16】_Am J Kidney Dis._ 2010; 55 : S1-S13\n\n【17】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (71)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【18】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【19】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【20】*   Howard S.C.\n*   Jones D.P.\n*   Pui C.H.\n\n【21】The tumor lysis syndrome.\n\n【22】_N Engl J Med._ 2011; 364 : 1844-1854\n\n【23】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (577)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【24】Acute interstitial nephritis is classically associated with β-lactam antibiotics and NSAIDs; however, other less recognized medications such as proton pump inhibitors are a leading cause of AIN in the current era.\n\n【25】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【26】*   Härmark L.\n*   van der Wiel H.E.\n*   de Groot M.C.\n*   van Grootheest A.C.\n\n【27】Proton pump inhibitor-induced acute interstitial nephritis.\n\n【28】_Br J Clin Pharmacol._ 2007; 64 : 819-823\n\n【29】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【30】Although present in only 5% of cases, its classic triad consists of rash, fever, and arthralgia.

Our patient had not undergone dietary restrictions or sunlight deprivation that could increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency. Hyperphosphatemia induced by the breakdown of cancer cells precipitates calcium, leading to the formation of calcium-phosphate complexes and subsequent hypocalcemia. The calcium-phosphate deposits may cause tubular obstruction and AKI, as seen in our patient. Celiac disease can induce hypocalcemia by impairing the absorption of vitamin D in the brush border of the duodenum, but in the absence of diarrhea, iron deficiency, or malabsorption, this diagnosis could not be substantiated.\n\n【40】The patient calcium levels remained stable and no neurologic symptoms developed.\n\n【41】*   4.\n    \n    **Which _one_ of the following intravenous fluid preparations should be administered _first_ for the treatment of AKI secondary to TLS?**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        Normal saline\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        Lactated Ringer solution\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        Bicarbonate-based fluids\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        Albumin\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        Half-normal saline\n        \n    \n\n【42】Isotonic normal saline should be used first in the treatment of AKI due to TLS.

Nucleic acids from dead cancer cells are released into the circulation and converted to uric acid, which in turn crystallizes and causes AKI. Allopurinol decreases uric acid production by inhibiting xanthine oxidase but does not affect already existing uric acid. Rasburicase is a urate oxidase enzyme that converts existing uric acid into allantoin, which is 5 to 10 times more soluble in urine than uric acid.\n\n【58】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【59】*   Ueng S.\n\n【60】Rasburicase (Elitek): a novel agent for tumor lysis syndrome.\n\n【61】_Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent)._ 2005; 18 : 275-279\n\n【62】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【63】It is the preferred agent in patients with serum uric acid levels greater than 7.5 mg/dL, such as our patient whose levels reached 18.0 mg/dL. Sevelamer is a phosphate binder that can be used for hyperphosphatemia in end-stage renal disease; however, insufficient evidence exists on its effectiveness in TLS. Although diuretics may be necessary to promote diuresis after aggressive volume expansion, acetazolamide would promote urine alkalinization by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase, which can exacerbate crystal precipitation of calcium phosphate. Sodium bicarbonate is not recommended for the treatment of TLS because alkalinization of the urine can induce the formation of calcium phosphate stones and worsen the kidney injury.\n\n【64】The patient was treated with a single 6-mg dose of rasburicase, and the uric acid level decreased from 18.0 mg/dL to 3.8 mg/dL over approximately 24 hours. The creatinine level increased to a maximum of 5.9 on hospital day 4 but later returned to baseline. Because the patient’s urinary output remained intact and electrolytes stabilized within the normal range, he did not require hemodialysis.\n\n【65】Discussion\n----------\n\n【66】Tumor lysis syndrome is an oncological emergency that can be fatal if not treated promptly and effectively. It is caused by the release of intracellular contents such as electrolytes and nucleotides into the circulation after cancer cells die as a consequence of chemotherapy and/or radiation. This syndrome is associated mainly with soft tissue malignancies with a rapid dividing rate, such as leukemias and lymphomas, and may occur spontaneously before anticancer treatment is administered. However, advanced and metastatic solid tumors can cause TLS as well.\n\n【67】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【68】*   Mirrakhimov A.E.\n*   Ali A.M.\n*   Khan M.\n*   Barbaryan A.\n\n【69】Tumor lysis syndrome in solid tumors: an up to date review of the literature.\n\n【70】_Rare Tumors._ 2014; 6 : 5389\n\n【71】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (94)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【72】Cairo and Bishop\n\n【73】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【74】*   Cairo M.S.\n*   Bishop M.\n\n【75】Tumour lysis syndrome: new therapeutic strategies and classification.\n\n【76】_Br J Haematol._ 2004; 127 : 3-11\n\n【77】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (705)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【78】classified TLS into a laboratory variant and a clinical variant.

This effort combines medicine, aviation, and radio to bring care to the people who live, work, and travel in remote areas of Australia. Established in 1928 and developed on a national basis in the 1930s, the service soon provided not only emergency medical aid to the people of the inland of Australia but also comprehensive health care and community services. In 1957, Australia issued a stamp (Scott No. 305) in honor of the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia. The issuance of this stamp offers an opportunity to honor its founder, the Reverend John Flynn.\n\n【2】John Flynn was born on November 25, 1880, in Moliagul in central Victoria, Australia. His father was a schoolteacher, and John was the youngest of 3 children; his mother had died in childbirth when John was only 3 years old. For several years, John lived with relatives before the family was reunited at Snake Gully (near Ballarat in south central Victoria, about 70 miles northwest of Melbourne). The family later moved to a suburb of Melbourne, where John's father began an unsuccessful business venture.\n\n【3】In 1898, John graduated from secondary school and began teaching. In 1903, when he was residing in Victoria, he decided to become a minister of the Presbyterian Church. In 1907, he began a 4-year course in divinity training at Melbourne University; he graduated in 1910 and was ordained in January 1911.\n\n【4】While preparing for the ministry, Flynn became interested in working in “the outback” (the wild central and northern inland of Australia). In February 1911, he began his work in the outback when he arrived at Beltana in South Australia, about 300 miles north of Adelaide, where medical care was unavailable to the inland residents and travelers. Flynn reported to his church about the conditions in the outback and was appointed head of a new organization, the Australian Inland Mission (AIM). During the next few years, the organization founded several nursing homes and recruited ministers to travel to vast outback parishes by camel or on horseback, visiting communities and households and tending to the people of the inland.\n\n【5】Flynn helped establish bush hospitals and hostels in remote outback regions. In 1903, the first powered air flights had taken place, and by 1918, the airplane was beginning to prove itself as a reliable means of transportation. Flynn saw the potential in the use of the airplane. By 1928, AIM had sufficient funds to establish the Flying Doctor Service, and on May 15, 1928, the Aerial Medical Service was established at Cloncurry in northwestern Queensland. After many years of dreaming, hard work, and planning, the Flying Doctor Service became a reality. The first official flight occurred on May 17, 1928, from Cloncurry to Julia Creek, a distance of about 80 miles. The first flying doctor was Sydney surgeon Kenyon St. Vincent Welch. The trial year (1928) began without a radio network. The Flying Doctor Service relied on telephone links between towns and settlements and on people physically traveling long distances for help. What was needed was a portable, cheap, and reliable 2-way radio with a range of 300 miles. This became a reality in 1929 when the Cloncurry Base radio station became operative.\n\n【6】By 1932, AIM had a network of 10 small hospitals. During this early period, Dr Alan Vickers, a flying doctor, lobbied for a network of flying doctor bases spread across the entire continent of Australia.\n\n【7】In 1934, the Presbyterian Church transferred the work to the Australian Aerial Medical Service, which during the next few years established services across Australia with operational bases at Wyndham (northwestern Western Australia), Kalgoorlie (southern Western Australia), Broken Hill (western New South Wales), Alice Springs (south central Northern Territory), and Meekatharra (Western Australia), along with bases in Charters Towers (eastern Queensland) and Charleville (southern Queensland). In 1942, the service was renamed the “Flying Doctor Service,” and in 1955, the Queen of England granted the use of the Royal prefix.\n\n【8】On May 5, 1951, at the age of 70 years, John Flynn died in Sydney, New South Wales, and was buried near Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, the center of the vast area in which he had worked.\n\n【9】Article info\n------------\n\n【10】### Identification\n\n【11】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/80.1.14\n\n【12】### Copyright\n\n【13】© 2005 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

We support a market-based model with various insurance benefit packages and the ability of individuals to purchase more than the basic insurance plan. That said, a defined basic benefit package would be needed to establish a bench-mark for the amount of government financial subsidy for individuals whom the government believes should receive such assistance. These guidelines will be difficult to establish, and the gains must be weighed against the cost of services. Because the definition of such a plan will likely be contentious, we recommend that it be established by a body that can function in a politically neutral process—just as the Federal Reserve Board changes interest rates in a politically neutral manner.\n\n【1】In addition, a health care system that is based on the principles of a learning organization, as described in our article, could help in determining these benefits. A health care system that would be based on evidence of effectiveness and efficiency could provide benefits that are of value to the population. It would, over time, both delete services that were of minimal patient value and add services that were of patient value.\n\n【2】Article info\n------------\n\n【3】### Identification\n\n【4】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/81.9.1259\n\n【5】### Copyright\n\n【6】© 2006 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

The treatment of acquired angioedema is shaped after that of hereditary angioedema. However, the acquired form is even less prevalent than the hereditary form, precluding large-scale studies. Thus, current experience is mainly based on case reports and case series. It should be kept in mind that acquired angioedema or C1 inhibitor deficiency is immune-mediated. Thus, in contrast to patients with the hereditary form, patients with acquired angioedema may be partially resistant to C1 inhibitor substitution (given as a concentrate or as fresh frozen plasma) because of hypercatabolism. Theoretically, the problem of C1-inhibitor catabolism can be bypassed by products that inhibit the bradykinin pathway. However, to my knowledge, studies on these new agents in acquired C1-inhibitor deficiency are currently nonexistent.\n\n【1】Article info\n------------\n\n【2】### Identification\n\n【3】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/mcp.2009.0625\n\n【4】### Copyright\n\n【5】© 2010 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Warty papules first appeared on his hands 43 years ago, and then gradually scattered over the whole body. The papules enlarged to form large vegetating hyperkeratotic masses ( Figure 1 ). Hand function and life quality was severely impaired. No one else in the patient’s family was similarly affected. Skin biopsy showed hyperkeratosis, thickening of the stratum spinosum, and vacuolated cells with clear, light-blue pale cytoplasm in the upper epidermis.

Rarely, priapism can be a serious adverse effect of antipsychotic medications; virtually all antipsychotic medications have been reported to cause priapism because of their α-adrenergic antagonism.\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】*   Bressler R\n\n【3】Herb-drug interactions: interactions between Ginkgo biloba and prescription medications.\n\n【4】_Geriatrics._ 2005; 60 : 30-33\n\n【5】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【6】_Ginkgo biloba_ is used worldwide as a complementary medicine for its antioxidant and neuro-protective effects. However, its drug interaction with other medications, including antipsychotic agents, should be considered before it is prescribed for any purpose.\n\n【7】**Report of a Case.** A 26-year-old man presented to the emergency department of our hospital with a persistent and painful erection of the penis that had lasted for 4 hours. He had a history of paranoid schizophrenia, for which he was treated with 3 mg/d of risperidone for 3 years. He reported no other chronic illness, recent trauma, or use of drugs. He denied any adverse effects due to antipsychotic therapies. Two weeks before admission, he began taking 160 mg/d of generic _Ginkgo biloba_ for occasional tinnitus.\n\n【8】On arrival at the emergency department, his blood pressure was 150/88 mm Hg; his pulse rate, 94 beats/min; and his temperature, 35.9°C. Findings on physical examination were normal except for a persistent erection of the penis. His hematocrit was 37%, and no dysmorphic red blood cells were noted on microscopic examination. Color flow Doppler sonography of the penis showed a decreased blood flow in the cavernosal arteries. His priapism was refractory to analgesics and ice packing. Blood gas analysis of the aspired cavernous venous blood revealed a pH value of 6.79, a Pco <sub>2 </sub> of 114.9 torr, and undetectable Po <sub>2 </sub> , findings consistent with veno-occlusion (low-flow) priapism. Two hours after corporal irrigation with diluted epinephrine, priapism subsided. The patient was discharged uneventfully and was instructed to discontinue the use of risperidone and _Ginkgo biloba_ . On direct questioning, he reported having no prolonged erection or priapism when he was being treated with risperidone. The 3 mg/d dose of risperidone was resumed without adverse effect. On follow-up at 6 months, he reported normal erections with no further episodes of priapism.\n\n【9】**Discussion.** Priapism has multiple etiologies, including hematologic, neurological, iatrogenic, and pharmacological causes. Drug-induced priapism is usually of the ischemic (low-flow, veno-occlusion) type; arterial (high-flow) priapism is relatively rare and predominantly caused by trauma. An estimated 50% of those who experience drug-induced priapism are taking antipsychotic agents; α-adrenergic antagonism is thought to be the most important underlying mechanism.\n\n【10】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【11】*   Wang CS\n*   Kao WT\n*   Chen CD\n*   Tung YP\n*   Lung FW\n\n【12】Priapism associated with typical and atypical antipsychotic medications.\n\n【13】_Int Clin Psychopharmacol._ 2006; 21 : 245-248\n\n【14】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (26)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【15】Risperidone, an atypical antipsychotic agent used primarily to treat psychosis and schizophrenia, has serotonergic, dopaminergic, and α-adrenergic antagonist properties.

Occurrence of peak flow rates below 5 mL/s was 3.8% (8/209) for combination therapy and 5.7% (12/209) for tamsulosin alone ( _P_ \\=.49).\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】In men with substantial storage symptoms, combination therapy with tamsulosin and extended-release oxybutynin demonstrated greater efficacy than and comparable safety and tolerability to tamsulosin monotherapy.\n\n【8】AE ( adverse event ), AUR ( acute urinary retention ), BPH ( benign prostatic hyperplasia ), BPO ( benign prostatic obstruction ), GRA ( global response assessment ), IPSS ( International Prostate Symptom Score ), ITT ( intention-to-treat ), LOCF ( last observation carried forward ), LUTS ( lower urinary tract symptoms ), OAB ( overactive bladder ), PFR ( peak flow rate ), PVR ( postvoid residual ), QOL ( quality of life ), SPI ( Symptom Problem Index )\n\n【9】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】One-time access price info\n\n【13】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】### Subscribe:\n\n【15】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】Already a print subscriber?

Disagreements between autopsy and antemortem diagnoses were classified as type I or type II errors. A new major diagnosis with potential for directly impacting therapy was considered a type I error. Type II errors included important findings that would not have likely changed therapy.\n\n【4】### Results:\n\n【5】Of 1597 deaths in all ICUs during the study period, autopsies were performed in 527 patients (33%). Autopsy reports were available in 455 patients, of whom 19 (4%) had type I errors and 78 (17%) had type II errors. The most common type I error was cardiac tamponade. There were no significant differences in age, sex, or length of stay in the ICU or hospital among patients with and without diagnostic errors or among patients with type I and II errors. Seventy-eight patients had 81 type II errors.

Clinical and laboratory characteristics and the risk of symptomatic recurrence were compared between stone compositions.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】There were 2961 validated first-time symptomatic kidney stone formers. Stone composition analysis was obtained in 1508 (51%) at the first episode. Stone formers were divided into the following mutually exclusive groups: any brushite (0.9%), any struvite (0.9%), any uric acid (4.8%), and majority calcium oxalate (76%) or majority hydroxyapatite (18%). Stone composition varied with clinical characteristics. A multivariable model had a 69% probability of correctly estimating stone composition but assuming calcium oxalate monohydrate stone was correct 65% of the time. Symptomatic recurrence at 10 years was approximately 50% for brushite, struvite, and uric acid but approximately 30% for calcium oxalate and hydroxyapatite stones ( _P_ <.001). Recurrence was similar across different proportions of calcium oxalate and hydroxyapatite ( _P_ for trend=.10). However, among calcium oxalate stones, 10-year recurrence rate ranged from 38% for 100% calcium oxalate dihydrate to 26% for 100% calcium oxalate monohydrate ( _P_ for trend=.007).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Calcium stones are more common (93.5% of stone formers) than has been previously reported. Although clinical and laboratory factors associate with the stone composition, they are of limited utility for estimating stone composition. Rarer stone compositions are more likely to recur.\n\n【9】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】One-time access price info\n\n【13】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】### Subscribe:\n\n【15】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】Already a print subscriber?

Adults with T2DM but without end-stage renal disease who initiated either SGLT2i or other classes of glucose-lowering medications (o-GLM) were matched using propensity score. The primary outcome was the time course of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) displayed in spline curve. The composite of renal worsening (>40% decline in eGFR) and the development of eGFR<30 mL/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> per minute was evaluated as a secondary outcome. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine the robustness of results.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We compared a matched cohort of 1433 SGLT2i users and 2739 o-GLM users (mean age: 61 years). The eGFR declined over time in both groups during the observation period (median: 17 months; maximum: 54 months), with a slower eGFR slope observed in SGLT2i users. This slower decline was consistently observed across different SGLT2i agents and different baseline eGFR groups. The cumulative incidence of composite renal endpoints was lower in the SGLT2i group with a hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.50-0.98; _P_ \\=.039). Those findings were consistent in sensitivity analyses limited to the period adherent to the initial drug regimen and with a different approach for propensity score calculation.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In a matched cohort of T2DM patients, SGLT2i use was associated with preserved renal function relative to o-GLM use over 2 to 4 years.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】GLM ( glucose-lowering medications ), HbA1c ( hemoglobin A1c ), HCIE ( Health, Clinic and Education Information Evaluation Institute ), IQR ( interquartile ranges ), o-GLM ( other classes of glucose-lowering medications ), PS ( propensity score ), RCTs ( randomized controlled trials ), s-Cr ( serum creatinine ), SGLT2i ( sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor ), T2DM ( type 2 diabetes mellitus )\n\n【11】The renoprotective effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) medications — the latest glucose-lowering medication (GLM) that promotes glucosuria — is an emerging topic in diabetology and nephrology, as well as in clinical practice.\n\n【12】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【13】*   Alicic R.Z.\n*   Johnson E.J.\n*   Tuttle K.R.\n\n【14】SGLT2 inhibition for the prevention and treatment of diabetic kidney disease: a review.\n\n【15】_Am J Kidney Dis._ 2018; 72 : 267-277\n\n【16】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (83)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【17】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【18】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【19】*   Thomas M.C.\n*   Cherney D.Z.I.\n\n【20】The actions of SGLT2 inhibitors on metabolism, renal function and blood pressure.\n\n【21】_Diabetologia._ 2018; 61 : 2098-2107\n\n【22】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (183)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【23】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【24】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【25】*   Heerspink H.J.\n*   Perkins B.A.\n*   Fitchett D.H.\n*   Husain M.\n*   Cherney D.Z.\n\n【26】Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in the treatment of diabetes mellitus: cardiovascular and kidney effects, potential mechanisms, and clinical applications.\n\n【27】_Circulation._ 2016; 134 : 752-772\n\n【28】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (800)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【29】Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have consistently shown that SGLT2i delayed the decline of renal function over 1 to 3 years in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).\n\n【30】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【31】*   Cefalu W.T.\n*   Leiter L.A.\n*   Yoon K.H.\n*   et al.\n\n【32】Efficacy and safety of canagliflozin versus glimepiride in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin (CANTATA-SU): 52 week results from a randomised, double-blind, phase 3 non-inferiority trial.\n\n【33】_Lancet._ 2013; 382 : 941-950\n\n【34】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (605)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【35】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【36】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【37】*   Kohan D.E.\n*   Fioretto P.\n*   Tang W.\n*   List J.F.\n\n【38】Long-term study of patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment shows that dapagliflozin reduces weight and blood pressure but does not improve glycemic control.\n\n【39】_Kidney Int._ 2014; 85 : 962-971\n\n【40】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (521)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【41】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【42】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【43】*   Wanner C.\n*   Heerspink H.J.L.\n*   Zinman B.\n*   et al.\n\n【44】Empagliflozin and kidney function decline in patients with type 2 diabetes: a slope analysis from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial.\n\n【45】_J Am Soc Nephrol._ 2018; 29 : 2755-2769\n\n【46】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (128)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【47】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【48】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【49】*   Perkovic V.\n*   Jardine M.J.\n*   Neal B.\n*   et al.\n\n【50】Canagliflozin and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.\n\n【51】_N Engl J Med._ 2019; 380 : 2295-2306\n\n【52】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (3063)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【53】Additionally, a meta-analysis found that SGLT2i use may halve the risk for advanced kidney disease in patients with T2DM.\n\n【54】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【55】*   Zelniker T.A.\n*   Wiviott S.D.\n*   Raz I.\n*   et al.\n\n【56】SGLT2 inhibitors for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcome trials.\n\n【57】_Lancet._ 2019; 393 : 31-39\n\n【58】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1709)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【59】However, this knowledge is mainly derived from placebo-controlled trials; hence, it is unclear whether SGLT2i classes have a renoprotective effect superior to GLMs of other classes (o-GLM).

Individual consent was waived because we used anonymized data.\n\n【68】### Data Source\n\n【69】This population-based, new-user, active-comparator, longitudinal cohort study used the real-world data (RWD) database; this database is maintained by Health, Clinic, and Education Information Evaluation Institute (HCEI; Kyoto, Japan) — a not-for-profit research service foundation, with support from Real World Data Co., Ltd (Kyoto, Japan). This database contains the records of ∼20 million patients from ∼160 medical institutions across Japan. The stored information includes demographic data, diagnoses, prescriptions, procedures, and laboratory results from both outpatient and inpatient services. The data were automatically extracted from electronic medical records at each medical institution. Patient records are maintained by allocating unique identifiers for each individual, which are valid within the same institution.\n\n【70】### Base T2DM Cohort\n\n【71】The base T2DM cohort included adult patients with T2DM and both (1) at least one or more prescription of GLM after April 2014 when SGLT2i was introduced in Japan; and (2) at least one or more laboratory result for both hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and serum creatinine (s-Cr) at an outpatient visit. The definition for an adult patient in this cohort was 20 years of age or older as of 2014.\n\n【72】The use of GLM was identified by the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code of “A10.” Diagnosis of T2DM relied on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision codes of E11 (“diabetes mellitus, type 2”) and E14 (“diabetes, unspecified”). We included code E14 because our preliminary search showed that it was found in more than 50% of individuals in our dataset. To minimize the risk of disease misclassification for individuals with the diagnostic code E14, we excluded patients who also had any of the following codes at any visit: E10 (“diabetes mellitus, type 1”), E12 (“diabetes mellitus, malnutrition-related”), and E13 (“other specified diabetes mellitus”). We did not use code O241 (“pre-existing T2DM in pregnancy”) to identify patients with T2DM.\n\n【73】HCEI screened and extracted data on patients with at least one diagnosis of diabetes (diagnostic code: E10–E14) from the oldest electronically stored records at each institution to the end of 2017/2018 (depending on the institution). Subsequent extractions were performed by the authors to assemble the base T2DM cohort (E11 and E14).\n\n【74】### Study Cohort\n\n【75】From the base T2DM cohort, we constituted a study cohort of SGLT2i initiators and o-GLM initiators. Patients who initiated SGLT2i or o-GLM after April 2014 were retrieved, with or without medication use before April 2014; a patient could enter the cohort only once, and SGLT2i initiators and o-GLM initiators were mutually exclusive. The index date of each patient was defined as the earliest date when SGLT2i or o-GLM was started after April 2014, including switch or add-on. To enter the study cohort, more than 365 days of data history in an RWD institution before the index date was required to see the baseline variables such as comorbidity or medication use. Additionally, laboratory evaluations of (1) s-Cr and HbA1c before the index date within 90 days; and (2) measurement of s-Cr after 90 days or longer from the index date were both required for study cohort entry. We only included individuals with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) greater than or equal to 30 mL/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> per minute to maintain consistency with participants in previous RCTs of SGLT2i. Records of individuals were traced at the end of the last visit at each institution, regardless of whether the index treatment was continued (intention-to-treat basis). The observation period for renal outcomes was defined as the index date to the last date of available s-Cr measurement at each institution. The time window of this study is summarized in Supplemental Figure 1 (available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ).\n\n【76】### Definition of Outcomes\n\n【77】We calculated the eGFR using the following well-validated formula that was specifically developed for the Japanese population.\n\n【78】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【79】*   Matsuo S.\n*   Imai E.\n*   Horio M.\n*   et al.\n\n【80】Revised equations for estimated GFR from serum creatinine in Japan.\n\n【81】_Am J Kidney Dis._ 2009; 53 : 982-992\n\n【82】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (4717)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【83】_eGFR (mL/min per 1.73 m2) = 194 × s-Cr–1·094 (mg/dL) × age–0·287 (years) (× 0.739 for females)_\n\n【84】The baseline eGFR of each individual was estimated using s-Cr results measured at the closest visit within 90 days of the index date.\n\n【85】### Study Outcomes\n\n【86】As a primary outcome, we graphically presented spline curves showing eGFR progression over time in SGLT2i users and o-GLM users without statistical testing for significance (because of the statistical software that we used). As first subgroup analysis, these graphical presentations were provided separately in three categories stratified by baseline renal function: baseline eGFR greater than or equal to 90, 60 to 89, and 30 to 59 mL/ 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> per minute. The evolution of eGFR was also presented in the second subgroup analysis stratified by six SGLT2i formulations.\n\n【87】As a secondary outcome, the incidence of sustained renal worsening and the development of eGFR less than 30 mL/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> per minute were combined into a composite renal endpoint and compared between groups. Renal worsening was defined as a greater than 40% decline of eGFR from the baseline value.\n\n【88】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【89】*   Neal B.\n*   Perkovic V.\n*   Mahaffey K.W.\n*   et al.\n\n【90】Canagliflozin and cardiovascular and renal events in type 2 diabetes.\n\n【91】_N Engl J Med._ 2017; 377 : 644-657\n\n【92】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2430)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【93】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【94】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【95】*   Wanner C.\n*   Inzucchi S.E.\n*   Lachin J.M.\n*   et al.\n\n【96】Empagliflozin and progression of kidney disease in type 2 diabetes.\n\n【97】_N Engl J Med._ 2016; 375 : 323-334\n\n【98】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2213)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【99】For both endpoints, at least two measurements 30 days or more apart were required to ensure sustained deterioration.\n\n【100】### Statistical Analysis\n\n【101】Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient profiles and were reported as means with standard deviations, medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs), or numbers with percentages.\n\n【102】We performed propensity score (PS)–based analyses to ensure the baseline balances at initiating SGLT2i or o-GLM.\n\n【103】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【104】*   Austin P.C.\n\n【105】An introduction to propensity score methods for reducing the effects of confounding in observational studies.\n\n【106】_Multivariate Behav Res._ 2011; 46 : 399-424\n\n【107】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (6655)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【108】Variables for PS calculations were age (at index date), sex, calendar year of the index date, baseline eGFR, HbA1c (closest to the index date), hypertension (diagnosed before the index date), diabetic retinopathy (diagnosed before the index date), and cumulative days exposed to any GLM within 365 days of preceding the index date (categorized into <120 days, 120–240 days, and ≥240 days). These variables were selected a priori because they are known or potential risk factors of diabetic nephropathy or the proxy for risk factors. PS was calculated using the logistic regression model, and the nearest-neighbor caliper width of 0.1 multiplied by the standard deviation of the PS distribution was used for matching. For each SGLT2i initiator, up to two o-GLM initiators were matched without replacement. Balancing after matching was assessed by standardized differences.

First, we created a new spline curve limited to the period under the initial therapeutic regimen. For this analysis, data were limited from the index date to the last s-Cr measurement date before discontinuation (defined as an absence or a gap of ≥120 days until the next prescription of the index GLM), or switching to or adding another class of GLM, whichever occurred first; for those individuals without such events, all available data were used in the analysis. Second, a nonparsimonious, one-to-two PS matching was conducted to assess how the selection of PS variables affected cohort selection and primary renal outcome. Forty-six variables for this analysis were determined by modifying the covariates in the Comparative Effectiveness of Cardiovascular Outcomes in New Users of SGLT-2 Inhibitors study,\n\n【136】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【137】*   Kosiborod M.\n*   Cavender M.A.\n*   Fu A.Z.\n*   et al.\n\n【138】Lower risk of heart failure and death in patients initiated on sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors versus other glucose-lowering drugs: the CVD-REAL study.\n\n【139】_Circulation._ 2017; 136 : 249-259\n\n【140】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (629)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【141】including numerous risk factors for micro- and macrovascular complications, relevant drugs, and procedures ( Supplemental Table 2 ; available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ).\n\n【142】### Quantitative Bias Analysis\n\n【143】We calculated E-value (as relative risk) to evaluate the minimal strength of unmeasured confounding to negate the observed HR in our survival analysis.\n\n【144】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【145】*   VanderWeele T.J.\n*   Ding P.\n\n【146】Sensitivity analysis in observational research: introducing the E-value.\n\n【147】_Ann Intern Med._ 2017; 167 : 268-274\n\n【148】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2222)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【149】The higher the E-value is, the stronger the unmeasured confounding should be to explain away the observed association.\n\n【150】Results\n-------\n\n【151】### Characteristics of Study Population\n\n【152】From HCEI, we obtained data from 900,451 individuals with all types of diabetes, regardless of medication use or age. We then formed a base T2DM cohort of 42,070 individuals ( Figure 1 ). The median age in 2014 was 69 (IQR: 61-77) years old, and 62.4% of individuals were male (n=26,272). Among the 42,070 individuals, 14,946 persons initiating either SGLT2i or o-GLMs met the inclusion criteria: 1444 in the SGLT2i group and 13,502 in the o-GLM group. The two groups differed in age, glycemic control, baseline renal function, and history of medication use ( Table 1 ). The time course of eGFR in this population is shown in Supplemental Figure 2 (available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ).\n\n【153】Figure 1 Flow chart of creating study cohort.

In this matched cohort, index GLMs in SGLT2i users were ipragliflozin (n=441; 30.8%), empagliflozin (n=313; 21.8%), dapagliflozin (n=228; 16.1%), tofogliflozin (n=210; 14.7%), luseogliflozin (n=131; 9.1%), and canagliflozin (n=108; 7.5%). In the o-GLM group, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (33.2%) was the most commonly used class of index GLM, followed by metformin (24.7%) and insulin (20.4%); in this group, 404 individuals (14.7%) initiated some combination of o-GLM, with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor and metformin being the most common (n=218).\n\n【162】### Study Outcomes\n\n【163】During a median observation period of 17 months per person (IQR: 9-27 months, maximum: 54 months), the evolution of eGFR is shown in Figure 2 (the partially expanded graph with 95% confidence bands and observed “initial dip” in SGLT2 users is presented as Supplemental Figure 5 ; available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ). Overall, the eGFR slope was more gradual in SGLT2i group. In the post hoc analysis, there was a change point at ∼6 months in slope of SGLT2i group and at ∼10 months in o-GLM group, respectively. The annual decline of eGFR after the change point was also slower in SGLT2i group (0.86 \\[95% CI, 0.71- 1.01\\] mL/ 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> per minute in the SGLT2i group vs 2.06 \\[95% CI, 1.93- 2.18\\] mL/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> per minute in the o-GLM group).\n\n【164】Figure 2 Evolution of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in all matched individuals.

The dynamics of HbA1c during the same period are presented in Supplemental Figure 8 (available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ), in which better glycemic control is shown in o-GLM users.\n\n【167】During the observation period, the composite of renal events occurred in 46 of 1433 SGLT2i users (3.2%) and 121 of 2793 o-GLM users (4.4%). The cumulative incidence was lower in SGLT2i users, with an HR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.50-0.98; _P_ \\=.038) ( Figure 3 ). Each incidence rate of renal worsening or the development of eGFR less than 30 mL/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> per minute was numerically lower in SGLT2i users, but the difference was not significant for renal worsening (31 vs 80 events, HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47-1.07; _P_ \\=.11 for renal worsening; and 30 vs 84 events, HR, 0.66, 95% CI, 0.43-1.00; _P_ \\=.047 for the development of eGFR<30 mL/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> per minute).\n\n【168】Figure 3 Cumulative probability of renal composite. o-GLM = other class(es) of glucose-lowering medication; SGLT2i = sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors.\n\n【169】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【170】The E-values for incident composite renal endpoints were 2.21 (with lower limit of confidence of 1.16).\n\n【171】### Sensitivity Analysis\n\n【172】In the first sensitivity analysis limited to the period under the same drug regimen, any of discontinuation of index drug and/or switch/add-on of other classes of GLM were observed in 1957 individuals (640 of 1433 SGLT2i users \\[44.7%\\] and 1317 of 2739 o-GLM users \\[48.1%\\]). The median observation period for these 1957 patients was 6 months and 12 months for overall cohort, respectively. In the second sensitivity analysis with nonparsimonious PS matching, 1402 SGLT2i users and 2594 o-GLM users formed a cohort with good covariate balancing ( Supplemental Figures 9 and 10 ; available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ). In both sensitivity analyses, the decline of eGFR was slower in the SGLT2i group ( Supplemental Figures 11 and 12 ; available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ), similar to the finding in the primary analysis.\n\n【173】Discussion\n----------\n\n【174】This comparative effectiveness research assessed whether SGLT2i had a renoprotective effect in a general population of T2DM. Compared with o-GLM use in a PS-matched cohort, SGLT2i use was overall associated with preserved renal function, independent of glycemic control. The renal benefits of SGLT2i were noted across SGLT2i class and different baseline renal function, with the largest effects among patients with better baseline eGFR.\n\n【175】SGLT2is have a unique glucose-lowering action, and are considered a promising agent that confers renoprotection in T2DM. Besides cardiovascular benefits, the renal benefits of SGLT2i were reported from several cardiovascular outcome trials\n\n【176】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【177】*   Zinman B.\n*   Wanner C.\n*   Lachin J.M.\n*   et al.\n\n【178】Empagliflozin, cardiovascular outcomes, and mortality in type 2 diabetes.\n\n【179】_N Engl J Med._ 2015; 373 : 2117-2128\n\n【180】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (7729)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【181】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【182】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【183】*   Wiviott S.D.\n*   Raz I.\n*   Bonaca M.P.\n*   et al.\n\n【184】Dapagliflozin and cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes.\n\n【185】_N Engl J Med._ 2019; 380 : 347-357\n\n【186】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (3414)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【187】and one recent renal-outcome trial involving patients with T2DM and chronic kidney disease (Canagliflozin and Renal Events in Diabetes With Established Nephropathy Clinical Evaluation \\[CREDENCE\\] trial).

In our study, the reason for the improved glycemic control in o-GLM users is unclear, but it may reflect unmeasured factors such as difference in adherence rate.\n\n【212】One important yet unanswered issue is which patients benefit most from SGLT2i therapy. Theoretically, the amount of excreted urinary glucose as well as plasma glucose-lowering level depends on kidney function; thus, the expected effectiveness of SGLT2i can be decreased with impaired renal function.\n\n【213】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【214】*   Fioretto P.\n*   Zambon A.\n*   Rossato M.\n*   Busetto L.\n*   Vettor R.\n\n【215】SGLT2 inhibitors and the diabetic kidney.\n\n【216】_Diabetes Care._ 2016; 39 : S165-S171\n\n【217】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (247)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【218】In our study, consistent with this pharmacologic view, the largest difference of eGFR slope between SGLT2i and o-GLM user groups was found among persons with an eGFR greater than or equal to 90 mL/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> per minute ( Supplemental Figure 7 ; available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ). This finding is similar to the results of the meta-analyses from cardiovascular outcome trials (SGLT2i was favorable in patients with better renal function), but may differ from the findings from the CREDENCE trial that specifically enrolled patients at risk of renal disease progression (SGLT2i was favorable in patients with worse renal function). The reason for such discrepancy is uncertain, but it is plausible that the renal benefit of SGLT2i can be influenced by the patient risk profile, given the divergence of SGLT2i mechanism. Further research as to whom SGLT2i therapy delivers its best value may be warranted.\n\n【219】A major strength of our study was that we used objective measures of the renal endpoint. Observational studies using health care databases often determine the renal endpoint using a claims code for chronic renal disease or end-stage renal disease, for which the coding accuracy is uncertain or dependent on the physician’s opinion or the reimbursement policy.\n\n【220】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【221】*   Raschi E.\n*   Poluzzi E.\n*   Fadini G.P.\n*   Marchesini G.\n*   De Ponti F.\n\n【222】Observational research on sodium glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors: a real breakthrough?.\n\n【223】_Diabetes Obes Metab._ 2018; 20 : 2711-2723\n\n【224】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (15)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【225】This renal endpoint is also patient-centered, as compared with intermediated outcomes such as glycated hemoglobin. In addition, this study evaluated the renoprotective effect of various SGLT2i, involving agents from ipragliflozin (30%) to canagliflozin (7.5%). A renoprotective effect was observed both in an analysis combining all SGLT2i ( Figure 2 ) and in analyses separated by each SGLT2i agent ( Supplemental Figure 6 ).\n\n【226】Our study also had certain limitations. First, our matched cohort of SGLT2i users and o-GLM users may not be comparable if critical confounders were missed or misspecified in the PS model. For this reason, we performed a different model development in the sensitivity analysis (“non-parsimonious PS matching”), and observed a similar trend in the evolution of eGFR in both groups. Furthermore, to assess how unmeasured factors could influence our estimated HR for the renal composite endpoint, we calculated E-value as 2.21. These sensitivity analyses could limit the room for unmeasured confounders. Second, our observation period was relatively short to conclude the long-term renal effect of SGLT2i. Although a recent study found that the initial eGFR decline was associated with long-term adverse renal disease,\n\n【227】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【228】*   Oshima M.\n*   Jun M.\n*   Ohkuma T.\n*   et al.\n\n【229】The relationship between eGFR slope and subsequent risk of vascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in type 2 diabetes: the ADVANCE-ON study.\n\n【230】_Diabetologia._ 2019; 62 : 1988-1997\n\n【231】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (31)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【232】studies with longer follow-up duration are warranted to assess the net benefit of SGLT2i for renal outcome. Third, the misclassification of T2DM may have occurred in individuals with a diagnosis code of E14. However, GLM use was required to be enrolled into the study cohort, and we believe that this inclusion criterion limited the chance of misclassification.\n\n【233】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【234】*   Fuentes S.\n*   Cosson E.\n*   Mandereau-Bruno L.\n*   et al.\n\n【235】Identifying diabetes cases in health administrative databases: a validation study based on a large French cohort.\n\n【236】_Int J Public Health._ 2019; 64 : 441-450\n\n【237】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (26)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【238】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【239】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【240】*   Svanstrom H.\n*   Ueda P.\n*   Melbye M.\n*   et al.\n\n【241】Use of liraglutide and risk of major cardiovascular events: a register-based cohort study in Denmark and Sweden.\n\n【242】_Lancet Diabetes Endocrinol._ 2019; 7 : 106-114\n\n【243】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (47)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【244】Fourth, this study did not examine the incidence of the initiation of chronic dialysis and renal death, given the Japanese situation and the nature of the database. In Japan, the introduction and maintenance of chronic dialysis are often performed in private, specialist dialysis clinics; in such cases, follow-up was often terminated in RWD institutions. Renal death was also not easily certified in our database for similar reasons. However, the development of eGFR less than 30 mL/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> per minute occurred in a total of 114 cases, and the number of patients requiring chronic dialysis was expected to be fewer. Finally, there were relatively few drug-naïve individuals in our matched cohort. It is therefore unclear whether SGLT2i is recommended as the first-line treatment for preventing diabetic nephropathy.\n\n【245】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【246】Our study supplemented data on the renoprotective effect of SGLT2i shown in RCTs by (1) conducting a head-to-head comparison of SGLT2i and o-GLM, (2) enrolling a type 2 diabetic population in routine care practice, and (3) including a variety of SGLT2i formulations to explore the “class effect” of SGLT2i. The long-term effects of SGLT2i and which patients benefit most from SGLT2i therapy are not fully answered, awaiting future research to guide better care for patients with T2DM.\n\n【247】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【248】The authors thank Sarah Williams, PhD, from Edanz Group ( www.edanzediting.com ) for editing a draft of this manuscript.\n\n【249】Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------\n\n【250】*   Download .pdf (2.05 MB)\n    \n    Help with pdf files\n    \n    Supplemental Figures 1–12 and Supplemental Tables 1 and 2\n    \n\n【251】Supplemental material can be found online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org .

Ten laboratory variables (white blood cell count, hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, platelet count, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, albumin) were collected as input variables. Eight supervised MLAs (decision tree, naive Bayes, logistic regression, _k_ \\-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, artificial neural networks, random forest, gradient boosting) were trained and tested for classification of AC vs AH. External validation was performed with patients with AC (n=213) and AH (n=92) from the MIMIC-III database. A feature selection strategy was used to choose the best 5-variable combination. There were 143 physicians who took an online quiz to distinguish AC from AH using the same 10 laboratory variables alone.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The MLAs demonstrated excellent performances with accuracies up to 0.932 and area under the curve (AUC) up to 0.986. In external validation, the MLAs showed comparable accuracy up to 0.909 and AUC up to 0.970.

From individuals older than 17 years with hypertension, resistant hypertension was identified and prevalence was determined. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs), with adjustments for demographic characteristics, clinical variables, and medication use.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Of 470,386 hypertensive individuals, 60,327 (12.8%) were identified as having resistant disease, representing 15.3% of those taking medications. Overall, 37,061 patients (7.9%) had uncontrolled hypertension while taking 3 or more medicines. The ORs (95% CIs) for resistant hypertension were greater for black race (1.68 \\[1.62-1.75\\]), older age (1.11 \\[1.10-1.11\\] for every 5-year increase), male sex (1.06 \\[1.03-1.10\\]), and obesity (1.46 \\[1.42-1.51\\]). Medication adherence rates were higher in those with resistant hypertension (93% vs 89.8%; _P_ <.001). Chronic kidney disease (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.78-1.90), diabetes mellitus (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.53-1.63), and cardiovascular disease (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.30-1.39) were also associated with higher risk of resistant hypertension.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In a more standardized hypertension treatment environment, we observed a rate of resistant hypertension comparable with that of previous studies using more fragmented data sources. Past observations have been limited due to nonrepresentative populations, reliability of the data, heterogeneity of the treatment environments, and less than ideal control rates. This cohort, which was established using an electronic medical record–based approach, has the potential to provide a better understanding of resistant hypertension and outcomes.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BP ( blood pressure ), CKD ( chronic kidney disease ), ICD-9 ( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision ), KPSC ( Kaiser Permanente Southern California ), NHANES ( National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ), OR ( odds ratio )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

The widening of PP with advancing age and CVD is mechanistically linked to large artery stiffness. Increased large artery stiffness detrimentally alters ventricular-vascular coupling and cardiac energetics such that afterload is increased (ie, increased oxygen demand) and myocardial perfusion is reduced (ie, reduced oxygen supply). Subendocardial ischemia may serve as the substrate for lethal arrhythmogenesis. Large artery stiffness may also hasten the atherosclerotic process, contributing to plaque rupture and myocardial infarction. Atherosclerotic CVD is a notable cause of SCD and is responsible for approximately 50% to 80% of all cases.\n\n【51】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【52】*   Myerburg R.J.\n*   Junttila M.J.\n\n【53】Sudden cardiac death caused by coronary heart disease.\n\n【54】_Circulation._ 2012; 125 : 1043-1052\n\n【55】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (318)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【56】Diagnosis, treatment, and management of CVD and hypertension-related target organ damage rely exclusively on the assessment of extreme BP values during the cardiac cycle: peak (ie, systolic) and trough (ie, diastolic).

{"seq_id": "8b7b1a71-baa5-41c9-a7bf-bcd7db93d429", "title": "Jöns Jacob Berzelius – A Father of Chemistry", "text": "【0】Jöns Jacob Berzelius was born in Väversunda, Östergötland, near Linköping, Sweden, on August 20, 1779. His father, Samuel, a teacher in the Linköping Gymnasium, died when his son was 4 years of age. His mother, Elizabeth, subsequently married the pastor of the Lutheran church in the town of Norrköping, so Jacob and his sister were raised together with the 5 children of their stepfather. Conflicts with his step-siblings resulted in Berzelius taking a position as a tutor on a nearby farm in 1794, where he developed an interest in collecting and classifying flowers and insects.\n\n【1】Berzelius matriculated at the University of Uppsala in 1796, where he studied medicine. One of his professors, Anders Gustaf Ekberg (1767-1813), was the discoverer of the element tantalum. Berzelius' stepbrother introduced him to chemistry, which he found stimulating; however, the chemistry faculty in Uppsala did not encourage young Berzelius. Subsequently, he began to carry out experiments in his own quarters. He had planned to live with his aunt while in Uppsala, but her husband was not supportive; so instead, Jacob worked as an apprentice in a pharmacy. Here he learned glassblowing and became familiar with various medications.\n\n【2】Given an unpaid assistantship with a physician who worked near the Medevi mineral springs, Berzelius began analyzing the mineral content of the spring water. He read about the newly described “voltaic pile” by Alessandro Volta, which was the first reliable source of an electric current. He then built his own voltaic pile with alternating zinc discs and copper coins. His doctoral thesis at Uppsala consisted of a study of the effect of galvanic current on patients with various diseases, which produced no benefit for the patients.\n\n【3】After obtaining his medical degree in 1802 from the University of Uppsala, he secured an appointment as an assistant to the Professor of Medicine and Pharmacy at the College of Medicine in Stockholm. This institution soon became the internationally known Karolinska Institut. The owner of the house in which he lived in Stockholm was a wealthy mine owner with an interest in mineralogy and chemistry. Together, he and Berzelius carried out many electrochemical studies on minerals.\n\n【4】Early in his career, Berzelius had financial problems because his positions came with a very low salary. However, after the Professor of Medicine and Pharmacy in Stockholm died in 1807, Berzelius was appointed to the post and had a much better salary and access to an excellent laboratory. As a result, he was able to spend most of his time performing chemistry experiments.\n\n【5】In 1808, he became a member of the Swedish Academy of Science and two years later became its president. He travelled abroad meeting the leading chemists of the day, including Humphry Davy (1778-1829) in London, as well as several prominent chemists in Germany. He subsequently spent a year in France where he worked with Claude Louis Berthollet (1748-1822) in Arcueil.\n\n【6】Berzelius introduced a new system of nomenclature in which the composition of any chemical compound could be represented using the first one or two letters of the Latin names of elements, and superscripts to designate the number of atoms present. He also used dots above the letters to indicate the proportions. However, this representation was rejected by German colleagues, who instead replaced the superscripts with subscripts, and thereby created the system of chemical annotation that continues to be used today.\n\n【7】Berzelius' 1819 publication of fixed proportions of chemical elements in compounds was supported by a large number of analytical results based on precise laboratory experiments. He reported the atomic weights of 45 of the 49 elements known at the time; 39 of the determinations were results of his own experiments, and the other 6 were performed by his students.\n\n【8】Berzelius is credited with discovering the elements cerium, selenium, silicon, zirconium, titanium, and thorium. He introduced rubber tubing into the laboratory as well as filter paper for analytical chemistry. Laboratory glassware was made by utilizing the blowpipe. He also introduced the concept of catalysts and isomerism, as well as the terms “cystine” and “glycine.”\n\n【9】Berzelius corresponded with many scientists in Europe, including Gerardus Mulder, a 35-year-old Dutch chemist with whom he carried out an extensive correspondence from 1834 to 1847. Mulder, in a letter to Berzelius dated July 10, 1838, said that he had discovered an oxidized basic radical in fibrin, serum, egg albumin, and gelatin. This substance could be combined in simple ratios with sulfur and phosphorous. Recognizing the importance of this observation, Berzelius suggested the term “protein,” which is derived from the Greek adjective πρώτειος, meaning “primary” or “of the first rank or position.” Mulder was also convinced of the importance of this substance, and published two lengthy papers (75 and 23 pages) in journals of which he was the editor.\n\n【10】Berzelius also contributed to medical education in Sweden. He emphasized that large hospitals were necessary for a school of medicine to properly educate physicians. In fact, he stated that Stockholm was the only city in Sweden where a medical school could be maintained, because he felt that all other cities were too small to support a teaching hospital. He felt that practical medicine was learned by caring for patients rather than simply reading a textbook. He emphasized that although he was able to pass medical examinations after his own University training, he was not qualified to care for the sick.\n\n【11】Berzelius suffered from many medical problems throughout his life. He had severe periodic headaches (probably migraines), which occurred regularly each month around the time of the new and full moon. The attacks disappeared in later life, but he then developed recurrent gout. He also had episodes of depression.\n\n【12】He decided at the age of 56 that he should wed and have a home life. In 1835, he married Elisabeth Poppius, the 24-year-old daughter of a Swedish cabinet minister. Upon his marriage, the King of Sweden gave him the title of Baron. Although he had no children, domestic life eased his remaining years. Over time, he became more set in his ideas and refused to accept newer developments in chemistry. He spent less time in the laboratory and more of his time trying to discredit new ideas and theories. Nevertheless, along with Boyle, Lavoisier, and Dalton, Berzelius is often called a “Father of Chemistry” today.\n\n【13】He died in Stockholm August 7, 1848. His birthday on August 20 is celebrated at Stockholm University as “Berzelius Day.” He was honored philatelically by Sweden in 1939 (Scott #293, #295 and #297) and again in 1979 (Scott #1279), and by Grenada in 1987 with a transliterated first name (Scott #1536).\n\n【14】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【15】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【16】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【17】Article info\n------------\n\n【18】### Identification\n\n【19】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2017.07.020\n\n【20】### Copyright\n\n【21】© 2018 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research\n\n【22】### ScienceDirect\n\n【23】Access this article on ScienceDirect\n\n【24】Jöns Jacob Berzelius – A Father of Chemistry\n\n【25】*   \n*   \n*   \n\n【26】Hide Caption Download See figure in article\n\n【27】Toggle Thumbstrip\n\n【28】*   Figure\n    \n*   Figure\n    \n*   Figure\n    \n\n【29】*   View Large Image\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT\n\n【30】Figures\n-------\n\n【31】*   \n*   \n*   \n\n【32】Related Articles\n----------------\n\n【33】Hide Caption Download See figure in Article\n\n【34】Toggle Thumbstrip\n\n【35】*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download .PPT", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Awareness of drugs with potential DaTscan interference, such as amphetamines, antidepressants, anticholinergics, and anesthetics, is necessary to avoid the pitfall of false DaTscan diagnosis of Parkinson disease.\n\n【13】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【14】*   Booij J.\n*   Kemp P.\n\n【15】Dopamine transporter imaging with \\[123I\\]FP-CIT SPECT: potential effects of drugs.\n\n【16】_Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging._ 2008; 35 : 424-438\n\n【17】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (132)\n*   Google Scholar", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Population-level 5-year incidence trends for endovascular, open surgical, and hybrid revascularizations and major and minor amputations were determined. Limb-specific outcomes after revascularization, including major adverse limb events and amputation-free survival, were compared between initial surgical and endovascular or hybrid revascularization groups using Kaplan-Meier analysis.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】We identified 773 residents who underwent 1906 limb-procedures, including 689 open revascularizations, 685 endovascular or hybrid revascularizations, and 220 major amputations. During the 20-year study period, the incidence of endovascular and hybrid revascularizations increased, whereas the incidence of open surgical revascularizations and major amputations decreased. Incidence of revascularizations for chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) did not change. Among residents with CLTI undergoing their first revascularization on a limb, endovascular revascularization was associated with more major adverse limb events and major amputations compared with surgical revascularization during the ensuing 15 years.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The rising incidence of endovascular and hybrid revascularizations and the decreasing incidence of open surgical revascularizations for PAD were associated with a decreasing incidence of major amputations in this population between 1990 and 2009, despite a stable incidence of revascularizations for CLTI. With more major adverse limb events and major amputations after endovascular revascularization, these trends suggest that additional emphasis should be placed on improving limb salvage efforts beyond just mode of revascularization.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CLTI ( chronic limb-threatening ischemia ), ENDO ( endovascular revascularization ), HYBRID ( revascularization using both endovascular and open techniques ), MALE ( major adverse limb event ), MALE+ ( MALE or minor revascularization ), OPEN ( open surgical revascularization ), PAD ( peripheral artery disease ), REP ( Rochester Epidemiology Project )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

His father was an inventor and designer of machines. Vincent attended public schools of Chicago and, in 1918, entered the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. He received a BS degree in 1923 and an MS degree in 1924, both in chemistry.\n\n【3】In 1924, du Vigneaud worked briefly at the Jackson Laboratories of E.I. Du Pont de Nemours and Company in Wilmington, Delaware. He left that company in 1924 to become an assistant biochemist at the Graduate School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) and at the Philadelphia General Hospital, where he worked in the chemistry laboratory.\n\n【4】In 1925, du Vigneaud joined the faculty of the new School of Medicine at the University of Rochester in Rochester, New York. At the University of Rochester, he conducted research on the chemistry of insulin while working on his doctorate. In 1927, he was awarded a PhD degree in chemistry. After graduation, he became a National Research Council Fellow. This fellowship allowed him to study at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine (Baltimore, Maryland) in the Department of Pharmacology, where he isolated the amino acid cystine from crystals of insulin.\n\n【5】In 1928, du Vigneaud worked with Max Bergmann (1886-1944), an authority on the chemistry of amino acids and peptides, in Dresden and at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Berlin (Germany). Next, du Vigneaud went to Scotland to study at the University of Edinburgh and to England to study at University College of the University of London.\n\n【6】In 1930, du Vigneaud returned to the United States and joined the Department of Physiological Chemistry at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. In 1932, he became professor of biochemistry and chair of the Department of Biochemistry at the George Washington University School of Medicine in Washington, DC, a post he held until 1938, when he became professor and head of the Department of Biochemistry at Cornell University Medical College in New York City. In 1967, he left New York City to join the faculty of Cornell University at Ithaca (New York) as professor of chemistry. He retired in 1975.\n\n【7】du Vigneaud's major works were accomplished in the synthesis of penicillin, the isolation and determination of the structure of the sulfur-bearing vitamin biotin (part of the vitamin B complex), and the examination of other sulfur-containing organic compounds. In 1940, he isolated biotin, and in 1942, determined its structure. In 1954, du Vigneaud synthesized oxytocin, the first protein hormone to be synthesized. His most important book was _A Trail of Research in Sulfur Chemistry and Metabolism and Related Fields_ , published in 1952.\n\n【8】On December 1, 1978, at the age of 77 years, Vincent du Vigneaud died in White Plains, New York (about 25 miles northeast of New York City). He was honored on a stamp (Scott No. 2517c) issued in 2001 by Antigua and Barbuda.\n\n【9】Article info\n------------\n\n【10】### Identification\n\n【11】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2012.01.032\n\n【12】### Copyright\n\n【13】© 2013 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

The new year provides an opportunity to reflect on the history of our journal, the progress we made in 1999, and our plans for growth in 2000 and beyond.\n\n【1】In early 1999, we members of the Editorial Board and staff made plans to enhance the future of this journal. As we performed our analyses and initiated changes, we relied-whether intentionally or not-on the concepts outlined by James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras in their 1994 book _Built to Last_ ,\n\n【2】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【3】*   Collins JC\n*   Porras JI\n\n【4】Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies. Harperliusincss , New York, NY 1994 : 8-9\n\n【5】*   Google Scholar\n\n【6】“A visionary company \\[or, in our case, ajournal-Ed.\\] almost religiously preserves its core ideology-changing it seldom, if ever. Core values in a visionary company form a rock-solid foundation and do not drift with the trends and fashions of the day.” Collins and Porras added, however, that, “while keeping their core ideologies tightly fixed, visionary companies display a powerful drive for progress that enables them to change and adapt without compromising their cherished core ideals.”\n\n【7】For this journal, our core values are simply stated: “We will promote the advancement of clinical medicine that results from integrated progress in medical practice, research, and education.”2 While preserving our heritage of effective and fair communication, we are willing to consider all reasonable methods for making this journal respond more capably to the revolution in medicine and medical publishing that surrounds us.\n\n【8】As we completed our first round of evaluations of the journal in early 1999, our unofficial mantra became “infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure.” We expanded office personnel and space and directed a larger portion of our effort to improving communications among our staff, reviewers, authors, and readers. These efforts met with success. By the summer of 1999, we had shortened the turnaround time for manuscript reviews, and we introduced a mechanism of expedited reviews for time-sensitive materials. The overall time from manuscript acceptance to publication also was shortened. These improvements in manuscript throughput occurred even as we experienced an increasing number of submissions. In addition to improving our logistics, we initiated changes to improve the content of our journal. Specifically, we are seeking more and higher-quality original research, recognizing that excellent original research is the foundation on which the future of medicine is built. We also negotiated for stronger and more analytic editorials. Besides recruiting traditional-format editorials, in late 1999 we made plans to publish a larger number of free-standing editorials and commentaries so that our readers can be better informed about the cutting edge of medicine and its associated controversies. The new free-standing editorials will begin appearing in the pages of the _Proceedings_ this year.\n\n【9】Jerome P. Kassirer, MD, in his farewell editorial as Editor-in-Chief of _The New England Journal of Medicine_ , used the term “university without walls” to describe that journal.\n\n【10】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【11】*   Kassirer JP\n\n【12】Goodbye, for now \\[editorial\\].\n\n【13】_N Engl J Med._ 1999; 341 : 686-687\n\n【14】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (8)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【15】We too embrace this concept. Based on the idea that honest, scholarly debate is a potent stimulus for improving the quality of the journal's content, we have expanded and strengthened our Letters to the Editor section. As a result, in 1999 we witnessed a different level of debate within the pages of this journal. Other submissions to the letters section exposed us to brief original observations. The freedom allowed in this section of the journal, coupled with the relatively fast acceptance-to-publication times for letters, offers the promise of more intellectual spice in each issue.\n\n【16】As we initiated changes to the _Proceedings_ in 1999, we sought input from both fans and critics. During this process, we were impressed by the loyalty of our audience, and we were anxious to maintain the trust that has developed between the journal and our readers during its 74-year history. One of the factors contributing to this relationship is the readers' appreciation of the high-quality reviews that we publish. We plan to preserve the journal's review sections. We also will continue to publish case reports. As we do so, we will constantly reevaluate these portions of the journal to make sure that they provide valuable educational materials that reflect the current status of medical practice and inform our readers of areas of potential growth.\n\n【17】When this journal began its life in 1926 as the _Bulletin of the Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation_ , its purpose was simply to report on the multidisciplinary activities of the Mayo Clinic staff. This approach continued with the last renaming of the journal in 1964 when it became _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ . In 1996, the Editorial Board and publisher decided to change the focus of this journal from that of a multidisciplinary journal to a general medicine and internal medicine journal. This decision was intended, in part, to better reflect the demographics of our subscribers.\n\n【18】In 1999, with our journal enjoying a circulation of 120,000, our Editorial Board rededicated itself to better serving the needs of our 100,000 physician-readers whose professional interests are in general or internal medicine. In the year 2000, as in the past, authors from diverse disciplines are welcome to submit materials for publication in this journal; however, priority will be given to publishing manuscripts with a general or internal medicine message.\n\n【19】As we attempt to move this journal in a new direction, we are reminded that editors and editorial boards do not create research articles. Instead, we depend on our authors to provide the best materials possible from which we select (using a process of formal peer review) those published. We also are reminded that, prior to 1992, virtually all authors in this journal were members of the Mayo Clinic faculty. In 1992, the Editorial Board decided to publish manuscripts from outside Mayo Clinic\n\n【20】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【21】*   Palumbo PJ\n\n【22】Policy changes: another step forward \\[editorial\\].\n\n【23】_Mavo Clin Proc._ 1992; 67 : 396\n\n【24】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   Scopus (1)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【25】(although, for many, this decision has gone unnoticed). In 1999, the new leadership of the _Proceedings_ embraced the 1992 policy. As a result, extramural authors accounted for 27% of the submissions published in the journal in 1999. This reflects an increase from 20% in 1998. In 2000 and beyond, we welcome input from authors from Mayo Clinic, as well as those not affiliated with our institution, as they help us realize our goal of improving the journal's content.\n\n【26】We recognize that—now more than ever before—the public demands to be informed about the workings of physicians and scientists so that they can make better decisions about health care. In 1999, we began working more closely with the lay media to inform patients and the general public about the advances in medicine described within our pages. As we introduce these changes, we recognize that good research is judged only by scientific challenge and the test of time, not public popularity. We will, however, use any public attention to remind us to be constantly vigilant about the type and quality of materials we publish.\n\n【27】Although many of the policy and philosophical changes mentioned above have been in effect for mere months, the medical and scientific communities have responded to our changes with enthusiasm. The number of manuscripts submitted to this journal increased by one fourth in 1999, with the greatest portion of the growth coming in the latter months. We have used this opportunity not to expand the size of the journal but instead to focus the contents of this journal and improve the quality of the articles we publish. As expected, our rejection rate for the year increased by one fourth.\n\n【28】The integrity of any scientific journal is influenced by the quality and dedication of its consultant reviewers and editorial board.5 In 1999, we attempted to add new consultant reviewers to evaluate the diverse manuscripts submitted by our authors, and we attempted to better monitor the quality of all consultant reviewers' input. Effective with this issue, we also have expanded our editorial board to better address high-traffic areas (eg, in cardiology and neurology). This enlargement of the board was accomplished by adding additional extramural members.\n\n【29】To paraphrase the editorial comments of Frank Davidoff, MD, Editor of _Annals of Internal Medicine_ , the success and growth of any scientific journal depend on input from a host of individuals and groups, interacting in a series of positive feedback loops.\n\n【30】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【31】*   Davidof T\n\n【32】Hie making and unmaking of a journal \\[editorial\\].\n\n【33】_Ann Intern Med._ 1999; 130 : 774-775\n\n【34】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【35】In this regard, we at _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ have vast resources on which to build. As a conduit between our authors and those who read the _Proceedings_ , it is our responsibility to use these assets to invoke mature and evolutionary change in clinical practice so that we can better serve the present and future generations of patients. We gladly embrace this attitude of evolutionary change because we recognize that the spirit and heritage of evolutionary change are the basis by which our sponsoring organization, Mayo Foundation, has developed and maintained its leadership role in medical research, education, and practice.\n\n【36】In my introductory editorial of 1999, I invited our readers to scrutinize our work at the _Proceedings_ and let us know whether we are accomplishing our goals.\n\n【37】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【38】*   Lanier WL\n\n【39】Leading _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ into the future \\[editorial\\].\n\n【40】_Mayo Clin Proc._ 1999; 74 : 104\n\n【41】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【42】As a result of this invitation, we heard from many of you.

The populations at risk for head and neck cancers are those who have a long-standing history of smoking and alcohol use. More recently, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer in younger populations has been increasing and is associated with exposure to the human papillomavirus. This subset of patients appears to have a better overall prognosis and to respond better to treatment. This review is limited to head and neck cancers of squamous cell histology, which constitute more than 90% of head and neck cancers. Because treatment of head and neck cancers is complex and involves multiple modalities, a multidisciplinary approach is needed. This review focuses on the goal of organ preservation and postoperative treatment of high-risk patients with the concurrent use of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The reduced thermoregulatory zone is associated with increased sweating, resulting in discomfort.\n\n【33】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【34】*   Notelovitz M\n\n【35】Hot flashes and androgens: a biological rationale for clinical practice.\n\n【36】_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2004; 79 : S8-S13\n\n【37】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【38】There is little doubt that estrogen is a potent inhibitor of hot flashes.\n\n【39】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【40】*   Nelson HD\n\n【41】Commonly used types of postmenopausal estrogen for treatment of hot flashes: scientific review.\n\n【42】_JAMA._ 2004; 291 : 1610-1620\n\n【43】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (207)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【44】Many studies have shown the efficacy of estrogen for attenuation of hot flashes, and estrogen remains the gold standard for the treatment of hot flashes. However, women are reluctant to take estrogen and physicians are reluctant to recommend hormone therapy because of the recent findings from the Women's Health Initiative. As a result, many women and physicians are seeking alternatives to estrogen for the amelioration of hot flashes. Progestogens and androgens have successfully attenuated hot flashes, and each has a definite adverse-effect profile that can limit the dose used.\n\n【45】Studies of the physiology of hot flashes have revealed an association with increased norepinephrine levels in the preoptic hypothalamus in the brain. Serotonin destabilizes the thermoregulatory zone set point. The withdrawal of estrogen disrupts the balance between 2 different serotonin receptor types. This mechanism of action provides the rationale for the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for hot flashes. The SSRI venlafaxine is an antidepressant that inhibits both norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake. At lower doses, the predominant effect is to inhibit serotonin reuptake, and at higher doses, norepinephrine reuptake is altered. Several placebo-controlled studies have shown that low-dose venlafaxine reduces hot flashes up to 61% compared with a reduction of 27% with placebo.\n\n【46】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【47】*   Barton D\n*   La VB\n*   Loprinzi C\n*   Novotny P\n*   Wilwerding MB\n*   Sloan J\n\n【48】Venlafaxine for the control of hot flashes: results of a longitudinal continuation study.\n\n【49】_Oncol Nurs Forum._ 2002; 29 : 33-40\n\n【50】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (74)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【51】Fluoxetine, another SSRI, reduced hot flash scores by 50% compared with a 36% reduction with placebo.\n\n【52】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【53】*   Loprinzi CL\n*   Sloan JA\n*   Perez EA\n*   et al.\n\n【54】Phase III evaluation of fluoxetine for treatment of hot flashes.\n\n【55】_J Clin Oncol._ 2002; 20 : 1578-1583\n\n【56】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (462)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【57】In that trial, women with breast cancer were recruited, many of whom were taking a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), which may or may not have altered the effect because these compounds can precipitate hot flashes.

In addition, magnetic resonance imaging showed scattered areas of microhemorrhage consistent with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. The patient was transitioned from warfarin to apixaban therapy after this episode and was referred for consideration of LAAO.\n\n【123】### Patient B\n\n【124】An 84-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease, paroxysmal AF, a CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score of 4, and a HAS-BLED score of 4 was referred after an episode of subdural hematoma while taking warfarin after a fall. After discussion with the patient's family, she was believed to be at high fall risk given her frailty and balance issues. She was otherwise independent in her activities of daily living.\n\n【125】Figure 1 shows an algorithm for guiding appropriate patients for LAAO. The Table outlines some of the challenges encountered during evaluation of such patients and their possible solutions. Both the PROTECT AF and PREVAIL trials included patients without absolute contraindications for warfarin. Thus, the most scientifically validated indication for LAAO based on the published data is in patients who are at an increased risk for bleeding but can tolerate short-term anticoagulation. These patients are usually those with previous non–life-threatening bleeding events or those at increased risk for future bleeding (high HAS-BLED scores \\[typically ≥3\\], history of coronary artery disease while receiving dual antiplatelet therapy, and patients with end-stage renal disease \\[creatinine clearance <15-30 mL/min/1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> \\] \\[to convert to mL/s/m <sup>2 </sup> , multiply by 0.0167\\]) or elderly patients with a high fall risk. However, the decision to proceed with LAAO in any patient should be made using a shared decision-making process similar to any other interventional procedure. The upfront risks involved with an invasive procedure, the benefits of reduced bleeding in the future, as well as the noninferiority of LAAO to warfarin in terms of study end points should be explained to the patients. A recent patient-level meta-analysis of the PROTECT AF trial, the PREVAIL trial, and their continued-access registry data has further concluded that the Watchman device is superior compared with warfarin in terms of lower hemorrhagic stroke (0.15 vs 0.96 events per 100 patient-years of follow-up), cardiovascular/unexplained death (1.1 vs 2.3 events per 100 patient-years; _P_ \\=.006), and nonprocedural bleeding (6 vs 11.3 events per 100 patient-years; hazard ratio, 0.51; _P_ \\=.006).\n\n【126】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【127】*   Holmes Jr., D.R.\n*   Doshi S.K.\n*   Kar S.\n*   et al.\n\n【128】Left atrial appendage closure as an alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation: a patient-level meta-analysis.\n\n【129】_J Am Coll Cardiol._ 2015; 65 : 2614-2623\n\n【130】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (415)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【131】The initial safety concerns notwithstanding, the safety of LAAO in “real-world” clinical practice has been demonstrated, with low rates of cardiac tamponade (1.09%), procedural stroke (0.078%), and mortality (0.078%) reported from 3822 consecutive Watchman cases after FDA approval.\n\n【132】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【133】Reddy VY, Gibson DN, Kar S, et al.

The earliest data on this specific cohort of patients came from the Percutaneous Left Atrial Appendage Transcatheter Occlusion (PLAATO) feasibility study, which studied the first endocardial LAAO device in 64 patients with contraindications to anticoagulation. The patients were given only antiplatelet therapy after LAAO, and during follow-up of 129 documented patient-years, there was a lower-than-predicted rate of stroke based on CHADS <sub>2 </sub> score (3.8% vs 6.6% predicted). This concept of only antiplatelet agents after LAAO has also been applied using the ACP. In a study with 52 patients, LAAO with ACP followed by dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 to 3 months and single antiplatelet agent thereafter, there were low rates of embolic and bleeding events at 20 months.\n\n【183】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【184】*   Urena M.\n*   Rodes-Cabau J.\n*   Freixa X.\n*   et al.\n\n【185】Percutaneous left atrial appendage closure with the AMPLATZER cardiac plug device in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation and contraindications to anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【186】_J Am Coll Cardiol._ 2013; 62 : 96-102\n\n【187】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (226)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【188】The most recent data on patients with AF with absolute contraindications to anticoagulation and LAAO comes from the ASA Plavix Feasibility Study With Watchman Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology (ASAP).\n\n【189】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【190】*   Reddy V.Y.\n*   Mobius-Winkler S.\n*   Miller M.A.\n*   et al.\n\n【191】Left atrial appendage closure with the Watchman device in patients with a contraindication for oral anticoagulation: the ASAP study (ASA Plavix Feasibility Study With Watchman Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology).\n\n【192】_J Am Coll Cardiol._ 2013; 61 : 2551-2556\n\n【193】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (578)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【194】The authors followed 150 patients with nonvalvular AF who underwent LAAO with the Watchman device (mean ± SD CHA <sub>2 </sub> DS <sub>2 </sub> \\-VASc score of 4.4±1.7) for a mean ± SD duration of 14.4±8.6 months.

The patient's preprocedural evaluation, including computed tomography, was completed, and he was believed to be a suitable candidate for LAAO using a Watchman device. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) could not be performed preprocedurally or intraprocedurally given the patient's history of esophagectomy with gastric pull through for adenocarcinoma.\n\n【240】The Watchman device, available in 5 sizes from 21 to 33 mm, has a nitinol frame with 10 active fixation barbs covered with a 160-μm polyethylene terephthalate membrane to prevent embolization. The maximal LAA ostium size needs to be 17 to 31 mm, and the workable LAA depth should be greater than the ostium maximal width. Patient F had an LAA ostium that was wider than recommendations ( Figure 2 ) and instead underwent successful surgical AtriClip, described earlier. Another option for such patients with a smaller LAA is the ACP Amulet device described earlier. Amulet is available in 8 different sizes from 16 to 34 mm and can accommodate smaller LAA anatomies (maximum landing zone width of 11-31 mm).\n\n【241】Figure 2 Computed tomographic (CT) and transesophageal echocardiographic (TEE) images showing large left atrial appendages (LAAs) not suitable for the Watchman device.

However, some patients, such as patient G (with esophagectomy), have anatomical reasons that preclude TEE. Therefore, we performed the procedure successfully under intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) guidance ( Figure 3 ). Also, ICE offers the advantage of avoiding general anesthesia and intubation. The disadvantages of using ICE include limited 45° views for LAA evaluation, which can sometimes be partly overcome by imaging the LAA from the right ventricular outflow tract or advancing the ICE probe through the transseptal puncture site into the LA.\n\n【244】<sup><a>30</a></sup>\n\n【245】*   Fassini G.\n*   Dello Russo A.\n*   Conti S.\n*   Tondo C.\n\n【246】An alternative transseptal intracardiac echocardiography strategy to guide left atrial appendage closure: the first described case.\n\n【247】_J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol._ 2014; 25 : 1269-1271\n\n【248】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (19)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【249】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【250】<sup><a>31</a></sup>\n\n【251】*   Desimone C.V.\n*   Asirvatham S.J.\n\n【252】ICE imaging of the left atrial appendage.\n\n【253】_J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol._ 2014; 25 : 1272-1274\n\n【254】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (10)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【255】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【256】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【257】*   Matsuo Y.\n*   Neuzil P.\n*   Petru J.\n*   et al.\n\n【258】Left atrial appendage closure under intracardiac echocardiographic guidance: feasibility and comparison with transesophageal echocardiography.\n\n【259】_J Am Heart Assoc._ 2016; 5\n\n【260】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (44)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【261】In a series of 27 patients, Matsuo et al\n\n【262】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【263】*   Matsuo Y.\n*   Neuzil P.\n*   Petru J.\n*   et al.\n\n【264】Left atrial appendage closure under intracardiac echocardiographic guidance: feasibility and comparison with transesophageal echocardiography.\n\n【265】_J Am Heart Assoc._ 2016; 5\n\n【266】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (44)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【267】reported successful ICE-guided LAAO using the Watchman device in all the patients.

By 2010, however, it had also become very clear that several measures of cardiovascular health in the US population were showing disturbingly negative trends, including an alarming increase in the prevalence of obesity and diabetes, and stagnant trends in smoking cessation and blood pressure optimization. Objective projections of cardiovascular disease rates made it clear that unless the current trends in cardiovascular risk factor prevalence change, the incidence of cardiovascular events will probably increase again by 2020.\n\n【27】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【28】*   Lopez-Jimenez F.\n*   Batsis J.A.\n*   Roger V.L.\n*   Brekke L.\n*   Ting H.H.\n*   Somers V.K.\n\n【29】Trends in 10-year predicted risk of cardiovascular disease in the United States, 1976 to 2004.\n\n【30】_Circ Cardiovasc Qual Outcomes._ 2009; 2 : 443-450\n\n【31】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (43)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【32】Therefore, in 2010, the AHA published the 2020 goal that includes a new definition of cardiovascular health represented by an aggregate of 7 health behaviors and factors, with the goal of monitoring cardiovascular health trends in the population and assessing progress toward the goal of 20% reduction in cardiovascular mortality.\n\n【33】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【34】*   Lloyd-Jones D.M.\n*   Hong Y.\n*   Labarthe D.\n*   et al.\n\n【35】American Heart Association Strategic Planning Task Force and Statistics Committee  \nAmerican Heart Association Strategic Planning Task Force and Statistics Committee.\n\n【36】_Circulation._ 2010; 121 : 586-613\n\n【37】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (3044)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【38】Those 7 factors were labeled _The Simple 7_ and have been promoted in the general population to enhance awareness of and promote heart-healthy behaviors.\n\n【39】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【40】American Heart Association  \nMy Life Check: Life's Simple 7.\n\n【41】www.heart.org/mylifecheck.com\n\n【42】*   Google Scholar\n\n【43】The new definition of cardiovascular health, based on input from various working groups within the AHA, has several strengths: it combines some of the most relevant health behaviors and factors known to decrease cardiovascular risk, and it provides specific goals for each metric in a relatively simple way. Although more than 50 cardiovascular risk factors have been identified to date, it would be impractical to set too many targets, especially for those that are not modifiable such as sex, age, or family history of premature coronary disease. Instead of a deterministic definition of cardiovascular health, the new AHA definition emphasizes the importance of modifiable risk factors for which patients can take ownership and control.\n\n【44】However, this new definition of cardiovascular health also has shortcomings. The details of each component of the new definition are not consistently evidence based, and some important factors are not addressed.

The results from Artero and associates' analysis underscore the importance of increasing the efforts to improve the cardiovascular health of the US population.\n\n【88】The new definition of cardiovascular health and the related Simple 7 campaign are important steps to increase awareness about cardiovascular risk in the general population and to encourage people to set personal goals. However, increasing awareness by itself without implementing or providing proven strategies of intervention has failed to improve health behavior. As one example, most current smokers are generally aware that their smoking habits are unhealthy but find themselves unable to quit. Major improvements in cardiovascular health in the population will occur only if increased awareness and willingness to improve personal health coincide with changes in public policy, population-based interventions, and the implementation of universal health care.\n\n【89】Extensive research has demonstrated that changes in public policy impact the prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors more than any other strategy. The implementation of a smoking ban in public places has been a key factor in reducing the prevalence of smoking among adults, lowering both exposure to second-hand smoke and coronary event rates.\n\n【90】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【91】*   McNabola A.\n*   Gill L.W.\n\n【92】The control of environmental tobacco smoke: a policy review.\n\n【93】_Int J Environ Res Public Health._ 2009; 6 : 741-758\n\n【94】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (46)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【95】Results from the North Karelia project show that after taxing unhealthy foods and subsidizing fruits and vegetables, people changed their food choices and improved their diets, followed by an impressive reduction in cardiovascular mortality.\n\n【96】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【97】*   Neroth P.\n\n【98】Fat of the land.\n\n【99】_Lancet._ 2004; 364 : 651-653\n\n【100】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (3)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【101】Humans have economic minds sensitive to prices and to the perception of value, proving that human behavior is many times driven by factors unrelated to risk perception or recognition of health benefits. Likewise, changes in the composition of school lunches, regulations to prevent direct marketing of food to children, and promoting more physical activity in schools will likely impact cardiovascular health in the long term. Urban designers should also include more spaces that facilitate regular exercise and physical activity associated with both individual and group sports. Redesigning roads to accommodate pedestrians and bicyclers would be another strategy to promote simple ways of incorporating regular physical activity in busy daily lives.\n\n【102】The role of universal access to health care cannot be overlooked when pursuing ideal cardiovascular health in the population. Before people become diabetic or hypertensive, they experience years of impaired fasting blood glucose or suboptimal blood pressure levels. The identification of “predisease stages” alerts patients and physicians about the need to take a more proactive approach implementing healthier lifestyles. Thus, access to health care where those factors can be identified and addressed in a timely manner will help to foster primordial prevention in the whole population.\n\n【103】During the past 30 years, there have been numerous advances and innovations to reduce cardiovascular disease risk and related deaths. It is widely accepted that if people follow the basic principles of cardiovascular disease prevention (no smoking, regular physical activity, healthy diet, and keeping hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes under control), their risk for cardiovascular death can be reduced by more than 75%.\n\n【104】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【105】*   Stamler J.\n*   Stamler R.\n*   Neaton J.D.\n*   et al.\n\n【106】Low risk-factor profile and long-term cardiovascular and noncardiovascular mortality and life expectancy: findings for 5 large cohorts of young adult and middle-aged men and women.\n\n【107】_JAMA._ 1999; 282 : 2012-2018\n\n【108】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (581)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【109】However, currently available data are less instructive in identifying how to change human behavior in an effective and lasting way as a means to improve outcomes. More research is needed to better understand the factors that trigger and maintain healthy behaviors and improve compliance with medical treatments. We know we have a long way to go before achieving the 2020 goals when interventions for smoking cessation that have no more than a 20% quitting rate are considered “successful” and when the overwhelming majority of people with obesity who lose weight will regain all of the weight lost in less than a year.\n\n【110】The challenges ahead of us are immense, and the responsibility to prevent a reversal of the favorable trends in cardiovascular disease should be shared among individuals, scientists, leaders in public policy, and society as a whole. The ultimate victory against cardiovascular disease will come when personal accountability, effective primary care practices, public policy, population-based interventions, and universal health care work in concert.

The authors describe 4 boys, aged 10 to 13 years, who were accidentally buried in sand, 2 of whom died as a result of the accident. The mechanism of injury in this report is somewhat different from that in previous publications that focused on sand aspiration and its management.\n\n【7】The current study indicates that the 2 boys died of asphyxia from thoracic compression due to the weight of the sand. The first boy was digging a tunnel in a backyard sandbox that collapsed on him. He was buried for about 10 minutes in dry sand and was unable to extricate himself. The boy had been playing unsupervised. The other 3 boys jumped into a large (30 feet) pile of wet sand at a construction site. As they ran down the sandpile, it collapsed and completely buried 1 boy and partially buried the other 2 boys. The completely buried youngster was under 12 feet of wet sand; he could not be rescued in time and died of thoracic compression asphyxia. One boy extricated himself and successfully sought help for his partially buried friend. These 3 boys were also unsu-pervised, and there was no information regarding the security or safety factors in place at the construction site. Neither of the 2 boys who died had evidence of sand aspiration.\n\n【8】Sand is composed of aluminum silicate, silicon dioxide, and calcium carbonate and is defined as sedimentary particles with a diameter of 0.05 to 2.0 mm. This distinguishes sand from larger particles such as gravel and smaller particles such as silt and clay. What is significant in the current report is the calculated weight of wet sand (in tons) that restricted the boys’ attempts at breathing, resulting in compressive thoracic asphyxia. Although highly unusual, these occurrences document a previously undescribed mechanism of injury in childhood sand burial. Of interest is the fact that all 4 were boys. It is well-known that boys are more frequently involved in accidents, presumably due to more adventurous and risky behavior.\n\n【9】During the summer months, newspapers, magazines, and television commercials often show youngsters building sand castles or instances of intentional sand burial up to the shoulder level, suggesting these activities are popular playtime pursuits ( Figure 1 , Figure 2 ). The current report unmasks the potential dangers associated with these activities.\n\n【10】Figure 1 Child playing in the sandbox in his backyard.

Safety precautions at potentially dangerous construction sites and industrial sand storage facilities should be instituted as part of an accident-prevention program with appropriate inspections to ensure compliance. Protective fences and security personnel are reasonable considerations in attempts to achieve this goal. Areas at risk include large sand dunes (often associated with sand holes), deep beach diggings, and large sand castles or tunnels. Such activities could be limited to specific sites in recreational areas that are well supervised by parents, lifeguards, or other beach or park personnel. The fact that 1 of the boys died in a deep sandbox in his backyard also suggests that a limitation in the depth of domestic sandboxes for children needs to be addressed.\n\n【15】An important message is that young children need to be supervised. If either of the 2 reported events had been observed, the chance of prompt extrication and survival would have been better. The authors are to be praised for making this information available to their medical colleagues. However, the message also needs to reach public health and accident-prevention officials in the community.

We analyzed cross-sectional data of the multisite, international hospital-based MRI-Genetics Interface Exploration study with clinical brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained on admission for index stroke and functional outcome assessment. Poststroke outcome was determined using the modified Rankin Scale score (0-6; 0 = asymptomatic; 6 = death) recorded between 60 and 190 days after stroke. Demographic characteristics and other clinical variables including acute stroke severity (measured as National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score), vascular risk factors, and etiologic stroke subtypes (Causative Classification of Stroke system) were recorded during index admission.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Utilizing the data from 912 patients with AIS (mean ± SD age, 65.3±14.5 years; male, 532 \\[58.3%\\]; history of smoking, 519 \\[56.9%\\]; hypertension, 595 \\[65.2%\\]) in a generalized linear model, brain volume (per 155.1 cm <sup>3 </sup> ) was associated with age (β −0.3 \\[per 14.4 years\\]), male sex (β 1.0), and prior stroke (β −0.2). In the multivariable outcome model, brain volume was an independent predictor of modified Rankin Scale score (β −0.233), with reduced odds of worse long-term functional outcomes (odds ratio, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9) in those with larger brain volumes.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Larger brain volume quantified on clinical magnetic resonance imaging of patients with AIS at the time of stroke purports a protective mechanism.

As the situation unfolded into a pandemic, our task force provided predictive insights through a structured set of visualizations and key messages that have helped the practice to anticipate and react to changing operational needs and opportunities. The framework shared here for the deployment of a COVID-19 predictive analytics task force could be adapted for effective implementation at other institutions to provide evidence-based messaging for operational decision-making. For hospitals without such a structure, immediate consideration may be warranted in light of the devastating COVID-19 third-wave which has arrived for winter 2020–2021.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CDT ( case doubling time ), COVID-19 ( coronavirus disease 2019 ), DMC ( destination medical center ), EHR ( electronic health record ), ICU ( intensive care unit ), PPE ( personal protective equipment )\n\n【4】Before the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States, the American Hospital Association hosted a webinar in which a “best guess epidemiology” scenario suggested that COVID-19 cases could double every 7 to 10 days and lead to 5 million COVID-19 hospitalizations across the United States, while warning that hospitals should prepare for a health care burden 10 times worse than a severe flu season.\n\n【5】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【6】American Hospital Association.

By the following week, the United States confirmed case count had climbed to more than 1000, indicating an alarming potential for a quicker case doubling time (CDT) than the predicted 7 to 10 days.\n\n【9】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【10】The COVID tracking project  \nThe Atlantic Monthly Group. 2020.\n\n【11】https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily\n\n【12】Date accessed: July 28, 2020\n\n【13】*   Google Scholar\n\n【14】This explosive early trajectory sparked a national discussion that the pandemic could soon overwhelm US health system capacities and pose a threat to the health and safety of both COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 hospitalized patients. At that time, this exact scenario was unfolding simultaneously across northern Italy, with overwhelmed hospitals reportedly housing patients on mattresses on the floor while struggling to provide basic services such as palliative care and child delivery.\n\n【15】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【16】*   Nacoti M.\n*   Ciocca A.\n*   Giupponi A.\n*   Brambillasca P.\n*   et al.\n\n【17】At the Epicenter of the Covid-19 Pandemic and Humanitarian Crises in Italy: Changing Perspectives on Preparation and Mitigation.

Here, we share the approach initiated at Mayo Clinic in early March to rapidly assemble and deploy an interdisciplinary, agile task force of academic, clinical, and hospital administrative experts to provide actionable prediction of the COVID-19 impacts on hospital census and operations.\n\n【22】Formation of the COVID-19 Predictive Analytics Task Force\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Following Mayo Clinic’s rich history of being a physician-lead matrix organization, the executive dean of practice funded the identification of a COVID-19 data governor group consisting of the chief value officer, division chair, health care policy research, and chair, quality, experience, and affordability. The first task of the three data governors was to develop an interdisciplinary predictive analytics task force. The interdisciplinary COVID-19 predictive analytics task force was conceived as a partnership between the physician, scientific, and administrative leadership of Mayo Clinic entities including Quality, Experience, and Affordability; the Department of Health Sciences Research; the Department of Data and Analytics, and the Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery. Briefly, the mission of the Kern Center is to develop, analyze, and rapidly diffuse transformative health care solutions through partnership with the practice.\n\n【24】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【25】Science of Health Care Delivery: Robert D. and Patricia E.

The deliverable goal was to provide ongoing COVID-19 predictive analytics reporting to hospital leadership across Mayo Clinic sites with key messages updated multiple times per week.\n\n【30】An economic impact analysis was not considered in-scope. The primary focus of this task force was to be able to predict capacity to help operational decision-making and to ensure safety of patients returning to campus. With a clear mission and deliverable defined, task force leadership strategically recruited members from multiple departments and roles to ensure diverse expertise across multiple scientific domains including infectious disease, health services research and policy, statistics, bioinformatics, digital health, epidemiology, and hospital operations, with strong representation from clinical and administrative leadership at each of the Mayo Clinic destination medical centers (DMCs) in Rochester, MN; Phoenix, AZ; and Jacksonville, FL ( Table 1 ). During the first 2 months (March and April 2020), the task force meeting schedule consisted of daily 1-hour Zoom video conferences (Monday through Friday) with ad hoc weekend calls as necessary. An assigned project manager coordinated task force meeting agendas and key messages.\n\n【31】Table 1 Composition of Interdisciplinary Coronavirus Disease 2019 Predictive Analytics Task Force\n\n【32】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【33】COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; MD, medical doctor; PPE, personal protective equipment.\n\n| Pre–COVID-19 role at Mayo Clinic | Role on COVID-19 task force |\n| --- | --- |\n| Chair of Quality, Experience, and Affordability (Administrative Leader) | Serve as task force leadership by bringing team together, communicating vision and directives, and facilitating dissemination of analytics with hospital practice leadership. |\n| Chief Value Officer (Physician Leader) |  |\n| Director of Research, Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery (Scientist Leader) |  |\n| Project management | Set meeting cadence, assist with communication of key messages and drafting of report materials, and provide pre-meeting agendas and post-meeting summaries. |\n| Faculty-level Subject Matter Experts with expertise in artificial, intelligence, natural language processing, biostatistics, digital health, epidemiology, and health policy/health services research | Assess predictive analytic methodologies, create automated visual data display/dashboards, review literature, and develop data-driven/evidence-based assumptions for inputs of predictive models. |\n| Staff statisticians, data scientists, and analysts | Investigate external COVID-19 models for utility and adaptability to Mayo Clinic hospitals and investigate/compile reliable county-level data sources. |\n| Chair, Department of Data and Analytics | Lead the development of COVID-19 testing and inpatient data mart. |\n| Chair, Infection Prevention and Control | Lead surveillance of nosocomial infections and communicate PPE guidelines and best practices. |\n| Infectious disease physicians | Provide expertise on infectious disease transmission. |\n| Clinical practice leadership (MDs) | Provide expertise and frontline insight of COVID-19 issues/concerns voiced by the practice while critically reviewing deliverables and key messages for effective communication with the practice. |\n\n【35】a COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; MD, medical doctor; PPE, personal protective equipment.\n\n【36】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【37】Task Force Assessment of External COVID-19 Hospital Use Prediction Models\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【38】The first priority undertaken by the task force was to comprehensively identify and assess all external COVID-19 prediction models to gain an understanding of their methodologies and outputs.

For example, many models predicted COVID-19 cases at the state or county level, but were unable to account for local hospital-level inputs such as length of stay, total available medical and ICU beds, or intra-institutional patient transfer between regional hospitals.\n\n【94】As the task force continued to test external models, a solid conceptual understanding of the key variables and inputs needed for predictive COVID-19 modeling specific to our hospital system was formed within the group. This was accomplished using rapid cycles of change within an agile framework. Key model inputs identified through this approach included community-level case doubling time, test positivity rate, hospitalization rate, and effectiveness of social distancing. Ultimately, the handful of external models which provided flexibility for end-users to input community- and hospital-specific parameters used small studies reliant on early Chinese data\n\n【95】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【96】*   Li Q.\n*   Guan X.H.\n*   Wu P.\n*   et al.\n\n【97】Early transmission dynamics in Wuhan, China, of novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia.\n\n【98】_N Engl J Med._ 2020; 382 : 1199-1207\n\n【99】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (9992)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【100】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【101】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【102】*   Linton N.M.\n*   Kobayashi T.\n*   Yang Y.C.\n*   et al.\n\n【103】Incubation period and other epidemiological characteristics of 2019 novel coronavirus infections with right truncation: a statistical analysis of publicly available case data.\n\n【104】_J Clin Med._ 2020; 9 : 538\n\n【105】*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (763)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【106】to set default parameter values. The generalizability of these values to other hospitals was often unknown and it was not possible to refresh these values with real-time hospital- and community-specific data. Furthermore, for these tools to be operational for the practice, we needed to have high data availability, automation in the data curation and tabulation processes, and succinct visuals to convey the message at a time when both hospital staff and leadership were under extreme pressures. As such, the task force recognized a need for the development of an internal data framework to compile state-, county-, and hospital-level testing and case data so that we could update critical model assumptions on a daily basis with data relevant to each of our unique hospital regions.\n\n【107】Development of Dashboards to Display Key Internal and External COVID-19 Metrics\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【108】Having recognized a need for real-time, region-specific COVID-19 data for each of our hospitals, the data scientists on our taskforce began compiling and automating an internal data framework which would be updated daily with state- and county-level case data using application programming interfaces from aggregated national COVID-19 data sources such as those provided by USAFACTS\n\n【109】<sup><a>16</a></sup>\n\n【110】US Coronavirus Cases and Deaths  \nUSAFACTS. 2020.\n\n【111】https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/\n\n【112】Date accessed: October 2, 2020\n\n【113】*   Google Scholar\n\n【114】and the _The New York Times_ .\n\n【115】<sup><a>17</a></sup>\n\n【116】Coronavirus (Covid-19) Data in the United States.

This dashboard provided the task force with one central location containing high-level, near–real-time summary visualizations from which to quickly surveil key COVID-19 parameters in each of our hospital regions.\n\n【121】In parallel with the CDT and test positivity dashboards described above, several task force members engaged with Mayo Clinic Hospital Incident Command System leadership to create a daily dashboard displaying internal hospital-specific metrics such as total tests ordered, total positive tests and test positivity rate, current hospital and ICU COVID-19–positive census, and cumulative COVID-19 admissions and inpatient fatalities. This COVID-19 leadership dashboard used data captured by the electronic health record (EHR) and was updated nightly; it is conceptually similar to COVID-19 dashboards recently described by other institutions.\n\n【122】<sup><a>18</a></sup>\n\n【123】*   Reeves J.J.\n*   Hollandsworth H.M.\n*   Torriani F.J.\n*   et al.\n\n【124】Rapid response to COVID-19: health informatics support for outbreak management in an academic health system.\n\n【125】_J Am Med Inform Assn._ 2020; 27 : 853-859\n\n【126】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (260)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【127】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【128】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【129】*   Grange E.S.\n*   Neil E.J.\n*   Stoffel M.\n*   et al.\n\n【130】Responding to COVID-19: The UW Medicine Information Technology Services Experience.\n\n【131】_Appl Clin Inform._ 2020; 11 : 265-275\n\n【132】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (99)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【133】Curation of a Centralized, EHR-Based Real-Time COVID-19 Data Mart\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【134】As we began to internally disseminate the dashboards described above, many clinicians, administrative leaders, and researchers across Mayo Clinic began to express a need to access COVID-19 data for various clinical, operational, and research initiatives, resulting in a significant amount of task force time spent responding to queries and sharing knowledge about the current COVID-19 data framework that the task force had developed. To facilitate, centralize, and operationalize COVID-19 analytics, a distinct COVID-19 data mart was built by Mayo Clinic’s Department of Data and Analytics to house formatted tables containing Mayo Clinic’s COVID-19 lab testing, hospital and ICU census data, and critical supply information (eg, mechanical ventilator status). The data mart build was agile and customizable based on task force feedback, with separate tables built for polymerase chain reaction testing, serology testing, and inpatient COVID-19 data. Key variables included test date/times, test results (including all positive, negative, indeterminate, and repeat tests), demographics (age, race, ethnicity, county/state of home address), bed type (ICU versus medical/surgical), status of mechanical ventilator use, and admit/discharge dates. The resulting COVID-19 data mart went live during the first month and continues to undergo refinement with additional tables and more real-time data from the EHR. This data mart exists within our unified data platform and contains easily queryable (using structured querying language) COVID-19 data. In addition to providing key information to inform predictive modeling efforts, the data mart has shown extended utility and is being used by many of the ongoing surveillance and research efforts at our institution.\n\n【135】Creation of Mayo Clinic Hospital–Specific Bayesian Predictive COVID-19 Census Models\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【136】The operationalization of the Mayo Clinic COVID-19 data mart provided reliable daily and real-time hospital and ICU census and test results. This resource, coupled with external COVID-19 data and metrics collated for the CDT and test positivity dashboard, made it possible to develop an internal predictive modeling solution through the application of machine learning by Mayo Clinic experts in Bayesian modeling. The internally developed model is a stochastic suspected, infected, recovered model\n\n【137】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【138】*   Kypraios T.\n*   O’Neill P.D.\n\n【139】Bayesian nonparametrics for stochastic epidemic models.\n\n【140】_Statist Sci._ 2018; 33 : 44-56\n\n【141】*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (11)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【142】for each US county updated daily with case counts. The infection rate driving the suspected, infected, recovered model can vary across county and time in a space-time correlated manner via a log-Gaussian process. The hospitalization rate for the counties in our health referral regions is trended over time and space, informed by state-level data, and refined with Mayo Clinic site-specific data. Floor/ICU length of stay distributions are informed by macro data and refined with Mayo Clinic site-specific data. Currently our model incorporates all of the following data sources: 1) case/test volumes over time from all US counties; 2) state level admission data over time; 3) Mayo Clinic site-specific admission data over time; 4) Minnesota Department of Health county-level hospitalizations over time; 5) Mayo Clinic site-specific ICU/floor discharge/transfer data from all Mayo Clinic sites; 6) daily mobility/social proximity measures in each county calculated from cell phone data by Unacast\n\n【143】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【144】Unacast 2020  \nUnacast Social Distancing Dataset.\n\n【145】https://www.unacast.com/data-for-good\n\n【146】*   Google Scholar\n\n【147】; and 7) dozens of studies from the literature to inform prior distributions. Predictions are made by simulating 500 possible futures (cases and hospitalizations) from the posterior distribution. Figure 1 shows a historical forecast from July 7, 2020, for hospital census at Mayo Clinic Rochester (floor and ICU) along with what actually happened for the next 4 weeks. The prediction distribution is represented in blue, while the actual observed data is in red. This modeling approach allowed our task force to provide more timely, flexible, and hospital-specific predictions compared with the external COVID-19 models we evaluated. For each of our hospitals, if the model predicted a greater than 30% chance of COVID-19 ICU census being greater than 50% of ICU bed capacity in the next 4 weeks, that hospital was given a red alert. If the model predicted that less than 10% of COVID-19 ICU census would be greater than 50% of ICU bed capacity in the next 4 weeks, that model was given a green status, while intermediate risks (10% to 30%) were given yellow warnings. A pre-formatted 20-slide PowerPoint presentation including alert levels, site-specific predictions, historical model accuracy summaries, and three to five brief key messages was e-mailed twice weekly to practice leadership at each of our hospitals.\n\n【148】Figure 1 Four-week historical forecast and performance of internally developed Bayesian coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) census model.

This democratic model of teamwork and communication is a well-established tradition of the Mayo Clinic practice,\n\n【152】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【153】*   Roberts P.\n\n【154】Total teamwork—the Mayo Clinic.\n\n【155】_Radiol Manage._ 1999; 21 ( 29-30, 32-29-30, 26 )\n\n【156】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【157】and the extension of this model to our predictive analytics task force facilitated the development of additional important work discussed below focused on the safety of our staff and hospitalized non–COVID-19 patients.\n\n【158】### Monitoring Usage and Availability of Personal Protective Equipment\n\n【159】Shortly after the pandemic began, personal protective equipment (PPE) became a central focus as a key consumable that was essential for the safety of patients and health care workers. The task force commissioned a subteam to model the PPE resources available to the institution. A two-pronged approach was taken for modeling PPE. First, the historical records maintained by institutional supply chain management were added to the COVID-19 data marts so that the data would be consumable by the applications. These data elements allowed for historical consumption rates to be tabulated for various face masks, gloves, eye protection, gowns, and other critical PPE stock. Next, detailed observational studies were initiated to empirically measure consumption rates for each PPE category per day, per patient, and per staff member. Finally, the estimated consumption rates were linked with model estimates to provide a prediction of how long current supplies would last based on projected volumes and inventory. As the pandemic continued, changes to PPE guidelines were factored into our modeling to update projected consumption.\n\n【160】Effectively messaging the predictions of supply on hand to the practice required pilot testing a variety of visuals. There was initial interest in having highly detailed counts, by site, of inventory, consumption, and time until critical shortages. However, because all Mayo Clinic sites work from a single inventory, a single dashboard was used to ensure an equitable distribution of PPE among all sites in the enterprise. Similar to the hospital and ICU COVID-19 census predictions, a simple red-yellow-green dashboard was created to convey status regarding the amount of supplies available ( Figure 2 ). As the pandemic progressed, detailed accounting of the supplies on hand, predictions made, and errors in predictions were tabulated. The internal development team used this information to refine the prediction models and add the necessary automation to the system to ensure accurate predictions were available to leadership.\n\n【161】Figure 2 Weekly dashboard showing modeled personal protective equipment supply on-hand (SOH) at Mayo Clinic.\n\n【162】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download Hi-res image\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【163】### Safety for Hospitalized Non–COVID-19 Patients\n\n【164】With flattened pandemic curves in our DMC regions becoming evident from our modeling in April 2020, (consistently <10% of hospital beds being used for COVID-19 patients), our hospital and procedural practices cautiously prepared to increase provision of non–COVID-19 care. However, whether patients presenting for non–COVID-19 care would be at risk of contracting COVID-19 in our facilities was of concern. Therefore, leadership widened the task force’s analytic scope to include monitoring patient safety related to COVID-19 by characterizing risk and rate of health care–associated infection in patients hospitalized for non-COVID indications at the three Mayo Clinic DMCs.\n\n【165】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【166】Habermann EH, Tande AJ, Pollock BD, et al.

The task force’s predictive COVID-19 census output was specifically cited by hospital leadership as a key piece of evidence which directly influenced their pre-emptive decision processes for changing visitation policies, planning for elective surgery reductions, projecting ICU, emergency department, and respiratory therapy staffing needs, coordinating staffing for expansion of testing and hospital bed capacities, and projecting the number of patients that could be enrolled in clinical trials.\n\n【170】The task force’s consistency also allowed a steady-state transition in its workload in several ways. First, the data governors were able to pass forward the operational management of the task force to administrative and clinical leadership of the Kern Center. Likewise, with key metric dashboards formatted and automated to update daily, task force members were able to converse more frequently over e-mail during plateau/low-spread months and reduce meeting frequency to “as necessary” when red-yellow-green alert status changed meaningfully in any of our hospital regions. As localized COVID-19 spikes occurred, such as those at our Arizona and Florida hospitals in July and our Midwest hospitals in November, the task force was able to rely on our surveillance dashboards and predictive modeling framework to identify increasing alert status and ramp-up meeting frequency and modeling updates until hospital COVID-19 census returned to a lower, non-alert status. The task force has documented its experience in a general framework ( Table 2 ) and now maintains a baseline steady-state of sentinel COVID-19 activity with minimum effort needed on an ongoing basis for model or metric development, but with the ability to rapidly and effectively re-engage with the practice using our standardized modeling and communication toolset as new COVID-19 peaks occur.\n\n【171】Table 2 Framework for the Formation of a Coronavirus Disease 2019 Predictive Analytic Task Force to Inform Hospital Operations\n\n【172】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【173】COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; EHR, electronic health record; ICU, intensive care unit.\n\n| 1\\.

Throughout the continually evolving pandemic, our task force has provided frequent and consistent summary messaging and insights that have helped the practice to anticipate and react to changing operational needs and opportunities, thus protecting our ability to care for all patients. Practice leadership has relied on the task force’s predictive output as an important data-driven tool in their arsenal for hospital census and quality management. We believe the framework shared here for the deployment of a COVID-19 predictive analytics task force could be adapted for effective implementation at other institutions to provide evidence-based messaging for operational decision-making. For hospitals without such a structure, immediate consideration may be warranted with COVID-19 models warning of a sustained third-wave through the winter of 2020–2021.\n\n【179】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【180】The Mayo Clinic COVID-19 Predictive Analytics Task Force contributors include the following: Kimberly Amrami, Robert Domnick, Ethan Heinzen, Karen Helfinstine, Ajay Jayakumar, Patrick Johnson, Camille Knepper, David Marcelletti, Mindy Mickelson, Ricardo Rojas, Mark St. George, Aaron Tande, Kelli Walvatne, and Phichet Wutthisirisart.\n\n【181】Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------\n\n【182】*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJiMDZiMDVmYmM0OGU3Yzg2YTQyMzEwNTk0NTA3ZmRjOCIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDA2MzU1fQ.OWJsx0mIJWYBjC\\_ARnthQ9-9IfUOE-bFOIBsD3hz-4vZUFgsyp06MPgr88T7t4l\\_VuOrqnBX\\_k6Yq1DxoX1vs4ZYSEeIGsBGSZug04guooV-I3TkCEf7ZDoLuDjooRbRc8qc6ayaBUHkkTdJm8onZFskhC3rf7sL8GZWt0bdyn0TJCRk4nZ8Ery3qJGIC1sls4ClD7fXdeCeBHoV\\_c2G1hfqQrERhhAbW13spCbJPeBdO9nM9ayIMIp0uX-tjXvtHEsPfV\\_106tWVeHeXpQNtGZnc1fhJ43Xp6kxZjDpP3maI9Xa8PuDKRSaMyz2AR5AGnuv4NGjAg9SPCsyRVkL7Q\n    \n    Download .mp4 (104.42 MB)\n    \n    Help with .mp4 files\n    \n    Video 1", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

But the antibacterial activity of penicillin was first discovered decades before Fleming's or Florey's work. Ernest A.C. Duchesne, a young military physician in Lyons, France, discovered penicillin in 1897 during a thesis project investigating antagonism between bacteria and fungi. On the advice of his mentor, Professor Gabriel Roux, Duchesne inoculated guinea pigs with various bacteria and then injected them with either the broth of a _Penicillium glaucum_ culture or saline. Most of the animals injected with the culture broth survived, while those given saline died. Duchesne's thesis was not noticed by the Institut Pasteur, and he entered the French Army and was unable to continue his research.\n\n【2】Penicillin remained unknown until Fleming left several bacterial culture plates on a laboratory bench, allegedly before leaving for his 1928 summer holiday. Fleming claimed that upon his return, he examined the culture plates and noted, “Around a large colony of a contaminating mold, the staphylococcus colonies became transparent and had obviously undergone lysis.” He subsequently carried out experiments with animals and then human conjunctivae, but had difficulty extracting adequate amounts of penicillin from culture and abandoned this work. Large-scale production of penicillin was developed by Florey and German-born British biochemist Ernst B. Chain more than a decade later.\n\n【3】Florey was born in Adelaide, South Australia, on September 26, 1898, the youngest of five children. His father was a manager for a shoe manufacturing company. Following education at St. Peters Collegiate School and the University of Adelaide, where he obtained his MBBS degree in 1921, Florey was selected as a Rhodes Scholar to Magdalen College at Oxford in 1922. In Oxford, he developed a close friendship with John Fulton, an American Rhodes Scholar. This friendship played an important role in the development of penicillin decades later.\n\n【4】Florey initially studied inflammation, including work on lysozyme and gastrointestinal secretion of mucus. He married a fellow medical student from Adelaide, Mary Ethel Reed, in 1926. Their daughter, Paquita, was so named because of his time in Spain studying nerve staining in the laboratory of Ramon y Cajal. An appointment in the Department of Pathology at Cambridge resulted in obtaining his PhD in 1927, with a dissertation on the physiology and pathology of the circulation of blood and lymph. He was appointed Chair of Pathology at the University of Sheffield in 1932 and two years later accepted the position of Chair of Pathology at Oxford.\n\n【5】Florey wanted to pursue biochemical work in his laboratory and hired Chain upon the recommendation of Frederick Gowland Hopkins, the Cambridge biochemist who was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1929 for co-discovery of vitamins. At Florey’s suggestion, Chain began studying lysozyme and in 1938 became aware of Fleming’s work on penicillin. After reproducing Duchesne's experiments in animals, Florey and Chain began making penicillin in porcelain vessels. The first patient treated with penicillin in January 1941 was an Oxford policeman with cellulitis, abscesses, and osteomyelitis due to a scratch from a rose thorn, who improved with drug therapy but relapsed when the supply of penicillin was exhausted. Five additional patients were treated over the next three months and the impressive results were reported by Florey in the _Lancet_ in August 1941. Florey approached a British pharmaceutical firm to make more penicillin but this was not possible during wartime in England.\n\n【6】Although Fleming had abandoned his work on penicillin years earlier, he heard via the grapevine that Florey was working on penicillin at Oxford so he visited his laboratory. He was graciously received by Florey and returned to London, but did not participate in further studies. Whereas Florey was abrasive or avoided the media, Fleming was always available to talk to the press, which almost led to Fleming receiving the Nobel Prize for penicillin alone.\n\n【7】Since it was not possible to produce enough penicillin for a clinical trial in England, Florey and a young English biochemist, Norman Heatley, traveled to the United States in June 1941. They visited Florey's old friend Fulton, who by then was a professor of physiology at Yale University. Since large fermentation tanks would be needed, Fulton made the connections necessary for Florey and Heatley to visit the Northern Regional Research Laboratory of the US Department of Agriculture in Peoria, Illinois. Utilizing a new fungal source from a spoiled cantaloupe in a Peoria market, new culture media and fermentation in large tanks resulted in the production of larger amounts of penicillin. The first patient to be treated with penicillin in the United States was Anne Sheafe Miller, wife of the Athletic Director at Yale. Her severe streptococcal sepsis was treated in March 1942, which resulted in a complete recovery. She lived until the age of 90.\n\n【8】Florey and his wife Ethel then conducted a successful clinical trial utilizing penicillin, and subsequently the drug became widely used in both civilian and military hospitals. Chain strongly advised obtaining a patent, but Florey emphasized that they should not be concerned with monetary awards and should make penicillin available for patients. He was knighted in 1944 and received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Fleming and Chain in 1945.\n\n【9】Subsequently, Florey became Provost of Queen’s College (Oxford) and relinquished his position as Chair of Pathology. He became President of the Royal Society in 1960 and was responsible for obtaining new quarters for the Society at Carleton House Terrace. He established the John Curtin School of Medical Research in the Australian National University in Canberra in 1965, the same year he was created Baron of Adelaide in Australia and Marston in England. He never lost his Australian accent and retained his emotional ties with his native country, despite living in England for more than four decades. Florey was known as a man of vision, energy, and persistence who also was modest and realistic about his abilities and honors. He said, “We had a bit of luck with penicillin−a great deal of luck.” He worked seven days weekly, and technicians were not anxious to work in his laboratory. He struggled against administrative duties and always wished to devote more time to laboratory research. To young investigators, he often seemed a remote and formidable figure.\n\n【10】His wife Ethel died in 1966, and the following year he married Margaret Jennings, who had worked in his laboratory for over 40 years. He became a heavy cigarette smoker during World War II and developed progressive angina during the last 18 years of his life. He died suddenly in Oxford on February 21, 1968, and was honored by a stamp issued by Australia in 1995 (Scott #1461D). Florey's portrait also appeared on the Australian $50 banknote from 1973-95.\n\n【11】Article info\n------------\n\n【12】### Identification\n\n【13】DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2014.12.028\n\n【14】### Copyright\n\n【15】© 2015 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

These therapies have been well tolerated. We describe a patient who was receiving such therapy and had development of temporally related and histologically confirmed severe pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity should be considered a potential serious complication of novel antiviral therapy for hepatitis C virus infection.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】DAA ( direct-acting antiviral agent ), DAD ( diffuse alveolar damage ), FDA ( Food and Drug Administration ), HCV ( hepatitis C virus ), LT ( liver transplant ), SIM ( simeprevir ), SOF ( sofosbuvir )\n\n【4】Historically, the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been difficult, particularly in patients with HCV genotype 1. Reasons for the difficulty include the inherent toxicity and limited efficacy of interferon-based therapy, which has been the cornerstone of anti-HCV efforts during the past 2 decades. Newly available direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) have the potential to dramatically improve HCV eradication rates.\n\n【5】Effective therapeutic options for patients infected with HCV have thus evolved rapidly over the past several years. In December 2013, 2 orally administered DAAs, simeprevir (SIM) and sofosbuvir (SOF), were approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HCV infection.\n\n【6】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【7】*   Chao D.\n*   Botwin G.J.\n*   Morgan T.R.\n\n【8】Update on recently approved treatments for hepatitis C.\n\n【9】_Curr Treat Options Gastroenterol._ 2014; 12 : 211-228\n\n【10】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【11】A third agent, ledipasvir and SOF (combined as a single pill), was approved by the FDA in October 2014 for HCV genotype 1.\n\n【12】Therapy with DAAs is becoming first-line treatment for HCV and is particularly considered for patients who are poor candidates for, or prior nonresponders to, interferon-based therapy. Two studied regimens include SOF plus ribavirin for 24 weeks and SOF and SIM for 12 weeks. The latter regimen—specifically, SOF, 400 mg once daily, plus SIM, 150 mg once daily, taken for 12 weeks—appears to achieve superior (90% or above) sustained virologic response rates based on results of the COSMOS (Combination of Simeprevir and Sofosbuvir in HCV Genotype 1 Infected Patients) study.\n\n【13】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【14】*   Jacobson I.M.\n*   Ghalib R.H.\n*   Rodriguez-Torres M.\n*   et al.\n\n【15】SVR results of a once-daily regimen of simeprevir (TMC435) plus sofosbuvir (GS-7977) with or without ribavirin in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic HCV genotype 1 treatment-naïve and prior null responder patients: the COSMOS study.\n\n【16】_Hepatology._ 2013; 58 ( Abstract LB-3 ) : 1379A\n\n【17】*   Google Scholar\n\n【18】Simeprevir-sofosbuvir also appears to be more cost-effective than SOF-ribavirin.\n\n【19】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【20】*   Hagan L.M.\n*   Sulkowski M.S.\n*   Schinazi R.F.\n\n【21】Cost analysis of sofosbuvir/ribavirin versus sofosbuvir/simeprevir for genotype 1 hepatitis C virus in interferon-ineligible/intolerant individuals.\n\n【22】_Hepatology._ 2014; 60 : 37-45\n\n【23】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (100)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【24】Trial results suggest that these newer agents have limited toxicity, with adverse events primarily being symptoms of fatigue, headache, and nausea.\n\n【25】Among patients who are actively viremic at the time of liver transplant (LT), reinfection of the new organ with HCV is universal.

A patient followed up at our institution had histologic evidence of aggressive recurrent HCV infection within 1 year of transplant, and therapy with DAAs was instituted. We report the subsequent fatal clinical course in which these drugs were temporally related to the development of severe pulmonary toxicity and evidence of drug-induced lung injury on surgical pathologic examination.\n\n【56】Report of a Case\n----------------\n\n【57】A 61-year-old man was diagnosed as having HCV infection 9 years before the current admission. He had smoked 2 packs of cigarettes daily from age 17 to 40 years. He underwent 4-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting 4 years before admission. His HCV infection progressed to cirrhosis and was complicated by ascites, encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma. His HCV had not been treated previously, and he was deemed too sick for therapy with interferon in the pretransplant setting.\n\n【58】Two years before admission, and 10 months before LT, pulmonary function testing revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 2.12 L (59%); forced vital capacity of 3.04 L (64%); and diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide of 16.95 mL/min/mm Hg (65%). Chest computed tomography revealed mild scattered fibrosis throughout both lungs and right upper lobe emphysema. The patient underwent chemoembolization of the hepatocellular carcinoma before LT, after which he had development of a large pleural effusion causing near opacification of the left hemithorax. This complication was addressed with thoracentesis and did not become a recurrent problem while the patient awaited LT.\n\n【59】The patient underwent live-donor liver transplant 14 months before admission for HCV-related cirrhosis complicated by hepatocellular carcinoma, which had been successfully treated before transplant. The explanted liver had no residual viable neoplasm. The donor was positive for hepatitis B core antibody. The patient was treated postoperatively with mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone, tacrolimus, and entecavir. A biliary stricture developed 2 months after LT and was treated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography–placed biliary stenting. Nine months before the current admission, the mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued and the other medications were continued.\n\n【60】Six months before admission, the patient noted some increased dyspnea on exertion. Repeated coronary angiography revealed patent coronary grafts and normal pulmonary artery pressure, and chest radiography documented normal heart size and pulmonary vascularity with no effusions or edema and scarring in the apices that was unchanged compared with previous chest radiography. Pulmonary function tests revealed a forced expiratory volume in 1 second of 2.91 L (77%); forced vital capacity of 3.62 L (77%); and diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide of 14.69 mL/min/mm Hg (57%). Resting oxygen saturation was 99%, which did not change with exercise. His dyspnea was attributed to chronic lung disease secondary to cigarette smoking.\n\n【61】Three months before admission, the patient had increasing values on liver blood tests and an increasing level of HCV viremia. Liver biopsy was performed and revealed features of aggressive recurrent HCV infection including bridging fibrosis. The clinical impression was fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis. We decided to pursue interferon-free therapy given concerns about the patient’s ability to tolerate expected adverse effects, including his stated aversion to interferon when informed of its adverse effect potential. His HCV genotype was 1a. Given therapies available at the time, we elected to treat our patient with SIM, 150 mg/d, plus SOF, 400 mg/d.\n\n【62】Within 2 weeks of admission, SIM-SOF treatment was initiated. Within several days, the patient began to experience fever, cough, and dyspnea and ultimately came to the emergency department. Admission chest radiography documented patchy bilateral lung opacities, and chest computed tomography revealed mild diffuse emphysema with ground-glass opacities throughout both lungs but sparing the periphery ( Figure 1 ). There were also some fine reticular opacities in the upper lobes with normal pulmonary vascularity, which were new findings compared with previous examinations. Simprevir-SOF was immediately discontinued on admission.\n\n【63】Figure 1 Diffuse ground-glass opacities on computed tomography of the chest.\n\n【64】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【65】The patient underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage; transbronchial biopsies were not performed. There was no evidence of an infectious process from microbiologic analysis of the fluid, including negative results for _Pneumocystis jiroveci_ pneumonia, viral cultures, and polymerase chain reaction studies for cytomegalovirus, and a respiratory virus panel. The bronchoalveolar lavage cellular differential was 5% eosinophils, 40% lymphocytes, 7% polymorphonuclear lymphocytes, and 48% alveolar macrophages. The patient’s condition deteriorated, and he required 100% oxygen by face mask and underwent surgical lung biopsy. Pathologic review of the specimen revealed organizing diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with scattered intra-alveolar eosinophils and diffuse cellular microvesicular changes compatible with drug/medication toxicity. Stains for organisms and cultures of the surgical specimen, including viral culture, were negative for infection. He was then treated with high doses of corticosteroids (methylprednisolone sodium succinate, 125 mg every 6 hours). There was transient improvement in oxygenation; however, over the next several days, his respiratory status declined, and he required intubation and mechanical ventilation. High-dose corticosteroids and lung protective mechanical ventilation were continued, but despite these interventions, his clinical status deteriorated. The radiographic infiltrates persisted, his clinical course was complicated by the development of a pneumothorax that required chest tube placement, and 9 days after his surgical lung biopsy, the patient died.\n\n【66】Discussion\n----------\n\n【67】We describe a patient who had development of severe lung injury soon after initiating treatment with SIM and SOF. The temporal association of the initiation of SIM and SOF with this patient’s rapidly developing and progressive respiratory failure suggests a causative role. The pathologic findings on surgical lung biopsy were suggestive of drug-induced lung injury. Extensive testing for an infectious pathogen was performed because the patient was immunosuppressed; however, these studies yielded negative results, including cultures of lung tissue. The other medications the patient was receiving at that time (tacrolimus and entecavir) had been tolerated for over 1 year and thus had no temporal association with the onset of the patient’s respiratory failure. Furthermore, neither tacrolimus nor entecavir are commonly associated with respiratory complications.\n\n【68】The surgical lung biopsy revealed organizing DAD with scattered intra-alveolar eosinophils and cytoplasmic microvesicular alterations in reactive type 2 cells and alveolar macrophages, suggesting drug toxicity ( Figure 2 ). DAD is a histopathologic finding that can be seen in patients with a variety of disorders, with infection being reported to be the most common and drug toxicity being a cause in 10% of cases.\n\n【69】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【70】*   Parambil J.G.\n*   Myers J.L.\n*   Aubry M.C.\n*   Ryu J.H.\n\n【71】Causes and prognosis of diffuse alveolar damage diagnosed on surgical lung biopsy.\n\n【72】_Chest._ 2007; 132 : 50-57\n\n【73】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (115)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【74】Chemotherapeutic agents are the drugs most commonly associated with the development of DAD; however, this pattern has been noted to occur rarely with a large number of agents. Other possible causes of DAD, such as underlying connective tissue disorder or an exacerbation of an interstitial lung disorder, were not supported by any clinical findings in this patient. The patient did have abnormalities on previous radiographic studies and pulmonary function tests, but those abnormalities could be explained by his history of cigarette smoking, his cardiac surgery, and the presence of a large pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis before LT. These conditions could perhaps have also made this patient more prone to the development of drug-induced lung injury. The fact that the patient rapidly became markedly symptomatic within days of beginning the antiviral therapy and the surgical pathologic findings suggesting drug-induced lung injury make the antiviral agents the most likely etiology of this patient’s clinical course of lung injury and respiratory failure.\n\n【75】Figure 2 Simeprevir-sofosbuvir–related diffuse alveolar damage. A, Diffuse alveolar damage is evident in the surgical lung biopsy specimen, with hyaline membranes (hm) readily visible. The process was not uniform, with spared areas visible (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×100). B, At higher magnification, intensely vacuolated type 2 cells and macrophages (v) are present with scattered intra-alveolar eosinophils (arrow).

Our patient had severe lung injury with respiratory failure that developed very rapidly after initiating therapy with SIM and SOF. The lung injury did not respond to corticosteroid therapy and led to the patient’s death. It is possible that his respiratory deterioration could have been secondary to the surgical biopsy, but there was no evidence of persistent air leak, and the disease progression continued to be bilateral and symmetric on radiography. The mechanism of pulmonary injury in this case is unknown, and although this is not definitive evidence of causation, the temporal association, surgical lung biopsy findings, and lack of explanatory infectious agents despite extensive work-up all point to drug-induced lung injury. Whether SIM, SOF, or the combination of both drugs is the causative factor is similarly unknown.\n\n【102】Conclusion\n----------\n\n【103】We report a case of severe lung injury that developed rapidly after initiation of therapy with DAAs for HCV infection. As a result of this case, close scrutiny for pulmonary toxicity should be maintained when using novel DAAs in HCV-infected patients, particularly among patients receiving SIM and/or SOF. This caution is further warranted given the increasing number of patients who will likely receive DAAs in the coming years.\n\n【104】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【105】All of the authors participated in the care of the patient and contributed substantially to the development of the submitted manuscript.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

The survey was administered online November 6 through December 6, 2019, to a validated panel of HCPs drawn from US national databases and professional organizations. The final analysis sample included 779 primary care clinicians (PCCs) and 159 gastroenterologists (GIs).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】HCPs chose colonoscopy as their preferred screening method for average-risk patients (96.9% (154/159) for GIs, 75.7% (590/779) for PCCs). Among PCCs, 12.2% (95/779) preferred multi-target stool DNA (mt-sDNA), followed by fecal immunochemical test (FIT), (7.3%; 57/779) and guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) (4.8%; 37/779). Preference among PCCs and GIs generally shifted toward noninvasive screening options for patients who were unable to undergo invasive procedures; concerned about taking time from work; unconvinced about need for screening; and refusing other screening recommendations. Among PCCs, preference for mt-sDNA over FIT and gFOBT was less frequent in larger compared with smaller clinical practices. Additionally, preference for mt-sDNA over FIT was more likely among PCCs with more years of clinical experience, higher patient volumes (> 25/day), and practice locations in suburban and rural settings (compared to urban).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Both PCCs and GIs preferred colonoscopy for CRC screening of average-risk patients, although PCCs did so less frequently and with approximately a quarter preferring stool-based tests (particularly mt-sDNA). PCCs’ preference varied by provider and patient characteristics. Our findings underscore the importance of informed choice and shared decision-making about CRC screening options.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】CRC ( colorectal cancer ), FIT ( fecal immunochemical test ), gFOBT ( guaiac-based fecal occult blood test ), HCP ( health care provider ), mt-sDNA ( multi-target stool DNA ), OR ( odds ratio ), PCC ( primary care clinician ), USPSTF ( United States Preventive Services Task Force )\n\n【11】In the United States, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most frequent cause of cancer-related death.\n\n【12】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【13】U.S. Cancer Statistics Working Group.

HCPs consent to participate in the panel, are asked to complete a profile, and their data is integrated with the American Medical Association and National Provider Identifier databases to inform matches between providers and survey invitations.\n\n【175】### Sample\n\n【176】Surveys were sent via email to 3299 PCCs and 538 GIs. Up to two reminders were sent to nonresponders within a 21-day period. Surveys were completed by 779 PCCs (internal medicine n=403; family medicine n=376) and 159 GIs. The survey completion rate for PCCs was 25.3% and for GIs was 29.6%. All participants received remuneration for completing the survey; per the standard remuneration practices of Dynata, based on fair market compensation rates, PCCs received $39, whereas GIs received $51.\n\n【177】### Analysis\n\n【178】All data were analyzed using SAS version 9.4. Respondents who indicated that they do not recommend CRC screening to their average-risk patients (n=5), and those who indicated no preference or a primary preference other than colonoscopy, mt-sDNA, FIT, or gFOBT, for average-risk patients (n=42), were excluded from further analyses because other screening options are rarely used in clinical practice and only a small percentage of all respondents selected each alternative modality (<1%).\n\n【179】Frequencies for provider and clinical practice characteristics were calculated and summarized separately for PCCs and GIs. Cross-tabulation with a χ <sup>2 </sup> test was used to assess differences in CRC screening test preferences between PCCs and GIs by provider and clinical practice characteristics ( _P_ <.05). Separately for PCCs and GIs, CRC screening preference by patient characteristics was summarized as direct visualization modalities (eg, colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy) or noninvasive modalities (eg, stool-based tests and computed tomography colonography). Among PCCs, we conducted a multinomial regression analysis to evaluate provider characteristics (eg, board certification, clinical degree, and years in practice) and practice characteristics (eg, patient volume, clinical practice size, and rural/urban status) associated with CRC screening preference among stool-based tests (eg, FIT, gFOBT, and mt-sDNA), controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. Results of the multinomial model, presented as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs, summarize the odds of preferring mt-sDNA over FIT and the odds of preferring mt-sDNA over gFOBT, separately.\n\n【180】Results\n-------\n\n【181】### Sociodemographic, Provider, and Practice Characteristics\n\n【182】As summarized in Table 1 , most PCCs were aged 50 years or older (56.0%; 436/777), male (72.5%; 563/779), White, non-Hispanic (66.2%; 516/779), and earned $200,000 or more annually (57.4%; 447/779). Only three of the PCCs were advanced practice providers (eg, nurse practitioners or physician assistants) whereas the remaining were physicians. The majority of PCCs reported practicing medicine at least 20 years postresidency (52.4%; 408/779), working in clinics with fewer than 16 clinicians (73.4%; 572/779), and characterized their clinical practice as being in a suburban (54.6%; 425/779) or urban (32.0%; 249/779) location. The majority of PCCs reported seeing, on average, 20 or fewer patients per day (56.0%; 436/779).\n\n【183】Table 1 Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of the Survey Participants by Clinical Specialty\n\n【184】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【185】Values are n (%).\n\n|  | Primary carebIncludes Internal Medicine and Family Medicine.(n=779) | Gastroenterology (n=159) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Age, years |  |  |\n| 27-39 | 103 (13.2) | 41 (25.8) |\n| 40-49 | 240 (30.8) | 42 (26.4) |\n| 50-60 | 254 (32.6) | 45 (28.3) |\n| 60+ | 182 (23.4) | 31 (19.5) |\n| SexcNumbers do not always add to total due to missing responses. |  |  |\n| Male | 563 (72.5) | 131 (82.9) |\n| Female | 214 (27.5) | 27 (17.1) |\n| Race/ethnicity |  |  |\n| White, non-Hispanic | 516 (66.2) | 88 (55.4) |\n| Black, non-Hispanic | 16 (2.1) | 4 (2.5) |\n| Hispanic | 25 (3.2) | 10 (6.3) |\n| Asian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic | 185 (23.8) | 42 (26.4) |\n| Other/Multiple Race, non-Hispanic | 37 (4.8) | 15 (9.4) |\n| Annual household income |  |  |\n| Less than $74,999 | 41 (5.3) | 4 (2.5) |\n| $75,000 to $124,999 | 95 (12.2) | 9 (5.7) |\n| $125,000 to $174,999 | 113 (14.5) | 12 (7.6) |\n| $175,000 to $199,999 | 83 (10.7) | 16 (10.1) |\n| $200,000 or more | 447 (57.4) | 118 (74.2) |\n| Board certification |  |  |\n| Internal medicine | 403 (51.7) | — |\n| Family medicine | 376 (48.3) | — |\n| Gastroenterology | 0 | 159 (100) |\n| Clinical degree |  |  |\n| Physician (MD, DO, MMS) | 776 (99.6) | 159 (100) |\n| Advanced practice provider (PA/NP) | 3 (0.4) | — |\n| Number of years practicing medicine post-residency |  |  |\n| 0-9 | 112 (14.4) | 42 (26.4) |\n| 10-19 | 259 (33.3) | 53 (33.3) |\n| 20-29 | 264 (33.9) | 45 (28.3) |\n| 30+ | 144 (18.5) | 19 (12.0) |\n| Average number of patients seen on typical day |  |  |\n| 0-15 | 156 (20.0) | 41 (25.8) |\n| 16-20 | 280 (35.9) | 49 (30.8) |\n| 21-25 | 181 (23.2) | 30 (18.9) |\n| 26+ | 162 (20.8) | 39 (24.5) |\n| Number of clinicians in practice |  |  |\n| 0-15 | 572 (73.4) | 103 (64.8) |\n| 16+ | 207 (26.6) | 56 (35.2) |\n| Characterization of clinical practice location |  |  |\n| Urban | 249 (32.0) | 81 (50.9) |\n| Suburban | 425 (54.6) | 69 (43.4) |\n| Rural | 105 (13.5) | 9 (5.7) |\n\n【187】a Values are n (%).\n\n【188】b Includes Internal Medicine and Family Medicine.\n\n【189】c Numbers do not always add to total due to missing responses.\n\n【190】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【191】Most GIs were younger than 50 years of age (52.2%; 83/159), male (82.9%; 131/158), White, non-Hispanic (55.4%; 88/159), and earned $200,000 or more annually (74.2%; 118/159). The majority of GIs reported practicing medicine fewer than 20 years postresidency (59.7%; 95/159), working in clinics with fewer than 16 clinicians (64.8%; 103/159), and characterized their clinical practice as being in an urban (50.9%; 81/159) or suburban (43.4%; 69/159) location.

Among PCCs, 12.2% (95/779) selected mt-sDNA as their second most preferred CRC screening test, followed by FIT (7.3%; 57/779) and gFOBT (4.8%; 37/779). Only 3.2% (5/159) of GIs selected a stool-based test as their preferred modality for their average-risk patients. Although PCCs overwhelmingly preferred colonoscopy over stool-based tests, no significant differences in preference for colonoscopy compared with stool-based tests were observed sociodemographic and clinical characteristics among PCCs ( Table 3 ).\n\n【194】Table 2 Preference for Colorectal Cancer Screening Test by Health Care Provider Board Certification\n\n【195】<sup>a</sup>\n\n【196】CRC, colorectal cancer; FIT, fecal immunochemical test; gFOBT, guaiac-based fecal occult blood test; mt-sDNA, multitarget stool DNA.\n\n| Preferred CRC screening method for average-risk patients | Clinical specialty/board certification, n (%) | _P_ |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Primary carebIncludes Internal Medicine and Family Medicine.(n=779) | Gastroenterology (n=159) |\n| --- | --- |\n| gFOBT | 37 (4.8) | 0 |  |\n| FIT | 57 (7.3) | 3 (1.9) |  |\n| mt-sDNA | 95 (12.2) | 2 (1.3) |  |\n| Colonoscopy | 590 (75.7) | 154 (96.9) |  |\n\n【198】a CRC, colorectal cancer; FIT, fecal immunochemical test; gFOBT, guaiac-based fecal occult blood test; mt-sDNA, multitarget stool DNA.\n\n【199】b Includes Internal Medicine and Family Medicine.\n\n【200】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【201】Table 3 Primary Care Clinician Preference for Colonoscopy Over Stool-Based Tests for Average-Risk Patients by Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics\n\n|  | Primary care clinicians,aIncludes Internal Medicine and Family Medicine.n (%) | _P_ |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Prefer Stool-Based (N=189) | Prefer Colonoscopy (N=590) |\n| --- | --- |\n| Age in years |  |  | .6748 |\n| 27-39 | 24 (12.7) | 79 (13.4) |  |\n| 40-49 | 58 (30.7) | 182 (30.9) |  |\n| 50-60 | 57 (30.2) | 197 (33.4) |  |\n| \\>60 | 50 (26.5) | 132 (22.4) |  |\n| Sex |  |  | .094 |\n| Male | 128 (67.7) | 435 (74.0) |  |\n| Female | 61 (32.3) | 153 (26.0) |  |\n| Race/ethnicity |  |  | .6466 |\n| White, non-Hispanic | 123 (65.1) | 393 (66.6) |  |\n| Black, non-Hispanic | 4 (2.1) | 12 (2.0) |  |\n| Hispanic | 7 (3.7) | 18 (3.05) |  |\n| Asian/Pacific Islander, non-Hispanic | 50 (26.5) | 135 (22.9) |  |\n| Other/Multiple Race, non-Hispanic | 5 (2.7) | 32 (5.4) |  |\n| Annual household income |  |  | .2227 |\n| Less than $74,999 | 11 (5.8) | 30 (5.1) |  |\n| $75,000 to $124,999 | 27 (14.3) | 68 (11.5) |  |\n| $125,000 to $174,999 | 35 (18.5) | 78 (13.2) |  |\n| $175,000 to $199,999 | 20 (10.6) | 63 (10.7) |  |\n| $200,000 or more | 96 (50.8) | 351 (59.5) |  |\n| Board certification |  |  | .4244 |\n| Internal medicine | 93 (49.2) | 310 (52.5) |  |\n| Family medicine | 96 (50.8) | 280 (47.5) |  |\n| Gastroenterology |  |  |  |\n| Number of years practicing medicine post-residency |  |  | .6252 |\n| 0-9 | 22 (11.6) | 90 (15.3) |  |\n| 10-19 | 65 (34.4) | 194 (32.9) |  |\n| 20-29 | 64 (33.9) | 200 (33.9) |  |\n| 30+ | 38 (20.1) | 106 (18.0) |  |\n| Average number of patients seen on typical day |  |  | .4753 |\n| 0-15 | 31 (16.4) | 125 (21.2) |  |\n| 16-20 | 70 (37.0) | 210 (35.6) |  |\n| 21-25 | 49 (25.9) | 132 (22.4) |  |\n| \\>25 | 39 (20.6) | 123 (20.9) |  |\n| Number of clinicians in practice |  |  | .8830 |\n| 0-15 | 138 (73.0) | 434 (73.6) |  |\n| 16+ | 51 (27.0) | 156 (26.4) |  |\n| Characterization of clinical practice location |  |  | .6353 |\n| Urban | 64 (33.9) | 185 (31.4) |  |\n| Suburban | 103 (54.5) | 322 (54.6) |  |\n| Rural | 22 (11.6) | 83 (14.1) |  |\n\n【203】a Includes Internal Medicine and Family Medicine.\n\n【204】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【205】In general, CRC screening modality preference by patient characteristics mirrored their overall preference for average-risk patients among both PCCs and GIs ( Table 4 ).

A similar pattern was observed in the likelihood of preferring mt-sDNA over FIT (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.36).

Furthermore, preference for colonoscopy versus stool-based tests did not differ significantly by clinician experience and clinical practice characteristics. These results reveal considerable homogeneity in CRC screening preferences among the HCP respondents, particularly GIs. Previous research has suggested that the common practice of recommending colonoscopy may actually reduce adherence to CRC screening, particularly among racial/ethnic minorities, and that offering stool-based screening or a choice of either stool-based screening or colonoscopy is associated with greater adherence.\n\n【230】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【231】*   Inadomi J.M.\n*   Vijan S.\n*   Janz N.K.\n*   et al.\n\n【232】Adherence to colorectal cancer screening: a randomized clinical trial of competing strategies.\n\n【233】_Arch Intern Med._ 2012; 172 : 575-582\n\n【234】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (420)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【235】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【236】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【237】*   Liang P.S.\n*   Wheat C.L.\n*   Abhat A.\n*   et al.\n\n【238】Adherence to competing strategies for colorectal cancer screening over 3 years.\n\n【239】_Am J Gastroenterol._ 2016; 111 : 105-114\n\n【240】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (79)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【241】Although preference for CRC screening options by various patient characteristics largely mirrored the overall preference for colonoscopy among PCCs and GIs, preference shifted to stool-based tests for patients facing barriers to screening, including inability to undergo an invasive procedure, concerns about taking time away from work, uncertainty about the need to get screened, and refusal of other screening recommendations. The availability and recommendation of multiple CRC screening modalities with differences in effectiveness, cost, risk, and patient acceptability highlights the critical need for HCPs to provide patients with accurate information about all available options to support informed choice and shared decision-making.

Her condition quickly deteriorated into cardiogenic shock with ventricular arrhythmia. Despite revascularization of the left anterior descending artery and intravenous inotrope and antiarrhythmic therapy, her unstable hemodynamics and arrhythmias persisted. Early emergency initiation of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) led to prompt hemodynamic and rhythm stability; however, adequate endogenous cardiac output did not ensue, and she was not able to be weaned from ECMO until hospital day 8. She subsequently recovered and continues to do well in the outpatient setting. This case demonstrates the remarkable hemodynamic and rhythm stability that early initiation of ECMO can provide in the setting of unstable myocardial infarction.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】CPR ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation ), ECMO ( extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ), IABP ( intra-aortic balloon pump ), LAD ( left anterior descending ), LM ( left main ), MI ( myocardial infarction )\n\n【4】During acute myocardial infarction (MI), cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias may persist despite revascularization and maximal medical and intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) support. We present the case of a woman with ST-elevation MI who, despite successful and prompt percutaneous intervention, continued to remain electrically and hemodynamically unstable despite repeated defibrillation, intravenous antiarrhythmic inotropic drugs, and use of an IABP. Emergency establishment of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) led to immediate electrical and hemodynamic improvement with subsequent patient survival and recovery. From this experience, we demonstrate that ECMO can be a lifesaving approach in the catheterization laboratory for emergency treatment of patients with cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias due to acute MI; thus, ECMO should be considered early during resuscitation.\n\n【5】Report of a Case\n----------------\n\n【6】A previously healthy 46-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a 28-hour history of acute-onset chest pressure and dyspnea.

Left coronary angiography revealed mobile thrombus in the left main (LM) coronary artery, 100% ostial occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, and thrombus embolization into the circumflex artery ( Figure 2 and Supplemental Video 1 \\[available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org \\]). The LM and LAD arteries were treated with aspiration thrombectomy and angioplasty with restoration of perfusion to the LM and mid-LAD arteries ( Figure 3 and Supplemental Video 2 \\[available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org \\]). Intravenous eptifibatide therapy was also initiated during the intervention to maximize platelet inhibition.\n\n【17】Figure 2 Right anterior oblique caudal view of the left coronary system with thrombus noted in the distal left main artery (arrow), and an occluded left anterior descending artery and thrombus in the obtuse marginal branch of the circumflex artery (hatched arrow).\n\n【18】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【19】Figure 3 Right anterior oblique cranial view of the left coronary system with an intracoronary wire placed in the previously occluded left anterior descending artery and improved perfusion.\n\n【20】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【21】Throughout the procedure, the patient required cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for recurrent cardiac arrest and received a total of 10 shocks for recurrent ventricular arrhythmias. Adequacy of chest compressions throughout the resuscitation were assessed by arterial waveforms monitored via a catheter in the right femoral artery. To prevent fatigue while performing CPR, causing a deterioration in CPR efficacy, chest compressors were changed at 2-minute intervals during brief rhythm analysis or when chest compression cadence decreased below 100/min. The patient's profound electrical and hemodynamic instability persisted despite administration of amiodarone, vasopressin, intravenous epinephrine, and the placement of an IABP. Severe pulmonary vascular congestion and pulmonary edema, as evidenced in the anesthesia circuit, contributed to her persistent hypoxemia.\n\n【22】Advanced percutaneous left ventricular assist devices were considered for circulatory support but not used out of concern that they might not have provided the immediate improvement in oxygenation or increase in cardiac output necessary to protect neurologic and myocardial viability. Instead, a venoarterial ECMO system was placed via the right femoral artery and vein. The vein was cannulated with a 25F cannula that extended into the right atrium, and the artery was cannulated with a 17F cannula. Serial vascular dilators were used to enable percutaneous placement of these large-caliber cannulas. Immediate pre-ECMO arterial blood analysis revealed a pH of 6.82 and a base deficit of less than −25 mmol/L. Initiation of ECMO led to immediate electrical and hemodynamic stability, and no further CPR was required. However, IABP support was continued to improve diastolic perfusion of the coronary arteries. Initial echocardiography demonstrated a left ventricular ejection fraction of 10%. Figure 4 demonstrates the documented course of events from arrival in the catheterization laboratory.\n\n【23】Figure 4 Timeline of events after the patient's arrival to the catheterization laboratory (cath lab).

She demonstrated progressive neurologic recovery and awoke at 24 hours. Her hemodynamics improved during the subsequent week but not enough that ECMO could be discontinued. Her peak creatine kinase–MB level was 358 ng/mL (reference range, <3.8 ng/mL) (to convert to μg/L, multiply by 1), and her peak troponin level was 12.6 ng/mL. She was successfully weaned from ECMO on day 8, and low-dose epinephrine and vasopressin were continued as intravenous infusions. She had minimal bleeding but no other ECMO-associated complications. The IABP was continued while she was receiving ECMO to increase blood flow to the coronary arteries and brain and to counteract the increased afterload effects of ECMO. The IABP was removed on day 9, and she was extubated soon after. Her subsequent hospital course was complicated by a pulmonary embolism and splenic vein thrombosis. Gastrointestinal bleeding and the presence of a thrombotic mass in her ascending colon necessitated a partial colectomy with benign disease documented on pathology. Dilation and curettage were also performed for endometrial thickening. Thrombophilia and hematology evaluation suggested that she had an acquired thrombophilia due to thrombocytosis secondary to iron deficiency anemia. We speculate that her coronary thrombi were likely formed at the site of an unstable atherosclerotic lesion in the ostium of the LAD artery, with fragments subsequently embolizing within the circumflex artery. She was discharged from the hospital 30 days after her MI with intact neurologic status, and she continues to do well as an outpatient (last assessed in January 2013). At her last echocardiogram evaluation 2 months after her event, the left ventricular ejection fraction was 30% to 35%.\n\n【26】Discussion\n----------\n\n【27】Cardiogenic shock related to ongoing MI that persists despite revascularization may lead to subsequent multiorgan failure. Injured myocardium may retain substantial viability after successful revascularization, but functional recovery often lags by several days, thereby necessitating extrinsic hemodynamic support. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines recommend placement of an IABP in the setting of cardiogenic shock or ischemia-related intractable ventricular arrhythmias (Class IIa, Level of Evidence of B).\n\n【28】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【29】*   Antman E.M.\n*   Anbe D.T.\n*   Armstrong P.W.\n*   et al.\n\n【30】ACC/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction—executive summary: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines (Writing Committee to Revise the 1999 Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Acute Myocardial Infarction).\n\n【31】_Circulation._ 2004; 110 ( \\[published correction appears in Circulation. 2005;111(15):2013\\] ) : 588-636\n\n【32】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1362)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【33】However, in the patient we described, pharmacologic therapy and insertion of an IABP failed to resolve the life-threatening, persistent cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias after coronary revascularization. Instead, we relied on ECMO as a bridge therapy to sustain hemodynamics until the patient’s heart fully recovered. This case is unique in that ECMO was considered early and initiated effectively in the catheterization laboratory, resulting in immediate hemodynamic and rhythm stability. Given the severity of metabolic abnormality, the degree of hypoxemia with fulminant pulmonary edema, and the prolonged duration of CPR, one would not have predicted whether a full recovery was possible, and termination of resuscitation would have been justified. Our experience with the inadequacy of the IABP support is consistent with the recent Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock (SHOCK) II trial, which failed to demonstrate significant reduction in 30-day mortality in patients with acute MI and cardiogenic shock treated with an IABP placement.\n\n【34】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【35】*   Thiele H.\n*   Zeymer U.\n*   Neumann F.\n*   et al.\n\n【36】Intraaortic balloon support for myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock.\n\n【37】_N Engl J Med._ 2012; 367 : 1287-1296\n\n【38】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1722)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【39】Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can provide oxygenation and circulatory support and may have a distinct advantage over purely hemodynamic support devices, especially in the setting of persistent hypoxemia and severely reduced cardiac function.

In our case, ECMO resolved the patient's ventricular arrhythmia and stabilized her hemodynamics until cardiac recovery. At 4 months after MI, the patient was asymptomatic and had a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30% to 35%. When available in the catheterization laboratory for emergency use, ECMO may serve as an ancillary lifesaving measure for patients with cardiogenic shock and refractory ventricular arrhythmias in the setting of an acute MI. Moreover, it should be considered early during the resuscitative efforts to optimize potential benefit, including the stabilization of arrhythmias and limiting additional organ injury.\n\n【81】Supplemental Online Material\n----------------------------\n\n【82】*   eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIxYzA4YmI2NDYxNGIyMjI3OGVjMTQ4MjFiZTY2ODkzYSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjkyMDIzMzMxfQ.aaBqe62siZw8uQXEnZQq6u653F\\_J2sYKaNi7hB2EpqFCTVjzNAtuh9kdnBqAxgcf6hiAVEOb7gBjC\\_SMPDTcmj9jztHspy8CahXAO88xIwehijt1VJI81KHA96wn6NjY6shMGUBoJqMWIVTSG5UIdn5w8uJrvEtTzogJVXIwkRi5ubB\\_1xl2jq1bz4P6e3ezLdIU1c8JnqAHsLw4iUublAt4oKXd3Hk\\_lWZtWY3RwwlxBYRkr7RckYdXYVMs\\_P9d9bluEvEsqIWDiplVpIgB00oGpCFZXiN-iXFYMoK9Vt500jZxVOO4OlSq-fzZ\\_5fZnIYrp9P7arhKSNp85Rwdgg\n    \n    Download .mp4 (0.56 MB)\n    \n    Help with .mp4 files\n    \n    Supplemental Video 1\n    \n    Angiogram of presenting coronary occlusion.

Using a text search of radiologists’ notes for 2402 individuals (median age, 75.0 years) who underwent imaging between August 10, 2005, and July 31, 2014, we identified 52 patients (2.2%) who had at least one meningioma. We estimated the association of selected risk factors with the presence of meningioma using odds ratios and 95% CIs from logistic regression models adjusted for age and sex. Based on these results, we moved the most significant variables forward to a multivariable model.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Controlling for age and sex, significant associations with the presence of meningioma included higher body mass index (odds ratio \\[OR\\], 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; _P_ \\=.03), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (OR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.13-3.95; _P_ \\=.02), aspirin (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.05-3.46; _P_ \\=.04), and blood pressure–lowering medication (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.06-3.99; _P_ \\=.03). Lower risk was associated with male sex (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29-0.90; _P_ \\=.02), coronary artery disease (OR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.97; _P_ \\=.04), and higher self-reported anxiety (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.98; _P_ \\=.02). Simultaneous adjustment for all of these factors except aspirin in a multivariable model did not attenuate these associations (concordance, 0.71).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In a population-based sample of 2402 participants, 52 (2.2%) had an incidental meningioma. They were more likely to be female and have higher body mass index. Meningioma was also associated with certain medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and blood pressure–lowering medications) and inversely with anxiety and coronary artery disease.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】BP ( blood pressure ), BMI ( body mass index ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), HRT ( hormone replacement therapy ), MCSA ( Mayo Clinic Study of Aging ), NSAID ( nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ), OR ( odds ratio )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

Main outcome measures were hospitalizations for opioid overdose, near-fatal events (overdose involving mechanical ventilation), and hospital charges during the year after the first ED visit.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】The analytic cohort comprised 19,831 unique patients with 21,609 ED visits for opioid overdose. During a 1-year period, 7% (95% CI, 7%-7%; n=1389 patients) of the patients had frequent (2 or more) ED visits, accounting for 15% (95% CI, 14%-15%; n=3167) of all opioid overdose ED visits. Middle age, male sex, public insurance, lower household income, and comorbidities (such as chronic pulmonary disease and neurological diseases) were associated with frequent ED visits (all _P_ <.01). Overall, 53% (95% CI, 52%-54%; n=11,412) of the ED visits for opioid overdose resulted in hospitalizations; patients with frequent ED visits for opioid overdose had a higher likelihood of hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio, 3.98; 95% CI, 3.38-4.69). In addition, 10.0% (95% CI, 10%-10%; n=2161) of the ED visits led to near-fatal events; patients with frequent ED visits had a higher likelihood of a near-fatal event (adjusted odds ratio, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.96-2.66). Total charges in Florida were $208 million (95% CI, $200-$219 million).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In this population-based cohort, we found that frequent ED visits for opioid overdose were associated with a higher likelihood of future hospitalizations and near-fatal events.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ED ( emergency department ), HCUP ( Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project ), SEDD ( State Emergency Department Databases ), SID ( State Inpatient Databases )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

These patterns of both journal activity and the relative reliance on drug companies to fund clinical research will likely not change in the current climate of uncertain National Institutes of Health funding.\n\n【66】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【67】*   Loscalzo J\n\n【68】The NIH budget and the future of biomedical research.\n\n【69】_N Engl J Med._ 2006; 354 : 1665-1667\n\n【70】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (58)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【71】All manuscripts submitted to the _Proceedings_ , regardless of their subject matter or source of funding, are first subjected to Editorial Board oversight and, for those with sufficient quality, later engaged in formal peer review. For any original article or meta-analysis, that peer review will involve physicians and scientists with expertise on the manuscript's topic, plus an evaluation by 1 or more masters or doctorate degree biostatisticians or epidemiologists. These statisticians and epidemiologists pay close attention to study design, data collection (including the possibility of selection bias), data analysis, reporting of data, conclusions drawn from the data, and related issues. The Editorial Board and I would argue that no journal has a more structured and stringent process than ours for evaluating manuscripts at initial peer review. The value we place on data review is best validated by the considerable number of manuscripts that get supportive evaluations by physicians and scientists, only to be rejected on the basis of the statisticians' and epidemiologists' identification of unremediable flaws.\n\n【72】Using this type of comprehensive review, the journal has identified numerous instances of authors' bias and malfeasance (including duplicate publication, plagiarism, and, rarely, fraud), and these have been appropriately addressed both publicly\n\n【73】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【74】*   Lanier WL\n*   Scheife RT\n\n【75】Correction: notice of duplicate publication.\n\n【76】_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2000; 75 : 1340-1341\n\n【77】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (5)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【78】and privately. Although drug company-sponsored manuscripts have sometimes been involved in these transgressions, the fact remains that at _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , the overwhelming majority of problem authors and manuscripts (according to my recollections of more than 7 years of activity) have not involved an identifiable funding source (including drug companies) as the cause of the aberrant behavior. Instead, these moral lapses most commonly appear to be related to ego and greed and authors' desire to acquire or protect academic or clinical “turf.” Consistent with this pattern, deficiencies in comportment and lapses in ethics have clustered more around senior authors with considerable academic accomplishments and reputations, not (the frequently used stereotype of) young, undeveloped academicians under the thumb of drug companies. These patterns have persisted, year by year, as this journal has transformed itself from more of a continuing medical education type of format to a journal that now publishes more cutting-edge research and other time-sensitive materials.\n\n【79】If we select out the subset of drug company-sponsored manuscripts that have experienced the most difficulty during peer review, the overwhelming reason for their rejection is that the manuscripts simply did not meet the journal's high standards for quality required for publication.\n\n【80】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【81】*   Lanier WL\n\n【82】_Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ 2006: enhancing journal quality and access \\[editorial\\].\n\n【83】_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2006; 81 : 10-11\n\n【84】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (3)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【85】Aside from that, perhaps the next most likely reason for rejection is a bias, sometimes in the conduct of original research, but more commonly in the writing of introductions and discussions for original research manuscripts, and the selection of topics and writing of discussions for review articles. I have long inferred (as a result of my own readings and after talking with authors and drug company representatives) that a large fraction of these infringements result from the excessive influence of drug company marketing divisions,\n\n【86】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【87】*   Langreth R\n*   Herper M\n\n【88】Pill pushers: How the drug industry abandoned science for salesmanship.\n\n【89】_Forbes._ May 8, 2006; 177 : 94-102\n\n【90】*   Google Scholar\n\n【91】often without acceptance from, or with begrudging acceptance from, authors and their drug company investigator counterparts. When such problems are identified in a manuscript submitted to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ and they cannot be addressed by minor revision, the manuscript is immediately rejected.\n\n【92】Of note, this same standard applies to all manuscripts processed at _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , not just those having industry funding. Once bias is identified within an otherwise promising manuscript, the journal either demands that the authors fix the problem or the manuscript is rejected.\n\n【93】For all manuscripts reviewed by the _Proceedings_ , authors are required to reveal any financial or other relationships that may influence their research or its reporting. For those manuscripts we eventually publish, this information is provided to readers, in accordance with the guidelines outlined by the _American Medical Association Manual of Style_ .\n\n【94】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【95】*   Iverson C\n*   Flanagin A\n*   Fontanarosa PB\n*   et al.\n\n【96】American Medical Association Manual of Style: A Guide for Authors and Editors. 9th ed. Williams & Wilkins , Baltimore, Md 1998\n\n【97】*   Google Scholar\n\n【98】_Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ will continue to review and, when appropriate, publish articles funded by drug companies and other forms of industry. These manuscripts will undergo the same scrutiny as other manuscripts. If there is even a hint of bias or other problem, we will do our very best to identify the solution (including possible rejection) that best adheres to the journal's mission and standards. We caution readers to not conclude that, just because a manuscript has received industry funding, it is tainted. Conversely, readers should also not infer that absence of industry support equates with absence of conflict of interest. Instead, readers should critically examine the reports themselves and—along with interpretation emanating from introductory editorials, journal correspondence, subsequent reports, etc—determine the merits and limitations of the research.\n\n【99】At the heart of the _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ approach to manuscript review is the assumption that the pharmaceutical industry is diverse, and the culture of one company and the next may vary considerably, just as the culture of one division within a company may vary from another division within that company. Such diversity is mirrored in the makeup and motivation of medical centers and their contributing administrators, physicians, and scientists. While one may effectively argue that unbridled enthusiasm for marketing and finances are globally compromising the pharmaceutical industry and the overall practice of medicine, the fact remains that _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ must work within this environment and attempt to bring the most important, relevant, and useful information to its core audience.

Treatment-stratified, risk-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were constructed.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】During the study period, CLPC was diagnosed in 294,160 patients. Of these patients, 123,850 (42.1%) underwent surgery and 101,627 (34.5%) underwent radiotherapy, whereas 68,683 (23.3%) received no treatment. Overall 5-year and 10-year survival rates for Asians (85.6% and 67.6%, respectively), Hispanics (85.9% and 69.0%, respectively), and whites (83.9% and 65.7%, respectively) were higher than for blacks (81.5% and 61.7%, respectively) ( _P_ <.001). Prostate cancer–specific survival also varied significantly by race ( _P_ <.001). A risk-adjusted model stratified by primary treatment modality revealed that blacks had worse overall survival than whites (hazard ratio, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.33-1.41; _P_ <.001), whereas Asians had better survival compared with whites (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.76-0.83; _P_ <.001). After the effects of treatment were accounted for, Hispanics had similar overall survival compared with whites (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-1.01; _P_ \\=.10).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Blacks with CLPC have poorer survival than whites, whereas Asians have better survival, even after risk adjustment and stratification by treatment. These data may be relevant to US regions with large underserved populations that have limited access to health care.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ADT ( androgen-deprivation therapy ), CLPC ( clinically localized prostate cancer ), HR ( hazard ratio ), SEER ( Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

Hoffman (1887-1966), a rare woman of her time whose amazing life is hard to summarize in one paragraph, was born on June 15, 1887, in New York, New York, and was exposed very early in life to the art world as the daughter of the famed pianist and composer Richard Hoffman (1831-1909). Showing an affinity for sculpture, Hoffman began studying at the Art Students League in New York when she was 14 years old. After the death of her father, Hoffman moved abroad and was accepted as a student of world-renowned sculptor Auguste Rodin. In World War I, Hoffman served with the American Red Cross and assisted President Hoover in the Balkans during the war restoration period. It is no surprise that many of her sculptures memorialize battles and war heroes. Hoffman also exhibited sculpture in the 1933 Chicago World's Fair and throughout the United States and Europe, and she was commissioned to create a series of sculptures (109) to document the “Races of Mankind,” which can be seen in the Field Museum, Chicago, Illinois. Hoffman continued sculpting right up to the time of her death.\n\n【1】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【2】*   Margaret R.\n*   Wentz B.A.\n\n【3】Malvina Hoffman remembered.\n\n【4】http://www.hampton.lib.nh.us/hampton/biog/malvinahoffman.htm\n\n【5】*   Google Scholar\n\n【6】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【7】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【8】Malvina Hoffman—American Sculptor.\n\n【9】http://www.bronze-gallery.com/sculptors/artist.cfm?sculptorID=73\n\n【10】*   Google Scholar\n\n【11】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【12】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【13】Malvina Hoffman Answers website.\n\n【14】http://www.answers.com/topic/malvina-hoffman\n\n【15】*   Google Scholar\n\n【16】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【17】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【18】Mavina Hoffman.\n\n【19】http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvina\\_Hoffman\n\n【20】*   Google Scholar\n\n【21】St. Francis (the inspiration for this sculpture) was born into a wealthy family in Assisi, Italy, and after hearing the prayer of Christ, “Rebuild My Church,” as a young man, he renounced the privileges of his family position and embraced a life of radical poverty.

The story tells of a wolf that was terrorizing the people of Gubbio, Italy, and St. Francis made a pact with the wolf requesting that it stop killing the people.

He was taught to read at 4 years of age by his mother Mattie and became an avid reader and a straight-A student. Unfortunately, his mother died of complications from pre-eclampsia when he was 7 years old. Arthur and his younger brother Johnnie were raised by their father, Arthur Ashe, Sr (1920-1989), who worked as a caretaker for the Richmond recreation department.\n\n【2】A local university student and part-time tennis coach, Ronald Charity (1929-1991), spotted Ashe’s athletic talent and taught him tennis strokes and proper form. When Ashe was 10 years old, Charity introduced him to Dr Robert Walter Johnson (1899-1971), who became his mentor and lifelong coach. Dr Johnson also coached Althea Gibson (1927-2003), who in 1956 became the first African American woman to win a Grand Slam title.\n\n【3】At age 15, Arthur was the first African-American to play in the Maryland boys’ tennis championships. He spent his senior year of high school in St. Louis, Missouri, in order to play against stronger opponents than could be found in Richmond, and 2 years later he was mentioned in _Sports Illustrated_ magazine as a promising “Face in the Crowd.” Graduating as valedictorian of his high school class, he received a full scholarship to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), which had one of the most outstanding college tennis programs in the country.\n\n【4】While at UCLA, Ashe became the first Black member of the US Davis Cup tournament team in 1963 and played on its team for years. Despite participating in many tennis tournaments while a student – enough to be ranked in the top 3 US men’s tennis players in 1965 – he continued with excellent grades and graduated with a degree in Business Administration from UCLA in 1966. This was followed by 2 years in the US Army, where he worked as a data processor at West Point, headed the United States Military Academy’s tennis program, and continued to participate in major tennis tournaments.\n\n【5】Ashe won the US Open in 1968, his first major tournament victory, but could not accept the prize money of $14,000 because he was still an amateur player; therefore, the prize money went to the runner-up. To date he has been the only Black man to win the US Open. (Francis Tiafoe reached the US Open semi-finals in 2022 but was defeated by Carlos Alcaraz Garfia from Spain.)\n\n【6】After changing his status from amateur to professional, Ashe applied for a visa in 1969 to travel to South Africa to compete in the South African Open. However, his application was refused by the South African government due to apartheid rules. While he was eventually allowed into South Africa, and visited 4 times in the early 1970s, his complaints about his treatment by South African officials and White citizens contributed to the expulsion of the country from the International Lawn Tennis Federation.\n\n【7】Arthur Ashe won the Australian Open in 1970, which led to considerable international publicity. He supported the creation of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) in 1972 and became the ATP President 2 years later. In 1975, Ashe won the Wimbledon singles title when he beat Jimmy Connors in 4 sets. The following year he was ranked number 2 in the world by the ATP, his highest ATP ranking.\n\n【8】In 1977, Arthur married photographer Jeanne Moutoussamy (born 1951), whom he met at a United Negro College Fund (UNCF) event. The couple subsequently adopted a daughter in 1986, whom they named Camera because of her mother’s occupation.\n\n【9】At age 36, Ashe had a heart attack during a tennis clinic in New York and underwent quadruple bypass surgery in December 1979. Recurrence of symptoms after the surgery forced his retirement from tennis in 1980 with an outstanding lifetime record of 818 wins and 260 losses. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island in 1985.\n\n【10】Ashe required a second bypass surgery in 1983, and it is believed that during this procedure he received a blood transfusion contaminated by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). He was diagnosed with AIDS in 1988 after developing neuropathy from toxoplasmosis.\n\n【11】Following his retirement from tennis, Ashe taught a course titled “The Black Athlete in Contemporary Society” at Florida Memorial College, a historically Black university in Miami Gardens, Florida. He had learned that little had been written about the history of Black Americans in sports and proceeded to write a 3-volume book “A Hard Road to Glory,” which was published in 1988.\n\n【12】As a member of a 31-person delegation to South Africa in 1991, Ashe noted the political changes in the country since the 1970s, as the apartheid era was ending and the country was moving toward integration. At an event in New York, he met Nelson Mandela, who had been incarcerated for 27 years by the South African government and was finally released in 1990. Mandela stated during his imprisonment that Ashe was the first person he wanted to talk to after getting out of prison, after reading so much about the tennis star.\n\n【13】In April 1992, since the newspaper _USA Today_ was planning to go public about Ashe’s diagnosis of AIDS, he and his wife held a press conference and announced the diagnosis. He became active in efforts to raise more funding for AIDS research, emphasizing the disease was a major problem all over the world. That same year, Ashe was named “Sportsman of the Year” by _Sports Illustrated_ . He founded the Arthur Ashe Institute for Urban Health and also finished his memoir, “Days of Grace” only a few months before his death.\n\n【14】Arthur Ashe died February 6, 1993, from an AIDS related pneumonia, at age 49. He was the first person to lay in state at the Virginia Governor’s Mansion since Confederate General Stonewall Jackson during the Civil War. More than 5,000 mourners lined up to walk past his casket while the funeral was attended by nearly 6,000 people, including the Virginia governor and New York City mayor. His funeral service was conducted by Andrew Young, former Atlanta mayor and United Nations Ambassador, who had officiated Ashe’s wedding in 1977.\n\n【15】A statue of Arthur Ashe was dedicated on Monument Avenue in Richmond. The following year, the USTA announced that the main stadium at USTA National Tennis Center in Flushing, New York, would be named the Arthur Ashe Stadium. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton.\n\n【16】The United States Postal Service issued an Arthur Ashe commemorative postage stamp (Scott #3936) on August 27, 2005, coinciding with the beginning of the US Open that year.\n\n【17】Potential Competing Interests\n-----------------------------\n\n【18】The authors report no potential competing interests.\n\n【19】Article info\n------------\n\n【20】### Footnotes\n\n【21】Stamp Vignettes focus on biographical details and accomplishments related to science and medicine, and not individual views and prejudices except where they had a major impact on the subject's life.

Without swift actions to investigate and deal with sexual harassment, underreporting will continue to occur and sexual harassment will remain normalized in the health care environment as it has for so long become normalized in the greater society.\n\n【98】Yet, there is a challenge in demonstrating that institutional policies actually have consequences. When charges of sexual harassment are initiated, a fair and equitable investigation must be undertaken that respects the rights of both the accuser and the accused, and appropriate action must ensue. An employee, learner, or patient found to have committed sexual harassment may be dismissed, which may be highly visible to others, including the accuser. Yet, if individuals accused of sexual harassment face consequences or interventions short of dismissal that are not visible to others because of privacy issues, or if there is a perception that the consequences are not severe enough, cynicism and distrust may ensue. As well, organizations face challenges of when to act on a charge of sexual harassment if it does not happen in the work or learning environment but, instead, happens in a social context, when the impact in the work or educational setting is less clear. Each institution must work through these scenarios on a case-by-case basis and try their best to adhere to their policies and procedures.\n\n【99】So where do we go from here in our health care institutions? Transparency and sharing lessons learned to come up with a collective way to stamp out sexual harassment are critical. We must continually and steadfastly address sexual harassment and have a zero tolerance policy. We must be willing to investigate reported instances in a fair and consistent way, respecting the rights of both the accuser and the accused. Institutions must learn from mistakes when sexual harassment has gone unaddressed and strive to do better in the future. Expectations for appropriate behavior must be set for all who are part of the health care ecosystem. Tools for providers and learners must be given to help employees and learners proactively handle these situations, including how to report sexual harassment, how to handle the harasser, and how to effectively develop working relationships with coworkers, mentees, and, especially, those of different sexes. Last, this problem will not go away without the continued relentless focus from the greater society as a whole on this societal problem.

Hypertension in pregnancy includes a spectrum of conditions, most notably preeclampsia, a form of hypertension unique to pregnancy that occurs de novo or superimposed on chronic hypertension. Risks to the fetus include premature delivery, growth retardation, and death. The only definitive treatment of preeclampsia is delivery. Treatment of severe hypertension is necessary to prevent cerebrovascular, cardiac, and renal complications in the mother. The 2 other forms of hypertension, chronic and transient hypertension, usually have more benign courses. Optimal treatment of high blood pressure in pregnancy requires consideration of several aspects unique to gestational cardiovascular physiology. The major goal is to prevent maternal complications without compromising uteroplacental perfusion and fetal circulation. Before an antihypertensive agent is prescribed, the potential risk to the fetus from intrauterine drug exposure should be carefully reviewed.\n\n【1】ACE ( angiotensin-converting enzyme ), DBP ( diastolic blood pressure ), HELLP ( hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelet count ), NHBPEP ( National High Blood Pressure Education Program ), SBP ( systolic blood pressure )\n\n【2】Normal pregnancy is characterized by increases in cardiac output and blood volume, generalized vasodilatation, a decrease in blood pressure, and resistance to pressor agents such as norepinephrine and angiotensin II.\n\n【3】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【4】*   McLaughlin MK\n*   Roberts JM\n\n【5】Hemodynamic changes.\n\n【6】in: Lindheimer MD Roberts JM Cunningham FG Chesley's Hypertensive Disorders in Pregnancy. 2nd ed.

For hospitalized patients, the lateral recumbent position eliminates the effect of compression of the inferior vena cava by the enlarged uterus that impairs venous return and causes a decline in blood pressure. Regardless of posture, special care should be taken to ensure that the patient's arms are kept at the heart level; positioning the arms above the heart can spuriously reduce the blood pressure readings. In pregnancy, the lowest blood pressures are obtained by using the right arm while the patient is resting in the left lateral position.\n\n【17】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【18】*   Van Dongen PW\n*   Eskes TK\n*   Martin CB\n*   Van't Hof MA\n\n【19】Postural blood pressure differences in pregnancy: a prospective study of blood pressure differences between supine and left lateral position as measured by ultrasound.\n\n【20】_Am j Obstet Gynecol._ 1980; 138 : 1-5\n\n【21】*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (17)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【22】These blood pressure readings might merely reflect the changes in hydrostatic pressure caused by keeping the right arm above the heart.

Because of disagreement between random and 24-hour urinary protein determinations, the latter is recommended for diagnostic purposes. If this is not feasible, a timed urinary collection corrected for creatinine excretion is an acceptable alternative. The diagnosis of hypertension is supported by recording elevated blood pressure on 2 determinations performed 6 hours apart.\n\n【45】An important feature of preeclampsia is its unpredictable clinical course; women with mild hypertension and minimal proteinuria can have rapid progression to the convulsive form of eclampsia. Thus, distinguishing between “mild” and “severe” forms is discouraged because it can be clinically misleading.\n\n【46】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【47】*   August P\n\n【48】Preeclampsia: new thoughts on an ancient problem.\n\n【49】_J Clin Hypertens._ 2000; 2 : 115-123\n\n【50】*   Google Scholar\n\n【51】However, certain symptoms and signs are considered markers of severe disease and necessitate close monitoring and, frequently, urgent delivery. These include an SBP of 160 mm Hg or higher and a DBP of 110 mm Hg or higher, nephrotic range proteinuria (protein level ≥3.5 g/24 h), renal functional impairment (serum creatinine level >1.2 mg/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100 × l0\n\n【52】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【53】*   Sibai BM\n*   Anderson GD\n\n【54】Pregnancy outcome of intensive therapy in severe hypertension in first trimester.\n\n【55】_Obstet Gynecol._ 1986; 67 : 517-522\n\n【56】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【57】/L), and/or evidence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, hepatocellular injury, pulmonary edema, and neurologic disturbances.\n\n【58】Preeclampsia usually occurs after 20 weeks of gestation and traditionally is considered a disease of the first pregnancy. However, women with a history of preeclampsia have an increased risk during subsequent pregnancies. Other risk factors include extremes of reproductive age, multiple gestations (eg, twins), family history of preeclampsia, and the presence of trophoblastic disease, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, connective tissue disease, and renal disease. The hemodynamic changes include decreased cardiac output relative to normal pregnancy, elevated peripheral vascular resistance,\n\n【59】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【60】*   Visser W\n*   Wallenburg HC\n\n【61】Central hemodynamic observations in untreated precclamptic patients.\n\n【62】_Hypertension._ 1991; 17 : 1072-1077\n\n【63】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【64】and loss or reversal of the normal diurnal rhythm, resulting in elevated nocturnal blood pressure readings.\n\n【65】The _h_ emolysis, _e_ levated _l_ iver enzymes, _l_ ow _p_ latelet count (HELLP) syndrome is a deceptive form of preeclampsia. It can rapidly evolve into a life-threatening syndrome of liver failure and worsening thrombocytopenia in the presence of only mild to moderate hypertension. The most severe complication of the HELLP syndrome is liver rupture, which has high maternal and fetal mortality rates.\n\n【66】The cause and pathogenesis of preeclampsia remain elusive. Consequently, specific preventive and treatment options have not been developed. Ideally, high-risk patients should be evaluated early in pregnancy by an obstetrician with special expertise in this field. The baseline values for hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, serum uric acid, creatinine, and protein excretion should be obtained because a comparison with values later in pregnancy may help in establishing the diagnosis of preeclampsia.\n\n【67】Patients presenting with hypertension in the second half of pregnancy should be additionally monitored for hepatic involvement (serum transaminase levels), presence of hemolysis (lactic acid dehydrogenase level and blood smear), and degree of capillary leak (serum albumin level). These tests are particularly useful in monitoring disease severity and progression.\n\n【68】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【69】*   National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group Report on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy\n\n【70】Report of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy.\n\n【71】_Am J Obstet Gynecol._ 2000; 183 : Sl-S22\n\n【72】*   Google Scholar\n\n【73】If preeclampsia develops at less than 32 weeks' gestation, when the fetus is still immature, consideration should be given to postponing delivery.\n\n【74】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【75】*   Sibai BM\n*   Mercer BM\n*   Schiff E\n*   Friedman SA\n\n【76】Aggressive versus expectant management of severe preeclampsia at 28 to 32 weeks' gestation: a randomized controlled trial.\n\n【77】_Am J Obstet Gynecol._ 1994; 171 : 818-822\n\n【78】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【79】This is a reasonable approach when hypertension is mild, and no renal, liver, or coagulation abnormalities are evident.

Intravenous magnesium sulfate therapy has been shown to be more effective than either phenytoin or diazepam for seizure prophylaxis in women with severe preeclampsia and for prevention of recurrent seizures in those with eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate should be administered during labor and delivery and for at least 24 hours postpartum by con­tinuous intravenous infusion. To avoid magnesium toxicity in women with renal insufficiency, the maintenance dose should be reduced, and the serum magnesium levels should be monitored every 1 to 2 hours (compared to every 4-6 hours in women with normal renal function) until a steady state is reached. Effective therapy for magnesium toxicity is intravenous calcium gluconate, which should be available at the bedside.\n\n【93】Studies have shown that pharmacological treatment of DBP of 110 mm Hg or greater decreases the incidence of acute maternal cardiac and cerebral insults.\n\n【94】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【95】*   Sibai BM\n*   Anderson GD\n\n【96】Pregnancy outcome of intensive therapy in severe hypertension in first trimester.\n\n【97】_Obstet Gynecol._ 1986; 67 : 517-522\n\n【98】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【99】Most investigators agree that antihypertensive therapy in the peripartum period should be initiated when the DBP approaches 100 mm Hg.\n\n【100】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【101】*   August P\n\n【102】Preeclampsia: new thoughts on an ancient problem.\n\n【103】_J Clin Hypertens._ 2000; 2 : 115-123\n\n【104】*   Google Scholar\n\n【105】The most important reason for treatment of hypertension is the prevention of maternal cerebrovasular and cardiac complications. Control of blood pressure does not prevent or cure preeclampsia. In fact, eclamptic seizures can occur when the blood pressure is only mildly elevated.\n\n【106】### Chronic Hypertension\n\n【107】The hallmark of chronic hypertension is a blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or greater before pregnancy or before the 20th week of gestation. Most patients will have a benign course with an exaggerated decrease in DBP of as much as 20 mm Hg. This often leads to normalization of blood pressure in midpregnancy\n\n【108】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【109】*   Sibai BM\n*   Abdella TN\n*   Anderson GD\n\n【110】Pregnancy outcome in 211 patients with mild chronic hypertension.\n\n【111】_Obstet Gynecol._ 1983; 61 : 571-576\n\n【112】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【113】and may mask the diagnosis of chronic hypertension if prepregnancy values are unknown. The blood pressure usually increases to pregnancy levels in the third trimester, frequently leading to diagnostic confusion with preeclampsia. Proteinuria is absent in uncomplicated chronic hypertension, and when it occurs for the first time in the third trimester, it is the best indicator of superimposed preeclampsia. Antihypertensive treatment is usually instituted for an SBP of 150 mm Hg or greater or a DBP of 100 mm Hg or greater, unless there is evidence of renal disease or other target organ complica­tions.\n\n【114】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【115】*   Cunningham FG\n*   Lindheimer MD\n\n【116】Hypertension in pregnancy.\n\n【117】_N Engl J Med._ 1992; 326 : 927-932\n\n【118】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (296)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【119】In these instances, antihypertensive therapy is initiated when the DBP is 90 mm Hg or greater. Women with chronic hypertension are at an increased risk for developing preeclampsia, particularly if the blood pressure does not decline in midgestation or if they have secondary hypertension. Ideally, they should be evaluated before pregnancy for end-organ damage, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, hypertensive nephropathy, and retinopathy. A work-up of secondary hypertension should be considered (eg, primary hyperaldosteronism, renovascular disease, pheochromocytoma), particularly in young patients with hard-to-control blood pressure requiring several antihypertensive agents. Medications prescribed before pregnancy can be continued during pregnancy except for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin **II** receptor blockers. Women taking these medications who present for prepregnancy counseling should be told to use another agent (eg, methyldopa) before conception.\n\n【120】The combination of hypertension and kidney disease is associated with increased risks of fetal loss, prematurity, and intrauterine growth retardation. Women with chronic renal diseases should be advised to plan their pregnancies while their renal function is relatively preserved (serum creatinine level ≤1.4 mg/dL)\n\n【121】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【122】*   National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group Report on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy\n\n【123】Report of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy.\n\n【124】_Am J Obstet Gynecol._ 2000; 183 : Sl-S22\n\n【125】*   Google Scholar\n\n【126】because fetal prognosis has improved with the neonatal care currently available. Such patients require the collaborative efforts of a multidisciplinary team, including high-risk obstetrics, nephrology, and hypertension, for optimal treatment.\n\n【127】Women with preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension are at particularly high risk for cerebral hemorrhage and placental abruption.

This category encompasses both women with preeclampsia who have not yet developed proteinuria and those with hypertension only. The differentiation between these 2 groups is possible only retrospectively, ie, postpartum. _Transient hypertension_ (the term previously used for this category) refers to a subgroup of women in whom blood pressure returns to normal by 12 weeks' postpartum. The failure of blood pressure to normalize leads to the diagnosis of chronic hypertension. Transient hypertension has a benign course and good prognosis, with a tendency to recur in subsequent pregnancies.

In addition to proven safety, an ideal antihypertensive agent should gradually reduce blood pressure without compromising uteroplacental blood flow to the fetus.

Early diagnosis and subsequent close monitoring of both mother and fetus are crucial. Elevated blood pressure without proteinuria usually has a benign course and can be managed on an outpatient basis. Antihypertensive medications should be used judiciously, and fetal risks from intrauterine exposure must be carefully evaluated. Severe preeclampsia (both pure and superimposed) represents an obstetrical emergency, with potential fatal outcomes for both fetus and mother. Optimally, such women should be hospitalized and treated with bed rest, antihypertensive medications, and magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis. The definitive treatment of preeclampsia is delivery. For mild forms remote from term, postponing delivery is desirable and, if possible, can improve neonatal prognosis by decreasing prematurity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Anthropometry included weight; hip circumference; waist circumference; waist-hip, waist-height, and weight-height ratios; body adiposity index; and body mass index. Body fat and percentage of fat were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and abdominal visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured by computed tomography. Bivariate correlations, logistic regression models, and receiver operator characteristic curves were used, and analyses were stratified by sex and race.\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】In each sex-by-race group, all anthropometric measures were highly correlated with percentage of fat, fat mass, and subcutaneous adipose tissue and moderately correlated with visceral adipose tissue, with the exception of the waist-hip ratio. The odds of having an elevated cardiometabolic risk were increased more than 2-fold per SD increase for most anthropometric variables, and the areas under the curve for each anthropometric measure were significantly greater than 0.5.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】Several common anthropometric measures were moderately to highly correlated with total body fat, abdominal fat, and cardiovascular disease risk factors in a biracial sample of women and men.

He had kyphoscoliosis, for which he had undergone thoracic spinal fusion and instrumentation 32 years previously. Chest radiography revealed an extrathoracic “soft tissue mass” (9.5 × 8.5 cm). Computed tomography identified an extrapleural lesion (9 × 8 × 7 cm) suspicious for a spinal neurofibroma with cord invasion, as well as bony erosion of thoracic vertebrae and neural foramina. Concern of malignancy prompted surgical consultations. A computed tomographic myelogram revealed a meningocele at T7-T8 (measuring 7.5 cm maximally), communicating with cerebrospinal fluid and multiple smaller meningoceles at adjacent levels.\n\n【1】Neurofibromatosis type 1 is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with a tumor suppressor gene defect on chromosome 17q. Its incidence is 1 in 3500 persons. Although NF1 has variable expression, it is usually recognized by cutaneous stigmas such as café-au-lait macules and intertriginous freckling and by development of neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas are a distinct type of neurogenic tumor with malignant potential. About 10% of patients with NF1 develop malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors with very poor prognosis. Bone dysplasia, scoliosis, and meningeal defects (spanning from dural ectasia to meningoceles) are common in patients with NF1. Intrathoracic meningoceles are rare but, when present, are usually seen in the constellation of NF1. The etiology of meningoceles is thought to be herniation of spinal meninges with cerebrospinal fluid extrusion through enlarged intervertebral foramina. Treatment ranges from observation to excision. Given the absence of symptoms in our patient, expectant management was recommended.\n\n【2】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【3】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【4】_We thank Dr Dusica Babovic-Vuksanovic for her thoughtful review and editorial comments._\n\n【5】Article info\n------------\n\n【6】### Identification\n\n【7】DOI: https://doi.org/10.4065/84.9.769\n\n【8】### Copyright\n\n【9】© 2009 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

The Revised International Prognostic Scoring System and other risk models were applied for risk stratification. Separate analyses were conducted for patients diagnosed before 2005 (n=531) and after 2005 (n=469).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】Eighty-five percent of patients were older than 60 years (median age, 72 years), with 69% being men. The median follow-up period was 27 months (range, 0-300 months), during which time 808 (81%) deaths and 129 (13%) leukemic transformations were documented. Median survival and leukemic transformation rates were similar in patients diagnosed before or after 2005, despite the significantly higher use of hypomethylating agents in the latter group: 33 months vs 28 months ( _P_ \\=.46) and 13% vs 10% ( _P_ \\=.92), respectively. Revised International Prognostic Scoring System risk distribution was similar in patients diagnosed before or after 2005 ( _P_ \\=.23): 17% were categorized as very low, 36% low, 21% intermediate, 15% high, and 11% very high risk, with a median survival of 72, 43, 24, 18, and 7 months, respectively ( _P_ <.001). We found Revised International Prognostic Scoring System cytogenetic risk categorization to be suboptimal in its performance, whereas contemporary prognostic models were broadly similar in their performance.\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】The poor outcome in patients with MDS does not appear to have improved over time. Current risk stratification systems for MDS are not substantially different from each other. There is a dire need for drugs that are truly disease modifying and risk models that incorporate prognostically relevant mutations.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】HR ( hazard ratio ), IPSS ( International Prognostic Scoring System ), IPSS-R ( Revised International Prognostic Scoring System ), FAB ( French American British ), LT ( leukemic transformation ), MDAS ( MD Anderson score ), MDS ( myelodysplastic syndrome ), MK ( monosomal karyotype ), RAEB-1 ( refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 ), RCMD ( refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia ), WHO ( World Health Organization ), WPSS ( World Health Organization Prognostic Scoring System )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

Currently accepted criteria for consideration of bariatric surgery include a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) of 40 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> or greater (or >35 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> with obesity-related comorbidities), documented or high probability of failure of nonsurgical weight loss treatments, and assurance that the patient is well informed, motivated, and compliant. Appropriate patient selection is important in achieving optimal outcomes after bariatric surgery. In this article, we review our approach to the medical and psychological assessment of patients who want to undergo bariatric surgery. The medical evaluation is designed to identify and optimally treat medical comorbidities that may affect perioperative risks and long-term outcomes. The psychiatric and psychological assessment identifies factors that may influence long-term success in maintaining weight loss and prepares the patient for the lifestyle changes needed both before and after surgery.\n\n【1】BMI ( body mass index ), CAD ( coronary artery disease ), OSA ( obstructive sleep apnea ), RYGB ( Roux-en-Y gastric bypass )\n\n【2】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【3】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【4】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【5】One-time access price info\n\n【6】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【7】### Subscribe:\n\n【8】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【9】Already a print subscriber?

WMD-related knowledge and skills must be incorporated into the training of physicians at all levels, from medical school and graduate education to CME and board recertification. We need to ask ourselves, “Are we doing enough?”\n\n【25】We believe that WMD-related instruction should follow the model of basic life support or advanced cardiac life support programs, with introduction in the undergraduate curriculum and reinforcement through a career-long recertification program. This recommendation is based on the understanding that dealing with WMD injuries requires unique knowledge and skills that, once acquired, may deteriorate with time if not periodically reviewed and practiced. The need for expertise in the medical treatment of WMD injuries is no longer unique to military physicians, and the experience at the Uniformed Services University School of Medicine may provide a model for others. At the Uniformed Services University, basic science courses incorporate topics such as the pathology of biowarfare agents, the physiology of radiation injuries, and pharmacological treatments for WMD attacks. Furthermore, every student participates in hands-on training to inculcate skills such as triage, decontamination, self-protection in a WMD environment, and medical planning for emergencies. Two week-long field exercises, one in the summer before the second year of medical school and the other during the fourth year, mimic a real-world experience for students in all aspects of WMD medical treatment.\n\n【26】Instruction regarding WMD injuries should not remain confined to undergraduate medical education.

One particularly challenging clinical question is related to the evaluation of suspected cognitive decline or dementia in older adults with I/DD, a question that most physicians feel ill-prepared to answer. The National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices was convened to help formally address this topic, which remains largely underrepresented in the medical literature. The task group, comprising specialists who work extensively with adults with I/DD, has promulgated the following Consensus Recommendations for the Evaluation and Management of Dementia in Adults With Intellectual Disabilities as a framework for the practicing physician who seeks to approach this clinical question practically, thoughtfully, and comprehensively.\n\n【2】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【3】I/DD ( intellectual and developmental disabilities ), NTG ( National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices )\n\n【4】The National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Practices (NTG) was formed as a response to the National Alzheimer's Project Act, legislation signed into law by President Barack Obama. One objective of the NTG is to highlight the additional needs of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (I/DD) who are affected or will be affected by Alzheimer's disease and related disorders. The American Academy of Developmental Medicine and Dentistry, the Rehabilitation Research and Training Center on Aging With Developmental Disabilities–Lifespan Health and Function at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities combined their efforts to form the NTG to ensure that the concerns and needs of people with intellectual disabilities and their families, when affected by dementia, are and continue to be considered as part of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease\n\n【5】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【6】US Department of Health and Human Services.

The guidelines and recommendations outlined in this document represent the consensus reached among said specialists at 2 plenary meetings and ongoing discussions that followed, informed by a review of the current literature and drawn from each specialist's clinical practice; thus, they meet level 2 (case-controlled studies) and level 3 (observational studies) for evidence in clinical application. These guidelines are a suggested starting point as we develop more formal methods to determine best practices of evaluation of dementia in this population.\n\n【14】Background\n----------\n\n【15】Adults with I/DD are now regularly living into old age, with many surviving into their 70s, 80s, and beyond. Dementia is among the most clinically challenging co-occurring conditions of aging in a select group in this population (ie, adults with Down syndrome and those with brain injury) considering that the approach to evaluation, diagnosis, treatment, and management of dementia in adults with I/DD remains largely undefined in the literature.\n\n【16】It is well established that adults with I/DD experience poorer health outcomes compared with the general population, a trend seen in mortality, morbidity, and quality of life.\n\n【17】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【18】*   Krahn G.L.\n*   Hammond L.\n*   Turner A.\n\n【19】A cascade of disparities: health and health care access for people with intellectual disabilities.\n\n【20】_Ment Retard Dev Disabil Res Rev._ 2006; 12 : 70-82\n\n【21】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (529)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【22】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【23】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【24】*   Perkins E.A.\n*   Moran J.A.\n\n【25】Aging adults with intellectual disabilities.\n\n【26】_JAMA._ 2010; 304 : 91-92\n\n【27】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (74)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【28】The cause of this disparity is complex and multifactorial, but poor training and preparedness of health care professionals nationwide ranks among the key contributing factors.

The goal of this article is to clarify key principles of evaluation and management of dementia in adults with I/DD (≥20 years old) on the basis of evidence-based research and consensus among experts in the NTG.\n\n【35】Prevalence of Dementia in Patients With Intellectual Disability\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】In Down syndrome, one of the most common forms of intellectual disability, the underlying genetic link between trisomy 21 and Alzheimer's disease has been convincingly established.\n\n【37】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【38】Janicki M.P.

Although this is usually relatively straightforward to establish in the general population, it can be a much more complicated task in adults with intellectual disabilities because of variance in cognitive functioning. This is particularly true for the current generation of older adults with I/DD owing to a variety of factors, including poor record keeping from childhood, lack of ongoing involvement of family and involvement of multiple staff members (often due to a high degree of turnover), and inconsistencies in the physician-patient relationship that obviate knowing the person throughout his or her life span.\n\n【80】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【81】*   Test D.W.\n*   Flowers C.\n*   Hewitt A.\n*   Solow J.\n\n【82】Statewide study of the direct support staff workforce.\n\n【83】_Ment Retard._ 2003; 41 : 276-285\n\n【84】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【85】In the absence of a personal historian who can accurately and comprehensively attest to an individual's baseline level of functioning, the assessment of a reported or observed change may be exponentially more complicated. The early signs of dementia in adults with I/DD can be subtle and often require an astute observer to identify these changes proactively. Often individuals with I/DD are served by numerous caregivers throughout their lifetime, and often newly involved caregivers will presume that their current level of ability represents their baseline level of functioning and, thus, miss signs of early decline.\n\n【86】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【87】*   Aylward E.H.\n*   Burt D.B.\n*   Thorpe L.U.\n*   Lai F.\n*   Dalton A.\n\n【88】Diagnosis of dementia in individuals with intellectual disability.\n\n【89】_J Intellect Disabil Res._ 1997; 41 : 152-164\n\n【90】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (224)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【91】Down Syndrome and Other Forms of Intellectual Disability\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【92】Down syndrome is the only genetically inherited form of intellectual disability that has been indisputably linked to the risk of early development of Alzheimer's disease. The leading explanation for this link is tied to the triplication of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21) and the overexpression of the gene coded on this chromosome for amyloid precursor protein. The excessive production of β-amyloid as a result is key to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. In addition, other genes coded on chromosome 21 are also theorized to potentially contribute to the early emergence of dementia and the phenomenon of accelerated aging seen in adults with Down syndrome.\n\n【93】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【94】*   Prasher V.\n\n【95】Genetics, Alzheimer's disease, and Down syndrome.\n\n【96】in: Down Syndrome and Alzheimer's Disease: Biologic Correlates.

It is important that a thorough and comprehensive history be obtained to compile evidence consistent with an emerging dementia while probing for other features or patterns that might suggest other contributing factors. Pertinent historical information is particularly useful from personal accounts of caregivers and family members who have known the individual for several years. In addition, other sources of information, such as previous neuropsychological testing or school Individualized Education Program information, can greatly assist in accurately characterizing an individual's baseline. One model for obtaining such a history is detailed in a separate NTG publication regarding community supports.\n\n【124】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【125】*   Jokinen N.\n*   Janicki M.P.\n*   Keller S.M.\n*   et al.\n\n【126】National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Care Practices  \nGuidelines for structuring community care and supports for people with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.\n\n【127】_J Policy Pract Intellect Disabil._ 2013; 10 : 1-24\n\n【128】*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (46)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【129】To perform the evaluation process, we recommend the following 9-step approach.\n\n【130】#### Step 1: Gather a Pertinent Medical and Psychiatric History\n\n【131】A thorough history should include, of course, a review of the medical and psychiatric history, with particular attention to issues of the patient's personal health that could potentially influence the likelihood of development of a premature dementia. These issues include a history of cardiovascular disease; a history of cerebrovascular disease or stroke; known underlying neurologic structural abnormalities; a history of head injury, concussion, or loss of consciousness; and poorly treated sleep disorders or thyroid disease, vitamin B <sub>12 </sub> deficiency, or metabolic syndrome (obesity, diabetes, hypertension).\n\n【132】#### Step 2: Obtain a Historical Description of Baseline Functioning\n\n【133】As discussed earlier, a dementia diagnosis requires evidence of change from a previous level of functioning, and this baseline is quite individualized in people with I/DD. This description is highly dependent on the historian, and, thus, a family member or caregiver who knows the individual well should be present for this interview. Supplemental Table 1 (available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ) outlines the key factors to review when constructing a historical baseline for an individual undergoing assessment for dementia.\n\n【134】#### Step 3: Obtain a Description of Current Functioning and Compare With Baseline\n\n【135】Information gathering regarding current functioning is obtained in a similar manner as was done for the historical baseline, allowing a side-by-side comparison of the scope and degree of change over time. This practice helps systematically assess for the key criteria of dementia, specifically, “dementia is diagnosed when there are cognitive or behavioral symptoms that 1) interfere with the ability to function at work or at usual activities; and 2) represent a decline from previous levels of functioning and performing.”\n\n【136】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【137】*   McKhann G.M.\n*   Knopman D.S.\n*   Chertkow H.\n*   et al.\n\n【138】The diagnosis of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease: recommendations from the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association Workgroup.\n\n【139】_Alzheimers Dement._ 2011; 7 : 263-269\n\n【140】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (9809)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【141】Key features to look for include reported memory loss or impairment, marked changes in personality, disorientation, and decreasing performance in expected tasks/skills.\n\n【142】#### Step 4: Perform a Focused Review of Systems\n\n【143】A focused review should take an inventory of common issues that are seen with increasing age and also with possible emerging dementias. Supplemental Table 2 (available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ) summarizes the system areas that should be highlighted in an assessment of an adult with I/DD.\n\n【144】#### Step 5: Review the Medication List Thoroughly\n\n【145】Medications require specific focus, as the risk associated with polypharmacy and the involvement of multiple prescribing physicians increases with advancing age. Special attention should be given to all newly added medications, particularly those that are psychoactive, antiepileptic, or anticholinergic, and those with sedating properties. Common adverse effects and drug-drug interactions should be reviewed, with attention given to nonspecific signs and symptoms that might suggest a drug adverse effect, such as somnolence, gait instability, or urinary retention. Table 1 lists commonly used medications with potential deleterious effects on cognition in this population.\n\n【146】Table 1 Common Medication Classes Associated With Possible Worsening of Cognitive Function in Patients With Dementia\n\n| Medication class | Examples | Comments |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Antihistamines, especially first generation | DiphenhydramineHydroxyzinePromethazine | Anticholinergic adverse effects, urine retention, confusion, sedation |\n| Bladder agents | OxybutyninTolterodine | Anticholinergic adverse effects, urine retention, confusion, sedation |\n| Certain pain medications | MeperidinePropoxyphene | Meperidine: increased risk of seizures with renal impairment |\n| Tricyclic antidepressants | AmitriptylineClomipramineDoxepin | Risks and benefits of this medication class should be guided by a psychiatrist with familiarity with patients with I/DD |\n| Certain antipsychotics | ChlorpromazineClozapinePimozide | Sedation, mental sluggishness. Atypical antipsychotics have been associated with increased mortality when used to treat behavioral problems in elderly patients with dementia, but no such studies have been conducted in Down syndrome or I/DD in general |\n| Long-acting benzodiazepines | ClonazepamTemazepamDiazepam | Very sedating; caution for gait impairment, dizzinessIf a benzodiazepine is required for anxiety, consider short-acting agents (appropriately dosed): alprazolam, lorazepam |\n\n【148】I/DD = intellectual and developmental disabilities.\n\n【149】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【150】#### Step 6: Obtain a Pertinent Family History\n\n【151】A family history is important primarily for detecting a history of dementia in first-degree relatives, particularly if the disease presented prematurely (generally <50 years old, except in adults with Down syndrome), suggesting a stronger possible familial predisposition. Additional factors of note include a history of cerebrovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus in first-degree relatives.\n\n【152】#### Step 7: Assess for Other Psychosocial Issues or Changes\n\n【153】Aging adults with I/DD often confront a variety of potentially destabilizing life events merely by virtue of growing older. These events may include leaving the family home; witnessing the declining health or death of a parent, loved one, or friends/housemates; decline in one's own health, functionality, or employment status; or frequent turnover/departure of caregivers. The cumulative impact of these events in an adult with I/DD who may have limited coping skills or emotional maturity cannot be overstated. A careful assessment for these factors could identify certain triggering events and frequently also help in the identification of other coexisting mood disorders, such as untreated anxiety or depressed mood, which could be strongly influencing an individual's cognitive and functional performance.\n\n【154】Psychiatric illness may present atypically in adults with I/DD, and there is a common pitfall of diagnostic overshadowing, in which features truly related to an underlying mental illness are instead attributed to the individual's intellectual disability. The method of history taking described previously herein helps account for changes in baseline mood, behavior, or personality, which should raise red flags for a possible emerging psychiatric/mental health disorder. Pay close attention to the review of systems to highlight other potential neurovegetative signs of appetite changes, weight loss, and change in sleep patterns.\n\n【155】In patients with Down syndrome and dementia, depression and other prefrontal lobe symptoms may be more common, including signs and symptoms of indifference, uncooperativeness, apathy, and socially deficient communication or impaired adaptive functioning in general.\n\n【156】<sup><a>22</a></sup>\n\n【157】*   Ball S.L.\n*   Holland A.J.\n*   Hon J.\n*   Huppert F.A.\n*   Treppner P.\n*   Watson P.C.\n\n【158】Personality and behaviour changes mark the early stages of Alzheimer's disease in adults with Down's syndrome: findings from a prospective population-based study.\n\n【159】_Int J Geriatr Psychiatry._ 2006; 21 : 661-673\n\n【160】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (129)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【161】For a review of features of mental disorders that may present atypically in adults with I/DD, the _Diagnostic Manual–Intellectual Disability_ is a particularly helpful desk reference.\n\n【162】<sup><a>23</a></sup>\n\n【163】Fletcher R.

NADD Press , Kingston, NY 2007\n\n【164】*   Google Scholar\n\n【165】#### Step 8: Review Social History, Living Environment, and Level of Support\n\n【166】Assessment of current living conditions and level of support is increasingly critical when an emerging dementia is suspected, as evaluation of safety concerns and appropriateness of one's current placement is a priority. Even if current supports seem adequate, it is important to think proactively in the setting of a suspected dementia, knowing that there will be ever-changing and increasing needs.\n\n【167】#### Step 9: Synthesize the Information\n\n【168】Because the history and all the supporting data are obtained in a stepwise manner, the interviewer is advised to continually mentally cross-reference the information with the criteria for a dementia diagnosis, building evidence for or against the diagnosis. By the end of the history taking, a fairly strong level of suspicion should already be built.\n\n【169】### Physical Examination\n\n【170】The physical examination should be comprehensive, with specific attention to physical findings that may suggest underlying medical issues that may be contributory. Supplemental Table 3 (available online at http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org ) summarizes the key components of focus during an office examination for suspected dementia.\n\n【171】### Cognitive Assessment\n\n【172】Currently, there is no generally accepted criterion standard for memory screening or assessment in adults with I/DD. Assessment tools used in the general population (eg, the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment; see also the study by Cordell et al\n\n【173】<sup><a>24</a></sup>\n\n【174】*   Cordell C.B.\n*   Borson S.\n*   Boustani M.\n*   et al.\n\n【175】Medicare Detection of Cognitive Impairment Workgroup  \nAlzheimer's Association recommendations for operationalizing the detection of cognitive impairment during the Medicare Annual Wellness Visit in a primary care setting.\n\n【176】_Alzheimers Dement._ 2013; 9 : 1-10\n\n【177】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (691)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【178】for a recent compendium of assessment tools appropriate for the Annual Wellness Visit under the Affordable Care Act) have not been normed for adults with intellectual disabilities, and, thus, results cannot be interpreted meaningfully in adults with I/DD. The NTG has made the following recommendations for a general framework of cognitive assessment.\n\n【179】Inclusion of at least 1 standardized tool for cognitive assessment is recommended because it generates a score that can be tracked over time and provides an additional rigid data point that can be repeated on subsequent encounters. Many instruments have been developed and validated for the diagnosis of dementia in this population, including the Dementia Scale for Down's Syndrome,\n\n【180】<sup><a>25</a></sup>\n\n【181】*   Gedye A.\n\n【182】Dementia Scale for Down's Syndrome Manual.\n\n【183】Gedye Research and Consulting , Vancouver, BC, Canada 1995\n\n【184】*   Google Scholar\n\n【185】the Dementia Questionnaire for People With Learning Disabilities,\n\n【186】<sup><a>26</a></sup>\n\n【187】*   Evenhuis H.M.\n\n【188】Evaluation of a screening instrument for dementia in ageing mentally retarded persons.\n\n【189】_J Intellect Disabil Res._ 1992; 36 : 337-347\n\n【190】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【191】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【192】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【193】Evenhuis HM, Kengen MMF, Eurlings HAL.

This could be performed in the office or at the bedside if questions are flexible enough to be appropriate for the individual's baseline intellectual ability. To further enhance the information provided by the test batteries suggested previously herein, physicians are encouraged to include additional questioning to assess the individual's general orientation, reading/writing/math skills (if applicable), naming abilities (body parts, common objects), basic motor skills, general knowledge (counting, days of the week), language comprehension, and recall of newly learned information. All these components can be fairly easily added to a physician's questioning repertoire and can help point to changes if abilities decay over subsequent visits.\n\n【215】### Diagnosis\n\n【216】There exists great heterogeneity in adults with I/DD, and, thus, there is no basis for comparison against any other set of peer-based percentiles, standards, or generalized sets of expectations when assessing an individual for dementia. Assessment of decline should always be individualized and patient specific, with judgments made on the basis of deterioration from the patient's own individual baseline level of intellectual disability, function, and achievement (ie, their personal best).\n\n【217】A dementia diagnosis should never be arrived on prematurely, without a proper investigation into other contributing factors that are potentially correctable. There are several co-occurring issues that frequently masquerade as dementia or negatively compound the effects of early dementia. Table 2 summarizes these common conditions, which should be assessed during a general evaluation in an effort to identify contributors and, more importantly, to look for elements that can be treated or improved.\n\n【218】Table 2 Common Contributors to Memory Changes in Adults With I/DD\n\n| Condition | Presentation |\n| --- | --- |\n| Sensory deficits | Hearing lossVision loss, low vision, depth perception changes |\n| Metabolic disturbances | Electrolyte abnormalitiesHypoglycemia/hyperglycemiaB 12 or folate deficienciesUndetected thyroid dysfunctionAnemiaToxic levels of antiepileptic or psychoactive medicationsToxic adverse effects of certain medications (eg, hyperammonemia in chronic valproic acid use) |\n| Coexisting mood disorder | Either newly detected or subacute worsening of baseline mood disorderNote: Depression can cause symptoms that seem similar to dementia and can co-occur with early dementia |\n| Pharmacologic concerns | Polypharmacy, drug-drug interactions, and altered pharmacokinetic properties |\n| Sleep problems | Sleep apnea and other undetected sleep disorders |\n| Seizures | Undetected or worsening seizure disorders |\n| Pain | Undiagnosed pain or undertreated pain |\n| Mobility problems | Mobility disorders and loss of functionality |\n| Psychosocial or environmental stressors | Changes in routines, death or impairment of family members or close acquaintances, new regimen at home or in the workplace, reactions to threatening situations |\n| Others | Conditions that may be associated with cognitive deficit (chronic subdural hematoma, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, human immunodeficiency virus, and cryptococcal infection) |\n| Additional considerations: prevalent conditions in adults with Down syndrome | Vision impairment due to early development of cataracts and increased risk of keratoconusHearing loss due to conductive hearing deficitsThyroid dysfunction, particularly hypothyroidismObstructive sleep apneaCeliac diseaseAtlantoaxial instability and other cervical spine disorders, including osteoarthritis and spinal stenosisOsteoarthritis and associated pain and mobility limitations |\n\n【220】I/DD = intellectual and developmental disabilities.\n\n【221】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【222】The workup after an office cognitive assessment should be customized to the specific signs and concerns of each individual patient. Further assessment of 1 or more of the previously noted components may comprise the “homework” that a patient's caregiver or referral agency may be instructed to complete after the first assessment. Laboratory testing is justifiable in nearly every patient seeking cognitive assessment because blood work has a potentially high yield for uncovering or ruling out multiple common conditions that might influence cognition. A complete metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, B <sub>12 </sub> measurement, folate measurement, liver function tests, and a complete blood cell count should routinely be performed. Use of neuroimaging is recommended on a case-by-case basis, and features that should prompt consideration of brain imaging include focal findings on neurologic examination, underlying known structural abnormalities without recent imaging, suspicion of or risk factors for cerebrovascular disease, rapid and sudden neurologic/cognitive deterioration, a history of recent fall with head injury, or a history of repeated head trauma. Particularly in patients in whom the history is fragmented, treatable causes of functional decline, such demyelinating disease, infection, and intracranial mass, may be missed if imaging is not considered. Thus, proceeding with magnetic resonance imaging or noncontrast computed tomography is recommended, particularly if select brain features may lead to a differential diagnosis of the type of dementia.\n\n【223】Recommendations for additional testing or procedures are patient specific, on the basis of the components listed previously herein regarding suspicion for other contributing factors. These procedures may commonly include, but are not limited to, ophthalmology testing, cerumen disimpaction, audiology testing, referral for sleep studies, consideration of an antidepressant drug trial (if symptoms are present), referral to a psychiatrist, therapist, or behaviorist, electroencephalography, echocardiography (if an arrhythmia or dysautonomia is suspected), or additional recommendations to minimize polypharmacy.\n\n【224】### Treatment\n\n【225】Treatment of dementia involves a pharmacologic and a nonpharmacologic approach. The pharmacologic treatment of dementia may include medications that are meant to slow the progression of cognitive decline, as methods of neuroprotection and curative treatment are not yet available. Medications may also be used to help with challenging behaviors in adults with I/DD and dementia. Treating affective behavior and psychotic behavior is a challenge that may improve the individual's function, but the benefits must be carefully weighed against potential adverse effects, and one may consider partnering with a psychiatrist for further expert guidance in this situation.\n\n【226】Data specifically focused on pharmacologic treatment interventions for adults with I/DD (and Down syndrome specifically) are limited, with many studies flawed by small sample sizes, nonblinded study design, and variable inclusion criteria for dementia.

Current practice is largely variable and is typically extrapolated from standard treatment principles applied to the general population with dementia. The question of efficacy and response to cholinesterase inhibitor and memantine treatment in the general population is challenging in and of itself, with outcomes often reflected as a modest improvement in cognitive subscale values and measurements of functionality.\n\n【261】Other treatment options are dictated by what is uncovered in the workup of other contributing factors. Treatment of these issues may be quite gratifying, as some underlying issues may be highly improvable, such as correction of vision impairment; cerumen disimpaction; amplification for hearing deficits; initiation of antidepressant drug therapy; initiation or adjustment of thyroid supplementation; adjustment, elimination, or dose reduction of problematic medications; initiation of continuous positive airway pressure or other noninvasive measures for improvement of sleep disorders; behavioral or environmental modifications; and treatment for suspected underlying pain, discomfort, and mobility difficulties. Occupational and physical therapy consults should be considered in helping to enable the individual and care staff to help with current difficulties in activities of daily living and in trying to sustain current levels of function.\n\n【262】Pharmacologic treatment of dementia composes only a portion of the treatment plan. Most of the treatment approach should be nonpharmacologic, via communication and environmental and behavioral strategies. This topic is addressed and outlined in rigorous detail in the article by Jokinen et al,\n\n【263】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【264】*   Jokinen N.\n*   Janicki M.P.\n*   Keller S.M.\n*   et al.\n\n【265】National Task Group on Intellectual Disabilities and Dementia Care Practices  \nGuidelines for structuring community care and supports for people with intellectual disabilities affected by dementia.\n\n【266】_J Policy Pract Intellect Disabil._ 2013; 10 : 1-24\n\n【267】*   Crossref\n*   Scopus (46)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【268】another publication by the NTG.\n\n【269】### Follow-up\n\n【270】At the conclusion of the initial assessment, it is recommended that a follow-up visit be planned to review the results of requested studies and to assess response to any recommended interventions. If there is any question, it is often prudent to suspend any formal diagnosis of dementia until at least the second meeting to allow for proper investigation into other contributing factors in the intervening months.\n\n【271】There is no consensus or formal framework by which a physician treating an individual with I/DD can judge the response to dementia treatment. Outcome measures used in drug studies for adults with Down syndrome and dementia typically include measures of cognition, neuropsychiatric features, adaptive behavior, and scores on subsequent standardized testing. Certainly, assessment of adherence to and tolerance of these medications should be a priority in all first follow-up visits. Thereafter, response to medication and decision making for continuing treatment is judged primarily on the basis of subjective and objective findings during the interview and follow-up memory testing. Because the impact of these drugs is often subtle and the theoretical mechanism is to slow the progression of disease, if the patient is tolerating the medication, it is often generally justifiable to continue treatment until at least moderate-stage disease or beyond.\n\n【272】During the disease course, regular support and education are critical. It is helpful to provide a general estimate of the stage of the disease (early, middle, or late stage) to the caregiver to help provide stage-specific education and expectations. Early-stage disease warrants counseling regarding communication strategies, modification of expectations at home/day/work programs, safety concerns, behavior or personality changes, and adapting the level of supervision and support to account for short-term memory loss.\n\n【273】Anticipatory guidance is necessary to prepare caregivers for changes and for setting realistic expectations going forward. In the early stages of disease, it is recommended to educate caregivers on certain features that commonly accompany progression to midstage, including dysphagia, mobility impairments, new or worsening urinary incontinence, and seizures. When the individual begins to exhibit changes consistent with midstage disease, anticipatory guidance should shift to more goal-directed discussions about future planning, advance directives, and goals of care. Having this discussion proactively allows the caregiver to consider scenarios that may be encountered in late-stage disease while avoiding having to make decisions in a crisis situation.\n\n【274】One important complicating factor that adds a considerable layer of complexity to this discussion when caring for individuals with I/DD is the issue of guardianship or proper identification of a decision maker. The discussion described previously herein would ideally be held in-person during an office encounter with the health care proxy or guardian present. It is common for some older adults with I/DD to have a court-appointed guardian or health care proxy who may be a family member or someone else. Thus, engaging the decision maker in this important discussion may often be easier said than done but is nonetheless extremely important.\n\n【275】Need for Future Research and Study\n----------------------------------\n\n【276】As more individuals with I/DD regularly reach old age, the need for further life span research in this field cannot be overstated. There is a dearth of syndrome-specific information that can provide insight into common coincident conditions encountered as individuals progress into adulthood and old age. There remains conflicting information and uncertainty about the relative risk of dementia for adults with all forms of intellectual disability, and this is a major barrier to proper assessment, risk stratification, and guidance. The emerging field of adult developmental medicine has extensively fertile grounds for research in basic science and clinical areas, especially clinical trials. This field remains small in size but large in passion and commitment. Consensus guidelines are necessary to help standardize assessment practices among health care professionals performing memory assessments in this growing population, and this is one of the primary aims of the NTG. In addition, continued training on life span issues for adults with I/DD needs to be incorporated into the general medical training for providers of adult medicine, and there are other national efforts under way in this regard. Last, the efforts of specialists currently working in this field need to be harnessed in a formal manner and supported through funding opportunities so that efforts such as those undertaken by the NTG can be continued.\n\n【277】Recommendations\n---------------\n\n【278】Similar to other dementia guidelines, the National Task Group Consensus Recommendations emphasize a stepwise and comprehensive assessment of suspected cognitive decline. However, in adults with I/DD, history is of paramount importance, given the great heterogeneity of individual baseline or premorbid functioning. In addition to interviewing the patient, health care professionals are recommended to engage multiple informants who know the individual well and to use additional collateral historical information as available. Finally, the NTG urges health care professionals to arrive on the diagnosis of dementia systematically and thoughtfully, so as not to prematurely close a window of opportunity to discover potentially modifiable and treatable coexisting conditions.\n\n【279】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【280】This document represents the collective efforts of many members of the NTG, with the lead for organizing, synthesizing, and producing the information attributed to the authors.

As described in their study, the authors performed a retrospective analysis of a large (N=227,422) population of US military veterans with non–dialysis-dependent CKD in order to analyze the impact of thyroid status (as defined by TSH measurement) on all-cause mortality. Rather than studying patients with near dialysis dependence, the authors chose to examine mortality in patients with moderate renal dysfunction (CKD stage 3, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 30-60 mL/min per 1.73 m <sup>2 </sup> ), a patient population commonly found in clinical practice.\n\n【32】Importantly, the authors astutely acknowledge that in a population with chronic disease, mortality might reflect concomitant comorbidity burden, with thyroid function test abnormalities a manifestation of what has been frequently referred to as “sick euthyroid syndrome” and now better known as acquired transient central hypothyroidism.\n\n【33】<sup><a>6</a></sup>\n\n【34】*   Chopra I.J.\n\n【35】Clinical review 86; euthyroid sick syndrome: is it a misnomer?.\n\n【36】_J Clin Endocrinol Metab._ 1997; 82 : 329-334\n\n【37】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (315)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【38】To address this issue, Rhee et al performed 2 sensitivity analyses to examine thyroid status and mortality. The first involved the use of a 30-day “lag period” from TSH measurement to follow-up date to minimize the risk for transient changes in TSH levels that were readily reversible; the second used incident cases of thyroid dysfunction.\n\n【39】Overall, assessments of both thyroid status and the potential impact of therapies used to modulate thyroid function were carefully evaluated. As described in the article, the statistical analysis plan was sufficiently detailed and utilized multiple layers of analytical assessment to determine the impact of a large number of variables and potential confounders (eg, laboratory values, demographic variables, comorbidities, nutritional status, thyroid therapies) on the outcome of interest. As an example of the authors' impressive efforts at comprehensiveness is their inclusion of variables that could be construed to reflect physician and patient attentiveness to care such as information regarding whether patients had received influenza vaccination or had prescriptions for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, or statin therapies within the preceding year.\n\n【40】As clearly demonstrated, the authors unequivocally identify a significant association between thyroid dysfunction (both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism) and increased mortality in patients with stage 3 CKD, with an increased risk of death 17% to 27% above the risk identified in euthyroid patients with CKD, over a median follow-up period of 5.5 years. This finding remained fairly consistent both when sensitivity analyses were carried out with the 30-day lag period from time of TSH testing to outcome and when only incident cases of thyroid dysfunction were included. Furthermore, when TSH values were subclassified into 4 broad categories (0.5 to <3.0, 3.0-5.0, >5.0-10.0, and >10 mIU/L), an increased risk of mortality with increasing TSH values was observed. Importantly, similar results were noted for TSH values within the hyperthyroid range with 2 caveats: first, only patients in the subclinical hyperthyroidism group (defined as a TSH level of 0.1 to <0.5 mIU/L) had those results confirmed in sensitivity analyses; and, second, the impact of subclinical hyperthyroidism on mortality was stronger than for overt hyperthyroidism. Not surprisingly, these results led to a U-shaped association of thyroid function/dysfunction with mortality, with TSH values in the 1.7 to 2.1 mIU/L range identified as optimal. Notably, adjustments related to quality of care did not impact the identified associations between thyroid dysfunction and mortality, both with respect to TSH values, which were suppressed (<0.5 mIU/L), and those that started from the upper-normal range (TSH >3.0 mIU/L). Body mass index was identified as a covariate that impacted thyroid function–associated mortality for both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, with a higher risk seen in patients who were classified as overweight (body mass index >25 kg/m <sup>2 </sup> ) or above. Intriguingly, in female patients the impact of hyperthyroidism on mortality was also evinced, whereas an association of hypothyroidism and mortality was not observed. Other notable findings of the study were that the impact of both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism on mortality risk was actually stronger in younger (ie, <60 years) as compared with older individuals, and that pharmacological treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism with thyroid hormone replacement may be beneficial, as levothyroxine treatment was associated with reduced mortality in those who achieved a TSH value within the normal range. Finally, multiple sensitivity analyses revealed results consistent with the main analysis, thereby endorsing the internal validity of the authors' findings.\n\n【41】Collectively, these findings provide reasons for care providers to more carefully consider the relationship between thyroid status and renal function in patients with moderate renal impairment (CKD stage 3), a common finding in clinical practice, particularly in aged patients. Given that the observed increased mortality risk in patients with renal dysfunction contrasts with normal population data in which age-associated subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with longevity,\n\n【42】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【43】*   Atzmon G.\n*   Barzilai N.\n*   Surks M.I.\n*   Gabriely I.\n\n【44】Genetic predisposition to elevated serum thyrotropin is associated with exceptional longevity.\n\n【45】_J Clin Endocrinol Metab._ 2009; 94 : 4768-4775\n\n【46】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (118)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【47】it seems likely that the concomitant occurrence of CKD and thyroid dysfunction must be exerting a negative impact on overall health. The basis for this negative effect, however, remains unknown. Accordingly, this observation warrants closer investigation into potential mechanisms underlying this relationship in order to determine if this association plays a causal role in the increased mortality seen in patients with moderate renal dysfunction. Potential guidance for such investigations may come from studies of the relationship between dialysis-dependent CKD and thyroid function, in which progressive hypothyroidism associates with increased mortality.\n\n【48】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【49】*   Rhee C.M.\n*   Alexander E.K.\n*   Bhan I.\n*   Brunelli S.M.\n\n【50】Hypothyroidism and mortality among dialysis patients.\n\n【51】_Clin J Am Soc Nephrol._ 2013; 8 : 593-601\n\n【52】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (55)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【53】Whether well-recognized pathophysiologic alterations that occur with both hypothyroidism (such as hyperlipidemia, accelerated atherosclerosis, and endothelial dysfunction) and hyperthyroidism (such as increased cardiac demand with resultant ischemia, atrial fibrillation, and cardiac remodeling) are exacerbated even in moderate (CKD stage 3) renal impairment remains an open question.\n\n【54】Once these questions are satisfactorily answered, it will be important to discuss the potential need for a public health policy in which thyroid monitoring is routinely considered in patients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD and also to identify therapeutic approaches that might mitigate this increased mortality risk. In this context, it is germane to recognize that in the population of hypothyroid individuals included in this study who were treated to target TSH levels, the mortality risk was reduced to below that of euthyroid individuals (95% hazard ratio, 0.85-0.91). This finding suggests that the likely low risk of thyroid hormone replacement therapy may be justifiable in patients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD, although this would require formal prospective study. Additional points of consideration include the potential target TSH level, as well as the risk for the development of iatrogenic hyperthyroidism, a risk that would be expected to increase as the TSH target goal was lowered.\n\n【55】Overall, this study provides considerable food for thought. Strengths of the study are myriad and include the use of a very large database with extensive statistical assessment and sensitivity analyses that verified the validity of the data. Additionally, the duration of follow-up was adequate to assess for the primary end point, and access to care was similar for all the individuals. The study is not without limitations, and these are clearly outlined by the authors and are implicit in this type of retrospective study, particularly the finding of association as opposed to causation.\n\n【56】The interesting results reported in this study will require careful consideration if we are to improve the health of the target population. Subsequent studies should pursue TSH screening in patients with non–dialysis-dependent CKD, both to understand the magnitude of the problem and to allow for prospective evaluation. Future research may also benefit from the evaluation of additional parameters such as thyroxine and triiodothyronine values so as to understand whether this additional data provide nuance to the mortality risk prediction models. As the article by Rhee et al clearly demonstrates, there is much to do if we are to understand and harness this new insight and improve the lives of our patients with CKD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Indeed, overarching all this, and in ways that may not have otherwise occurred, the challenge of COVID-19 enabled a sense of unity and shared purpose; teamwork and collaboration across sectors and disciplines; collaboration among governmental agencies, pharmaceutical and other industries, and academic medical centers; the implementation of and reimbursement for telemedicine in health care; the acute recognition of structural weaknesses, inadequacies, and disparities in so many aspects of health care and its systems, and out of such recognition a resolve for needed change; a rediscovery of the fundamental mission of primary care and a reanalysis of ways how it should be optimally restructured; and an emphasis and drive towards creativity and innovation in all aspects of health care and its delivery, embracing, for example, the current capability and inherent potential of digital health initiatives and artificial intelligence.\n\n【2】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【3】*   Farrugia G.\n*   Plutowski R.W.\n\n【4】Innovation lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n【5】_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2020; 95 : 1574-1577\n\n【6】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (28)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【7】COVID-19 has significantly influenced biomedical publishing. The number of submissions to journals, especially general medical journals such as _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , on COVID-19-related topics has markedly increased. While offering the possibility of significantly advancing our understanding of the disease, such COVID-19-related content requires rigorous and expeditious evaluation. This objective may be challenging because the available reviewer pool of experts in COVID-19-related fields may not have increased commensurate with the number of COVID-19 submissions. _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ is especially appreciative of many experts who not only generously serve as reviewers for the abundant COVID-19-related submissions, but also accommodate our requests for expedited reviews. To facilitate timely and free accessibility of accepted COVID-19-related content, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ publishes such content immediately online, without copy editing or type setting, on its website at its Coronavirus (COVID-19) Resource Center. Additionally, in September 2020, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ published a supplemental issue, online only, that comprised 22 articles written by experts at Mayo Clinic and which discussed institutional strategies to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n【8】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【9】*   Berbari E.F.\n*   Williams A.W.\n*   Williamson M.J.\n*   Caine N.A.\n*   Nath K.A.\n*   Farrugia G.\n\n【10】Mayo Clinic strategies for COVID-19: Introduction.\n\n【11】_Mayo Clin Proc._ 2020 Sep; 95 : S1-S2\n\n【12】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (2)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【13】Adaptation, resourcefulness, rapidity and cohesiveness in response, and harnessing technology and innovation—among the salient lessons of COVID-19—are some of the key underpinnings of how medical journals disseminate knowledge now and into the future. This is especially so as regards online journal publication. Online publication possesses in ways entirely unmatched by print publication a rapidity of content appearance; a capacity to swiftly respond to timely and important issues and to improvise with the optimal matching of relevant content; the ability to provide its readers immediacy in electronic linkage to relevant literature and the opportunity for their own analysis of published data and their use of a virtual microscopy to explore anatomic/histologic images. Online publication is eminently positioned to broadly capitalize on the expanding potential of immersive technologies (virtual reality, augmented reality, and mixed reality). And, unlike print publication, online publication is not subject either to the high costs of printing and mailing, the need for repetitive recycling or housing and storage of print copies, or to significant concerns related to climate change and other adverse environmental effects.\n\n【14】After discussions with, endorsement by, and complete support of institutional leadership and its publisher Elsevier, _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ will be published as an online only journal from January 2021 onwards. We encourage readers to keep apprised of the latest content and developments by signing up for alerts at mayoclinicproceedings.org/register. This month thus marks a signal step in the continued progress and evolution of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_ , a journal within 5 years of a centenary of continuous publication. We are excited about serving as best as we can all our readers, authors, and reviewers and providing an online journal that draws upon the finest in the current capability and inestimable potential of the digital age.\n\n【15】We wish everyone health and safety in these exceptionally challenging and uncertain times.\n\n【16】Acknowledgment\n--------------\n\n【17】It is my true privilege to warmly acknowledge the outstanding contributions and dedication of Ms Terry Jopke, Ms Kim Sankey, and Ms Peg Wentz, members of the Editorial Office of _Mayo Clinic Proceedings._", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed in 56 patients (93%). The 4 remaining patients had pelvic adenopathy on computed tomography, which was confirmed histologically in all patients. The median pretreatment prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was 28.8 ng/mL (mean, 55 ng/mL; range, 0.1–428 ng/mL). All patients received radiation therapy to the prostate, and 29 (48%) had pelvic node radiation. Biochemical failure was defined according to the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology criteria of 3 successive increases in the PSA level.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】The median follow-up duration for surviving patients was 101.1 months (range, 20–134 months). Biochemical failure with (in 2 patients) or without (in 10 patients) clinically evident disease relapse was noted in 12 patients (20%). Four additional patients (7%) had clinical relapse without biochemical failure. Local recurrences were observed in 6 patients (10%), and this clinical impression was confirmed by biopsy in 4 patients. Thirteen patients (22%) died of causes related to prostate cancer. The biochemical relapse-free, clinical disease-free, overall, and cause-specific survival rates at 5 years were 82%, 84%, 76%, and 80%, respectively.\n\n【6】### Conclusions\n\n【7】This observational case series of patients treated with the combination of external-beam radiation therapy and permanent androgen ablation for pathologic stage IV prostate cancer suggests that the addition of androgen deprivation therapy to radiation therapy may improve disease outcome. In the absence of randomized trial results, these observations may be beneficial in clinical decision making.\n\n【8】ADT ( androgen deprivation therapy ), CI ( confidence interval ), RT ( radiation therapy )\n\n【9】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【10】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【11】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【12】One-time access price info\n\n【13】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【14】### Subscribe:\n\n【15】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【16】Already a print subscriber?

The headache had begun gradually in the occipital region and radiated to her temples. It was initially dull, rated as 2 on a scale of 0 to 10, and was relieved with use of ibuprofen. However, the day before the patient went to the emergency department, the pain suddenly worsened to 10/ 10, became holocephalic and throbbing, and was unrelieved by ibuprofen or acetaminophen with hydrocodone. She stated that it was the worst headache of her life. She denied having aura, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, fever, neck stiffness, vision change, or loss of consciousness.\n\n【1】The patient's medical history was remarkable only for allergic rhinitis and depression. She had no history of headaches and no head trauma. Her current medications included sertraline (100 mg/d) for depression, intranasal mometasone (0.05 mg, 1 spray daily) and loratadine/pseudoephedrine (10/240 mg/d) for allergic rhinitis, and medroxyprogesterone acetate intramuscular injection every 3 months for contraception. Two weeks previously, she had also begun taking phentermine (37.5 mg/d) for appetite suppression. The patient was a nonsmoker and consumed 1 to 2 alcoholic beverages per week.\n\n【2】Physical examination revealed a healthy-appearing young woman in distress due to pain. The following vital signs were noted: pulse rate, 72/min and regular; blood pressure, 140/80 mm Hg; temperature, 37°C; and respiratory rate, 16/min. Her body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) was 26.9. Neither papilledema nor nuchal rigidity was evident. Examination of the heart, lungs, and abdomen yielded unremarkable results. Findings on neurologic examination, including cranial nerve testing, upper and lower extremity strength, deep tendon reflexes, cerebellar testing, and sensation, were normal.\n\n【3】*   1.\n    \n    **_Based on the patient's clinical presentation, which one of the following is the most important diagnosis to consider?_**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        _Migraine without aura_\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        _Medication-overuse headache_\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        _Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)_\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        _Acute aseptic meningitis_\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        _Tension headache_\n        \n    \n\n【4】The International Headache Society 2004 diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura include at least 5 attacks lasting 4 to 72 hours each during a patient's lifetime.\n\n【5】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【6】*   Olesen J\n\n【7】The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition: application to practice.\n\n【8】_Funct Neurol._ 2005; 20 : 61-68\n\n【9】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【10】The headache must have at least 2 of the following characteristics: unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate or severe intensity, or aggravation by normal daily activities. During the headache, either nausea and vomiting or photophobia and phonophobia must also be experienced. Our patient did not have these associated symptoms and thus did not meet the criteria for migraine without aura. Medication-overuse headache is associated with the use of ergotamine, triptans, over-the-counter analgesics, opioids, or combination medications at least 10 days per month for 3 or more months.\n\n【11】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【12】*   Diener HC\n*   Limmroth V\n\n【13】Medication-overuse headache: a worldwide problem.\n\n【14】_Lancet Neurol._ 2004; 3 : 475-483\n\n【15】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (356)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【16】Clearly, this diagnosis is not consistent with our patient's clinical history.

The pain of SAH is typically described as “the worst headache of my life” and is often associated with vomiting, neck pain, or loss of consciousness. However, a study of emergency department patients with severe abrupt headache and normal findings on neurologic examination revealed that 12% had SAH.\n\n【17】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【18】*   Edlow JA\n\n【19】Diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage in the emergency department.\n\n【20】_Emerg Med Clin North Am._ 2003; 21 : 73-87\n\n【21】*   Abstract\n*   Full Text\n*   Full Text PDF\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (41)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【22】Acute aseptic meningitis typically presents with headache, fever, and signs of meningeal irritation.\n\n【23】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【24】*   Nowak DA\n*   Boehmer R\n*   Fuchs HH\n\n【25】A retrospective clinical, laboratory and outcome analysis in 43 cases of acute aseptic meningitis.\n\n【26】_Eur J Neurol._ 2003; 10 : 271-280\n\n【27】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (70)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【28】The lack of fever and neck stiffness in our patient makes this diagnosis unlikely.

Lumbar puncture performed with the patient in the left lateral decubitus position yielded an opening pressure of 170 mm H <sub>2 </sub> O (reference range, 60-200 mm H <sub>2 </sub> O). The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear, with a protein level of 31 mg/dL (reference range, 14-45 mg/dL), a glucose level of 58 mg/dL (serum glucose, 79 mg/dL), 1 total nucleated cell per microliter, no erythrocytes, negative Gram stain, and no xanthochromia. Intramuscular injection of ketorolac produced some relief, and the patient was discharged with a diagnosis of probable migraine.\n\n【36】The following day, the headache continued and was severe. It was still located in the occipitocervical area and radiated to the temples. The patient consulted a chiropractor, who manipulated her neck. Her pain improved temporarily but did not subside over the next several days, prompting the patient to seek further medical attention. Multiple medications were tried, including acetaminophen with aspirin and caffeine, zolmitriptan, oxycodone with acetaminophen, and sumatriptan. Despite these medications, the severe headache persisted. Ten days after the headache began, the patient returned to the emergency department and was given meperidine, morphine, and diazepam, again with little relief. She continued to deny nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia, fever, vision changes, and neck stiffness.\n\n【37】After no improvement despite multiple medications, the patient was admitted to our hospital for further investigation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed a subacute infarct involving the right anterior cerebral artery/middle cerebral artery border zone, occurring in the watershed area and presumably due to poor perfusion. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck showed a focal high-grade stenosis of the right internal carotid artery approximately 1 cm beyond the carotid bifurcation and a high-grade stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. These findings were consistent with bilateral internal carotid artery dissections. No aneurysm was seen.\n\n【38】*   2.\n    \n    **_Which one of the following is not an appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient?_**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        _Initiation of unfractionated heparin_\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        _Cerebral angiography_\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        _Collagen vascular disease work-up_\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        _Leptomeningeal biopsy_\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        _Surgical repair_\n        \n    \n\n【39】Initial treatment of symptomatic carotid artery dissection is unfractionated heparin, used to prevent thrombus formation on the injured endothelial surface and thereby prevent embolization.

Collagen vascular disease work-up and a leptomeningeal biopsy are also appropriate choices to determine the etiology of the dissection. Surgical repair of the vessel is not indicated at this time and would be considered only after 6 months of medical treatment fails or if symptomatic high-grade stenosis persists.\n\n【46】Unfractionated heparin therapy was initiated. Laboratory investigations yielded the following results (reference ranges shown parenthetically): erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 15 mm/h (0-29 mm/h); C-reactive protein, 0.3 mg/dL (<0.8 mg/dL); and assays for lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody, negative. No monoclonal protein was detected on serum protein electrophoresis. Cryoglobulins, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, myeloperoxidase and proteinase 3 antibodies, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody, and double-stranded DNA antibody were absent, and results of an extractable nuclear antigen antibody panel were negative. Cerebral angiography showed scattered intracranial arterial stenoses of the bilateral vertebral, basilar, bilateral superior cerebellar, and bilateral posterior cerebral arteries in a pattern most consistent with vasculitis. In addition, dissection of bilateral internal carotid arteries had resulted in severe stenoses.\n\n【47】*   3.\n    \n    **_Given the patient's history and laboratory results thus far, which one of the following is the most likely cause of the angiographic findings?_**\n    \n    *   a.\n        \n        _Primary vasculitis of the central nervous system (CNS)_\n        \n    *   b.\n        \n        _Drug-induced vasculitis_\n        \n    *   c.\n        \n        _CNS involvement of systemic vasculitis_\n        \n    *   d.\n        \n        _Adverse effect of chiropractic manipulation_\n        \n    *   e.\n        \n        _Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD)_\n        \n    \n\n【48】Primary vasculitis of the CNS is a specific subset of CNS vasculitis that usually presents with an insidious onset of symptoms over weeks to months rather than days, making this choice unlikely.

Legal and illicit sympathomimetic medications can cause CNS vasculitis and stroke in young adults. Our patient was taking pseudoephedrine daily and had started taking phentermine just before the headache began. Phentermine is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to be taken only for a few weeks as an adjunct to diet and exercise for weight loss. In addition, its safety with coadministration of sertraline has not been established. Therefore, drug-induced vasculitis was the most likely cause of the angiographic findings. The patient had no signs or symptoms of systemic vasculitis and had negative results on studies for collagen vascular disorders, making this diagnosis unlikely. Although 13 cases of internal carotid artery dissection temporally related to chiropractic manipulation have been reported, our patient's pain began before chiropractic manipulation, making this diagnosis extremely unlikely.\n\n【55】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【56】*   Haneline MT\n*   Croft AC\n*   Frishberg BM\n\n【57】Association of internal carotid artery dissection and chiropractic manipulation.\n\n【58】_Neurologist._ 2003; 9 : 35-44\n\n【59】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (39)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【60】Cerebrovascular FMD is typically limited to the internal carotid and vertebral arteries, usually in an extracranial location.\n\n【61】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【62】*   Furie DM\n*   Tien RD\n\n【63】Fibromuscular dysplasia of the arteries of the head and neck: imaging findings.\n\n【64】_AJR Am J Roentgenol._ 1994; 162 : 1205-1209\n\n【65】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (60)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【66】It is often described as having the appearance of a “string of beads,” which was lacking in our patient.

Parenteral methylprednisolone was initiated in the hospital and then switched to prednisone. The patient's headache resolved within days.

Lumbar puncture can be used to detect red blood cells in the CSF, but this test is invasive and too cumbersome as a first-line test to rule out bleeding. Data from some recent small studies have shown that MRI is likely at least as good as noncontrast CT at detecting hemorrhage. However, many practitioners do not have quick access to MRI. As a first-line test for bleeding, MRI of the brain remains nonstandard practice. Computed tomographic angiography of the cerebral arteries is useful for the diagnosis of vascular occlusions responsible for acute ischemic stroke and may be helpful for guiding thrombolytic therapy. Cerebral angiography is helpful in diagnosing arterial stenosis that may lead to strokes and is the gold standard for detecting underlying brain aneurysm in patients evaluated for SAH. It is not the best test to perform first in our patient.\n\n【91】Noncontrast CT of the brain showed an acute subdural hematoma along the cerebral falx with extension onto both tentorial leafs. Anticoagulation was discontinued, and fresh frozen plasma was administered to correct the international normalized ratio. The patient was observed and had no further signs or symptoms of worsening intracranial bleeding. At hospital discharge, prednisone was prescribed for treatment of drug-induced vasculitis, and the dose was tapered over 6 months. Repeated MRI and MRA of the brain 6 weeks after discharge showed complete resolution of the tentorial subdural hematoma and near resolution of the previous areas of intracerebral and carotid artery stenoses.\n\n【92】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【93】Vasculitis of the CNS is classified as either primary or secondary. The secondary causes include infection, malignancy, systemic vasculitis, connective tissue disease, and drugs.

Of these patients, 1854 were consecutively enrolled in the study. Patients were categorized into 4 groups: the hypoglycemic group (FPG, ≤90.0 mg/dL \\[to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.0555\\]; n=443, 23.9%), the euglycemic group (FPG, 90.1-126.0 mg/dL; n=812, 43.8%), the mildly hyperglycemic group (FPG, 126.1-162.0 mg/dL; n=308, 16.6%), and the severely hyperglycemic group (FPG, ≥162.1 mg/dL; n=291, 15.7%).

Men tended to have a higher frequency of hypoglycemia, whereas women tended to have a higher frequency of hyperglycemia. No significant difference was found in in-hospital (10.9% vs 9.1%; _P_ \\=.36) or 3-year (24.5% vs 24.5%; _P_ \\=.99) mortality between male and female patients, and FPG-associated mortality did not vary significantly by sex.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】An increased FPG level was associated with a relatively higher risk of in-hospital mortality in men but not in women. Nonetheless, increased and decreased FPG levels at admission could predict higher mortality rates regardless of sex. There was a striking U-shaped relationship between FPG levels and in-hospital and 3-year mortality.

They identified 58 patients with AAV diagnosed between 1996 and 2015 and 174 controls (average age, 61 years in both groups) and assessed differences in cardiovascular outcomes between cases and controls. Reassuringly, their findings fall in line with those of previous studies, and even more importantly, they feel like “common sense” results. Their primary conclusion—that AAVs are indeed associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events—should surprise no one; these are, after all, vasculitides that inflame and injure blood vessels. Considering the diffuse vascular damage AAVs can inflict, the results of the study seem undramatic and predictable; cardiovascular problems occurred 3 times more often, cerebrovascular accidents were more than 8 times more frequent, and VT was increased. Isn’t this exactly what you'd expect from arteries and veins ravaged by vasculitis?\n\n【43】The authors' findings provide clarity and insight into a rare medical condition, and their data leave little doubt that AAVs are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular complications. But how do we use this information clinically? Can it guide therapy? For example, as a vascular physician who treats patients with rare diseases like this, a question I might ask is, “Given the increased risk of cardiovascular events, should antiplatelet/anticoagulant drugs be routinely administered to patients diagnosed with AAVs?” The study by Berti et al raises this question, but does it suggest an answer?\n\n【44】Let's start with cardiac events. According to the authors these events occur more than 3 times more frequently in patients with AAVs compared with controls, and the absolute numbers appear clinically relevant (ie, cardiac events developed in over 35% of patients by 10 years with the highest incidence occurring in the first 2 years, after which a gradual decline occurred). Although they cite literature indicating an increased risk of accelerated atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with AAVs, this conclusion is not supported by the authors' findings (there was no difference in coronary disease and/or MI between groups). The most common events were congestive heart failure and, to a lesser extent, atrial fibrillation. These findings complicate therapeutic decision making because patients with coronary atherosclerosis from any cause are usually given antiplatelet therapy. But is the aggressive use of antiplatelet therapy in these patients (who appear predisposed to heart failure and atrial fibrillation more than coronary disease or MI) appropriate? And if you believe that antiplatelet drugs are appropriate, should an aggressive drug regimen—for example, dual antiplatelet therapy—be given during the initial 2-year period when the rate of cardiac events is highest?\n\n【45】The situation with cerebrovascular accidents is different. The relative risk of stroke (all ischemic, no hemorrhagic) in patients with AVVs was elevated more than 4-fold, with an absolute risk of roughly 15% over 10 years (lower than the absolute risk for cardiac events). In patients with “conventional” atherosclerotic-associated cerebral vascular disease, the standard practice is to give indefinite antiplatelet therapy when possible. Does this approach make sense here? Do patients with vasculitis need more aggressive antiplatelet (or even antithrombotic) therapy? Or less?\n\n【46】Finally, consider VT. In this study, the relative risk of VT in patients with AAVs was more than 3 times greater than in controls, but the absolute risk was only 10% over 10 years. The data show that much of this risk (perhaps half?) occurs during the first 3 to 6 months after diagnosis, making this a relatively high-risk period (the absolute risk during the first 6 months appears to be in the range of 5%-10% per year). While there is no universally agreed upon threshold for initiating drug prophylaxis against VT in other settings, a thrombosis risk greater than 3% is considered by some to be grounds for continuing prophylactic anticoagulation in patients with previous deep venous thrombosis (DVT)/pulmonary embolism.\n\n【47】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【48】*   Fahrni J.\n*   Husmann M.\n*   Gretener S.B.\n*   Keo H.H.\n\n【49】Assessing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism—a practical approach.\n\n【50】_Vasc Health Risk Manag._ 2015; 11 : 451-459\n\n【51】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【52】Perhaps there's a reasonable case to be made for initiating _prophylactic_ anticoagulation following the diagnosis of an AAV?\n\n【53】If their goal was to make me worry about cardiovascular complications in my patients with AAVs, the authors have succeeded. I'm officially worried. But worse, I’m confused. For vascular problems caused by common risk factors, there are clinical trials, meta-analyses, and many studies to help guide my decisions. Even so, I'm often unsure about the best approaches to therapy. The situation is far more difficult when a rare disease is involved. There aren’t randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover studies looking at the effectiveness of various treatment modalities on the cardiovascular complications associated with AAVs, and there never will be. I'm going to spend the rest of my career speculating, extrapolating, and ultimately prescribing therapies based on uncertainty and bias. The authors have convinced me that the risk of cardiovascular events is increased in patients with AAVs. I’m equally convinced that the next time I see a patient with an AAV I’ll sleep a little less soundly because of this knowledge.\n\n【54】Despite our uncertainties about the treatment of cardiovascular problems in this setting, we still need to do something. Do we use a course of dual antiplatelet therapy to prevent early cardiac events? Give aspirin to prevent stroke? Treat with anticoagulants to prevent DVT? Which agents should we use? At what doses? Do we combine therapies? How long do we treat? Or do we do nothing? The answer, of course, is “nobody knows.” We are forced to open a therapeutic door and hope that the lady emerges, and not the tiger.\n\n【55】Will this article change my practice? I think so. In the future, I'll probably recommend “triple therapy” for patients with newly diagnosed AAVs (and no contraindications to treatment). First, low-dose aspirin (given indefinitely) to prevent cardiac and cerebrovascular events. Second, prophylactic direct oral anticoagulants for 3 to 6 months (or until the vasculitis has resolved) to prevent DVT. And third? A large bottle of sleeping pills. They're for me.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

Patients with panic disorder often, but not always, have palpitations. The diagnosis is usually made on the basis of a thorough history and psychiatric evaluation. In this patient, panic disorder would be a diagnosis of exclusion after organic causes were excluded. Patients with mitral valve prolapse may have palpitations. This diagnosis is confirmed via echocardiography, and ECG abnormalities may be absent. Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia is the most common form of regular supraventricular tachycardia. In atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, the ECG shows a narrow, complex, regular QRS configuration.\n\n【14】The patient's ECG demonstrated 4 wide complex beats at a rate of 150 beats/min without P waves, consistent with NSVT. This was followed by a slower wide complex idioventricular rhythm changing to a narrow complex rhythm with P waves for each QRS complex, consistent with sinus rhythm. Palpitations are a common, nonspecific symptom. They can be benign or associated with life-threatening arrhythmias. In this patient, the absence of syncope or presyncope, which would be concerning for hemodynamic instability, is reassuring.

Further evaluation is needed to identify the frequency and duration of the patient's rhythm disturbances as well as their etiology and any contributing factors. An external event recorder is useful in patients with paroxysmal symptoms to evaluate for an occult rhythm abnormality. In our patient, arrhythmia has already been documented, so an event recorder would have limited usefulness. A stress test is helpful in evaluating for exercise-induced ischemia. It can also determine whether an arrhythmia is exacerbated with exertion. If the patient had runs of sustained VT, this would be detected as well. Although VT associated with ischemia would more typically be polymorphic than monomorphic, in this patient with multiple cardiac risk factors, it is important to evaluate for ischemia and to further characterize the nature of his arrhythmia. A stress test is a reasonable method of obtaining this information and should be performed next. Coronary angiography is the criterion standard for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease as well as hemodynamic evaluation. However, more evidence of ischemia, such as a positive stress test result, would be prudent before performing such an invasive procedure. Although echocardiography would be useful in determining cardiac function as well as evaluating for structural heart disease, it cannot detect ischemia. Echocardiography would be helpful in this patient, but a stress test should be performed first. A 24-hour Holter monitor can provide evidence of the extent of the patient's NSVT. It would also identify any sustained ventricular arrhythmia, which would change management in this patient. Although Holter monitoring should be obtained in this patient, an ischemic etiology should be ruled out first.\n\n【17】The patient underwent an exercise sestamibi scan, which was negative for stress-induced ischemia. He had exercise-induced NSVT of up to 8 beats. Subsequent echocardiography showed a left ventricular ejection freaction of 62%. The patient underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring. The device recorded 94,083 total beats, 22,080 of which (23%) were ventricular beats.

The underlying cause is thought to be multifactorial, including structural abnormalities, longstanding abnormal cardiac hemodynamics, and fibrosis from corrective surgeries.\n\n【21】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【22】*   Walsh E.P.\n*   Cecchin F.\n\n【23】Arrhythmias in adult patients with congenital heart disease.\n\n【24】_Circulation._ 2007; 115 : 534-545\n\n【25】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (309)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【26】Our patient has no history of CHD, no signs of structural abnormalities on echocardiography, and no history of cardiac surgery.\n\n【27】Brugada syndrome is caused by a sequence variation in cardiac sodium channels. There is no associated structural abnormality. It leads to an increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), and patients who have had syncope or documented arrhythmia should be referred for placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. It is characterized by a pseudo right BBB pattern on ECG with persistent ST elevation in leads V <sub>1 </sub> through V <sub>3 </sub> . This pattern was not evident on our patient's ECG.\n\n【28】Nonsustained VT often occurs in patients experiencing an acute MI. It is usually due to abnormal automaticity in the peri-infarct region and is most common within the first 48 hours. However, our patient has no evidence of ischemia. It is commonly seen in patients with CHF and is thought to be associated with increased mortality in patients with ischemic and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Our patient had no echocardiographic signs of CHF. In the absence of ischemia, any structural heart disease, or electrochemical abnormality, the most likely cause of this patient's arrhythmia is a focal ectopy causing episodic NSVT and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). The monomorphic nature of the ectopy further supports a single focus of automaticity. In our patient, the QRS morphology showed an inferior axis, right BBB, and a predominant R wave in leads II, III, aVF, and V <sub>1 </sub> through V <sub>6 </sub> , suggesting a focus in the left ventricular outflow tract.\n\n【29】*   4\n    \n    **For _initial treatment_ of this patient's symptoms, which _one_ of the following is _most appropriate_ ?**\n    \n    *   a\n        \n        Metoprolol\n        \n    *   b\n        \n        Flecainide\n        \n    *   c\n        \n        Radiofrequency ablation\n        \n    *   d\n        \n        Amiodarone\n        \n    *   e\n        \n        Placement of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD)\n        \n    \n\n【30】Many patients with palpitations related to NSVT can be treated with medical management and achieve resolution of their symptoms. Others may require invasive treatment, but barring contraindications, conservative therapy should be attempted first. Metoprolol is a cardioselective β-blocker used in the treatment of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and CHF. It acts by antagonizing the β <sub>1 </sub> \\-receptors and inhibiting sympathetic activation of the heart. It is an effective treatment to reduce symptoms in patients with palpitations related to NSVT and would be the first choice in our patient.\n\n【31】Flecainide is a class IC antiarrhythmic that acts by binding the intracellular portion of voltage-gated sodium channels.

Until ischemia is ruled out, class IC antiarrhythmics are contraindicated. If ischemia and structural heart disease are excluded, it could be used with caution. Radiofrequency ablation for monomorphic NSVT originating from the right ventricular outflow tract, as seen in our patient, has been shown to be effective in 75% to 100% of patients.\n\n【38】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【39】*   Klein L.S.\n*   Shih H.T.\n*   Hackett F.K.\n*   Zipes D.P.\n*   Miles W.M.\n\n【40】Radiofrequency catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in patients without structural heart disease.\n\n【41】_Circulation._ 1992; 85 : 1666-1674\n\n【42】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (470)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【43】There is limited long-term data regarding recurrence. An initial trial of medical therapy would be reasonable before contemplating ablation in this patient. Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic that acts by inhibiting potassium channels and thus prolonging repolarization. Amiodarone has several highly active metabolites and is effective in suppressing ventricular ectopy. It has a significant adverse effect profile including pulmonary fibrosis and thyroid dysfunction, making it a less attractive therapeutic option.\n\n【44】Placement of an AICD has been shown to reduce mortality when compared with optimal medical management by preventing SCD in certain groups of patients with cardiomyopathy or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Based on the available clinical data, there is no evidence to suggest that our patient would benefit from AICD implantation at this time.\n\n【45】Oral metoprolol tartrate, 25 mg twice daily, was prescribed for palpitations associated with NSVT.\n\n【46】*   5\n    \n    **Which _one_ of the following would be the _most reasonable_ follow-up plan for this patient?**\n    \n    *   a\n        \n        No further follow-up is necessary\n        \n    *   b\n        \n        ECG in 3 to 6 months\n        \n    *   c\n        \n        24-Hour Holter monitoring in 6 to 12 months\n        \n    *   d\n        \n        Echocardiography and 24-hour Holter monitoring in 6 to 12 months\n        \n    *   e\n        \n        Stress test in 6 to 12 months\n        \n    \n\n【47】Aside from palpitations, the patient is completely asymptomatic without syncope, light-headedness, or signs of CHF. However, given his frequent PVCs and NSVT, there is a potential for development of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. Close follow-up would allow early detection of any deterioration in his cardiac function and would be reasonable in this case. Repeated ECG is unlikely to be useful because the arrhythmia has already been diagnosed. It does not provide information regarding the frequency of his ectopy or his cardiac function. 24-Hour Holter monitoring would provide insight into the patient's ectopy and whether his NSVT has changed in frequency or duration. However, in order to detect any deterioration of cardiac function from possible tachycardia, an imaging study such as echocardiography is also required. A stress test would help evaluate for coronary artery disease; however, development of new ischemia is unlikely in such a short time interval. A stress test would detect whether the arrhythmia is exacerbated by exertion, but this could also be inferred from 24-hour Holter monitoring, and exacerbation was not observed on his previous stress test.\n\n【48】Discussion\n----------\n\n【49】Premature ventricular contractions and NSVT are common cardiac rhythm disturbances that are frequently seen in clinical practice. They occur when a focus of automaticity causes premature depolarization in the ventricle. When found incidentally, they are often considered benign; however, the presence of such ectopy can be associated with increased risk of SCD, can be a sign of underlying cardiomyopathy, or in severe cases can lead to tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. One study found a greater than 50% prevalence of PVCs among healthy subjects, while the prevalence of NSVT was 2%.\n\n【50】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【51】*   Sobotka P.A.\n*   Mayer J.H.\n*   Bauernfeind R.A.\n*   Kanakis Jr, C.\n*   Rosen K.M.\n\n【52】Arrhythmias documented by 24-hour continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in young women without apparent heart disease.\n\n【53】_Am Heart J._ 1981; 101 : 753-759\n\n【54】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (145)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【55】Primary care physicians should be familiar with the presenting signs and symptoms, know when further workup and treatment are indicated, and understand which patients are at increased risk of mortality.\n\n【56】Nonsustained VT can be monomorphic, suggesting that it emanates from a single focus, or polymorphic.

In asymptomatic patients, NSVT is often discovered incidentally when frequent premature beats are noted on routine physical examination or when a baseline ECG is obtained. In symptomatic patients with infrequent symptoms, a loop recorder may be useful to obtain ECG data during an episode. In patients with frequent NSVT, 24-hour Holter monitoring is helpful to evaluate for sustained VT as well as to quantify the number of ventricular premature beats. In such cases, the sites of origin as well as the frequency of ventricular ectopy are important because they may be useful for prognosis and in determining which patients will have progression to cardiomyopathy.

Rarely, antiarrhythmic drugs can be used. When NSVT is found, it is important to rule out associated structural heart disease that would put the patient at increased risk for SCD, such as ischemic, dilated, or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Such patients should be considered for AICD implantation. Primary prevention of SCD with AICD implantation is often a complex decision but is usually indicated in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who have at least 2 of 5 high-risk features: (1) maximum left ventricular wall thickness greater than 30 mm, (2) personal history of ventricular arrhythmias, (3) unexplained syncope in the past 6 months, (4) exertional hypotension, and (5) family history of sudden death. In patients with only 1 of these 5 risk factors, the risks vs benefits of AICD implantation are much more problematic.

A paramedic, blinded to treatment, recorded vomiting episodes during transport. Patients, also blinded to treatment, rated their levels of pain, nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and overall satisfaction with their care on 100-mm visual analog scales, with greater values indicating more intense sensation. Results from the 2 groups were compared with χ <sup>2 </sup> or unpaired 2-tailed _t_ tests and presented as means ± SDs.\n\n【4】### Results\n\n【5】Before randomization, patients subsequently assigned to receive oxygen had significantly greater pain and nausea.

Alcoholic hepatitis is diagnosed predominantly on clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory testing, although liver biopsy is often necessary to secure the diagnosis. The major focus of management is abstinence from alcohol, supportive care, treatment of complications of infection and portal hypertension, and maintenance of positive nitrogen balance through nutritional support. Corticosteroid therapy is controversial but should be considered in patients with a discriminant function greater than 32 and/or presence of spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy in the absence of infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and renal failure. The only curative therapy for advanced alcoholic cirrhosis is liver transplantation. Several recent advances in understanding the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease may lead to novel future treatment approaches, including inhibition of tumor necrosis factor a, antioxidant therapy, stimulation of liver regeneration, and stimulation of collagen degradation.\n\n【1】ALT ( alanine aminotransferase ), AST ( aspartate amino-transferase ), CAGE ( alcoholism screening tool containing 4 structured questions ), DF ( discriminant function ), GI ( gastrointestinal ), MCV ( mean corpuscular volume ), NF-κB ( nuclear factor κB ), TNF ( tumor necrosis factor )\n\n【2】CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS\n------------------\n\n【3】### Clinical Spectrum\n\n【4】Alcoholic liver disease spans a clinical and histological spectrum, from fatty liver to alcoholic hepatitis to alcoholic cirrhosis. Fatty liver develops in most people who abuse alcohol for a period of days. However, this condition is generally asymptomatic and entirely reversible with abstinence. Although the majority of people who abuse alcohol for an extended duration do not develop advanced lesions of alcoholic liver disease, approximately 15% to 20% develop alcoholic hepatitis and/or cirrhosis, which may develop in succession or exist concomitantly. The level of alcohol consumption necessary for the development of these advanced forms of alcoholic liver disease is probably 80 g of alcohol per day, the equivalent to 6 to 8 drinks daily for several years.\n\n【5】<sup><a>1</a></sup>\n\n【6】*   Savolainen VT\n*   Liesto K\n*   Mannikko A\n*   Penttila A\n*   Karhunen PJ\n\n【7】Alcohol consumption and alcoholic liver disease: evidence of a threshold level of effects of ethanol.\n\n【8】_Alcohol Clin Exp Res._ 1993; 17 : 1112-1117\n\n【9】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (138)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【10】Women have a significantly higher risk of developing alcoholic liver disease than do men for any given level of alcohol intake\n\n【11】<sup><a>2</a></sup>\n\n【12】*   Becker U\n*   Deis A\n*   Sorensen TI\n*   et al.\n\n【13】Prediction of risk of liver disease by alcohol intake, sex, and age: a prospective population study.\n\n【14】_Hepatology._ 1996; 23 : 1025-1029\n\n【15】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【16】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【17】<sup><a>3</a></sup>\n\n【18】*   Loft S\n*   Olesen KL\n*   Dossing M\n\n【19】Increased susceptibility to liver disease in relation to alcohol consumption in women.\n\n【20】_Scand J Gastroenterol._ 1987; 22 : 1251-1256\n\n【21】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (70)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【22】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【23】<sup><a>4</a></sup>\n\n【24】*   Morgan MY\n*   Sherlock S\n\n【25】Sex-related differences among 100 patients with alcoholic liver disease.\n\n【26】_BMJ._ 1977; 1 : 939-941\n\n【27】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (196)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【28】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【29】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【30】*   McCullough AJ\n\n【31】Alcoholic liver disease.\n\n【32】in: Schiff ER Sorrell MF Maddrey WC 8th ed.

Specific genetic polymorphisms have been detected in patients with alcoholic liver disease, most notably mutations in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) promoter and mutations in alcohol-metabolizing enzyme systems, including alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and the microsomal ethanol oxidizing system.\n\n【41】<sup><a>7</a></sup>\n\n【42】*   Grove J\n*   Daly AK\n*   Bassendine MF\n*   Day CP\n\n【43】Association of a tumor necrosis factor promoter polymorphism with susceptibility to alcoholic steatohepatitis.\n\n【44】_Hepatology._ 1997; 26 : 143-146\n\n【45】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (252)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【46】Infection with hepatitis C virus also increases the severity of liver injury in patients with alcoholic liver disease,\n\n【47】<sup><a>8</a></sup>\n\n【48】*   Pares A\n*   Barrera JM\n*   Caballeria J\n*   et al.\n\n【49】Hepatitis C virus antibodies in chronic alcoholic patients: association with severity of liver injury.\n\n【50】_Hepatology._ 1990; 12 : 1295-1299\n\n【51】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (218)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【52】and some studies suggest that obesity may be a risk factor.\n\n【53】<sup><a>9</a></sup>\n\n【54】*   Naveau S\n*   Giraud V\n*   Borotto E\n*   Aubert A\n*   Capron F\n*   Chaput JC\n\n【55】Excess weight risk factor for alcoholic liver disease.\n\n【56】_Hepatology._ 1997; 25 : 108-111\n\n【57】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (551)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【58】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【59】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【60】*   Iturriaga H\n*   Bunout D\n*   Hirsch S\n*   Ugarte G\n\n【61】Overweight as a risk factor or a predictive sign of histological liver damage in alcoholics.\n\n【62】_Am J Clin Nutr._ 1988; 47 : 235-238\n\n【63】*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (70)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【64】Table 1 Relative Risk of Alcoholic Liver Disease at Different Levels of Alcohol Intake\n\n【65】Reprinted with permission from McCullough.\n\n【66】<sup><a>5</a></sup>\n\n【67】*   McCullough AJ\n\n【68】Alcoholic liver disease.\n\n【69】in: Schiff ER Sorrell MF Maddrey WC 8th ed.

However, this determination is not always straightforward. Alcoholic patients and even their family members often minimize or conceal alcohol use. Interrogation of multiple family members is often necessary to uncover the true level of alcohol consumption. Additionally, different caregivers often obtain disparate histories from the patient because of the relationship between the patient and caregiver, the level of trust, and the approach and persistence caregivers may use in obtaining the alcohol history. Questionnaires have been used to clarify alcohol use and abuse syndromes. Some of these, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory substance abuse scale\n\n【77】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【78】*   Hays RD\n*   Revetto JP\n\n【79】Old and new MMPI-derived scales and the short-MAST as screening tools for alcohol disorder.\n\n【80】_Alcohol Alcohol._ 1992; 27 : 685-695\n\n【81】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【82】and the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test,\n\n【83】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【84】*   Storgaard H\n*   Nielsen SD\n*   Gluud C\n\n【85】The validity of the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST).\n\n【86】_Alcohol Alcohol._ 1994; 29 : 493-502\n\n【87】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【88】have been used predominantly for research purposes because of their length.

Any positive responses to these inquiries require more detailed investigation and raise the possibility of alcohol abuse.\n\n【95】However, the CAGE questionnaire, like any history-gathering tool, is susceptible to patient deception. Because of the inherent difficulties in obtaining a reliable history of alcohol use, various biochemical markers have been evaluated for their ability to detect surreptitious alcohol abuse. Most of the traditional serologic markers of alcohol abuse are based on indirect assessment of alcohol abuse through evaluation of liver injury. These include elevations in the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotrans-ferase (ALT) levels, the elevated AST/ALT ratio, and the elevated ?-glutamyltransferase level. However, because these tests assess alcohol abuse indirectly via detection of liver injury, they have diminished sensitivity and specificity, generally less than 70%. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is also elevated with alcohol abuse because of the bone marrow toxicity of alcohol, although its sensitivity as a marker of alcohol use is generally lower than 50%.\n\n【96】<sup><a>14</a></sup>\n\n【97】*   Mundle G\n*   Ackermann K\n*   Munkes J\n*   Steinle D\n*   Mann K\n\n【98】Influence of age, alcohol consumption and abstinence on the sensitivity of carbohydrate-deficient transferrin, gamma-glutamyltransferase and mean corpuscular volume.\n\n【99】_Alcohol Alcohol._ 1999; 34 : 760-766\n\n【100】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (56)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【101】Because of these inherent limitations in diagnostic accuracy, newer tests have been evaluated for their ability to detect alcohol abuse.\n\n【102】<sup><a>15</a></sup>\n\n【103】*   Lumeng L\n\n【104】New diagnostic markers of alcohol abuse.\n\n【105】_Hepatology._ 1986; 6 : 742-745\n\n【106】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (46)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【107】These include carbohydrate-deficient transferrin and mitochondrial AST as well as ratios utilizing these factors in conjunction with total transferrin and AST, respectively.

Prolonged alcohol abuse results in alcoholic hepatitis. The history of patients with this condition is notable for various constitutional symptoms, such as fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss, and other nonspecific symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting. Severe alcoholic hepatitis may be evident by advanced symptoms relating to portal hypertension, including gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy. Elicitation of risk factors for concomitant or alternative forms of acute and chronic hepatitis, such as viral hepatitis, Wilson disease, and drug-induced hepatitis, is important. Physical examination of patients with alcoholic hepatitis is most notable for hepatomegaly. Other findings depend on the severity of liver insult and may include jaundice, splenomegaly, hepatic bruits, collateral vessels, and ascites. Alcoholic cirrhosis may occur before, concomitant with, after, or independent of a bout of alcoholic hepatitis. The clinical history is similar to that of alcoholic hepatitis, and symptoms are similar to those observed with other forms of end-stage liver disease. Additionally, poor nutritional status, peripheral neuropathy, dementia, or cardiomyopathy may coexist because of the extrahepatic toxicities of alcohol abuse.\n\n【133】### Laboratory Values and Imaging Studies\n\n【134】Although specific laboratory abnormalities reflect the severity of alcohol-induced liver injury and have prognostic utility, others are useful only diagnostically. Transaminase levels are elevated less than 5 to 10 times the normal value in the absence of concomitant acetaminophen abuse. Additionally, the AST level is almost always greater than the ALT level, and a reversal of this ratio suggests the presence of concomitant viral hepatitis or alternatively the presence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.\n\n【135】<sup><a>19</a></sup>\n\n【136】*   Sorbi D\n*   Boynton J\n*   Lindor KD\n\n【137】The ratio of aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase: potential value in differentiating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis from alcoholic liver disease.\n\n【138】_Am J Gastroenterol._ 1999; 94 : 1018-1022\n\n【139】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【140】Both the modest level of increase and the predominance of the AST level help to distinguish alcoholic hepatitis from acute viral hepatitis. However, transaminase levels alone have no prognostic utility. In more moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis, prothrombin time and bilirubin level are also elevated, and the presence of leukocytosis and right upper abdominal quadrant discomfort may mimic biliary tract disease. In contrast to the transaminase levels, the pro-thrombin time and bilirubin level reflect the severity of alcoholic hepatitis and are of prognostic importance. Several groups have attempted to use the bilirubin level and prothrombin time as well as other laboratory variables to assess prognosis of patients with alcoholic hepatitis. The simplest and most effective of these assessments is the Maddrey discriminant function (DF) analysis \\[DF = 4.6 (prothrombin time in seconds − control) + serum bilirubin (mg/dL)\\]. An increase in DF of more than 32 effectively identifies patients at a high risk of death, more than 50%. The Child-Pugh score and the Combined Clinical Laboratory Index have also been used effectively in this manner.\n\n【141】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【142】*   Christensen E\n*   Schlichting P\n*   Fauerholdt L\n*   et al.\n\n【143】Prognostic value of Child-Turcotte criteria in medically treated cirrhosis.\n\n【144】_Hepatology._ 1984; 4 : 430-435\n\n【145】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (286)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【146】<sup>,</sup>\n\n【147】<sup><a>21</a></sup>\n\n【148】*   Orrego H\n*   Israel Y\n*   Blake JE\n*   Medline A\n\n【149】Assessment of prognostic factors in alcoholic liver disease: toward a global quantitative expression of severity.\n\n【150】_Hepatology._ 1983; 3 : 896-905\n\n【151】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (175)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【152】Doppler ultrasonography is often a useful adjunct to exclude alternative diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, biliary obstruction, and hepatic vein thrombosis, which may result in some overlapping clinical symptoms particularly in the absence of an accurate alcohol history.

However, in some patients, biopsy may be performed to determine the degree of advancement of alcoholic liver disease and to exclude the presence of cirrhosis.

Patients who recover from alcoholic hepatitis and maintain abstinence may evidence continuing improvement in clinical sequelae and laboratory variables for as long as 6 months.

Maintenance of positive nitrogen balance and provision of adequate energy requirements through nutritional support are vital.\n\n【211】Additionally, protein and energy needs are generally increased in patients with alcoholic hepatitis because of stress of illness and underlying malnutrition. However, provision of nutrients in excess of calculated requirements is unlikely to be of additional benefit. Enteral provision of adequate calories is optimal. However, in patients with severe disease, anorexia and encephalopathy may precipitate the need for parenteral supplements. Additionally, parenteral nutritional support may be necessary in patients with ileus and coma, although the survival benefit of parenteral nutritional supplementation in such patients is not established because of iatrogenic complications that can arise concomitant with parenteral access, most notably a propensity for nosocomial infection. Generally, encephalopathy should not be a cause for protein restriction, and most patients can tolerate a 60-g protein diet. In patients in whom severe encephalopathy is exacerbated by dietary protein, branched chain amino acid supplements or vegetable protein substitution should be considered. Some studies suggest that androgenic anabolic steroids such as oxandrolone may be of use in malnourished patients; however, more studies are needed to confirm this approach.\n\n【212】<sup><a>27</a></sup>\n\n【213】*   Alexander JF\n*   Lischner MW\n*   Galambos JT\n\n【214】Natural history of alcoholic hepatitis, II: the long-term prognosis.\n\n【215】_Am J Gastro-enterol._ 1971; 56 : 515-525\n\n【216】*   PubMed\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【217】### Portal Hypertension\n\n【218】Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and those with isolated alcoholic hepatitis may develop complications of portal hypertension.

Malnutrition, underlying liver cirrhosis, and aggressive in-hospital medical procedures all contribute to the risk of infection. Additionally, alcohol-induced gut permeability to microbes probably contributes to this risk. Because of their relative degree of immunocompromise, patients with alcoholic hepatitis must be evaluated carefully for infections and treated aggressively. Particularly frequent infectious insults include spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, aspiration pneumonia, and lower extremity cellulitis.\n\n【227】### Liver Transplantation\n\n【228】Alcoholic liver disease is currently the second most common indication for liver transplantation in the United States. Despite popular opinion, patients who undergo transplantation because of alcoholic liver disease have excellent survival rates posttransplantation, superceded only by survival rates observed in patients who undergo transplantation because of chronic cholestatic liver disease.\n\n【229】<sup><a>30</a></sup>\n\n【230】*   Pereira SP\n*   Williams R\n\n【231】Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease at King's College Hospital: survival and quality of life.\n\n【232】_Liver Transpl Surg._ 1997; 3 : 245-250\n\n【233】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (24)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【234】A major issue in maintaining excellent outcomes in this patient population is identifying candidates with a low risk of recidivism after transplantation because alcohol abuse after liver transplantation can result in rapid development of cirrhosis in the graft, interfere in the compliance and bio-availability of immunosuppressive medications, and alter the perceptions of the general public and potential organ donors in a detrimental way.\n\n【235】<sup><a>31</a></sup>\n\n【236】*   Lucey MR\n\n【237】Issues in selection for and outcome of liver transplantation in patients with alcoholic liver disease.\n\n【238】_Liver Transpl Surg._ 1997; 3 : 227-230\n\n【239】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (11)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【240】Most studies suggest that alcohol relapse after transplantation occurs in 15% to 30% of patients.\n\n【241】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【242】*   Hoofnagle JH\n*   Kresina T\n*   Fuller RK\n*   et al.\n\n【243】Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease: executive statement and recommendations: summary of a National Institutes of Health workshop held December 6–7, 1996, Bethesda, Maryland.\n\n【244】_Liver Transpl Surg._ 1997; 3 : 347-350\n\n【245】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (56)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【246】Although this figure may be low because many patients do not admit to relapse, the low incidence of observed graft injury and loss due to recurrent alcoholic liver disease suggest that most of these patients do not drink alcohol to an extent that is detrimental to their graft and health. Selection of appropriate patients for liver transplantation requires a team approach, including a hepatologist, surgeon, addiction specialist, psychiatrist, and social worker. At present, most transplant centers require patients to have 6 months of abstinence and appropriate addiction treatment before they can undergo liver transplantation. Patients with active alcoholic hepatitis are not candidates for liver transplantation because of their lack of demonstrated abstinence and high perioperative mortality. Interestingly, the decision-making process regarding transplantation for most alcoholic patients with end-stage liver disease is not done at the transplant center but is determined by their primary referring physician because most patients with alcoholic cirrhosis are not referred for transplantation.\n\n【247】<sup><a>32</a></sup>\n\n【248】*   Hoofnagle JH\n*   Kresina T\n*   Fuller RK\n*   et al.\n\n【249】Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease: executive statement and recommendations: summary of a National Institutes of Health workshop held December 6–7, 1996, Bethesda, Maryland.\n\n【250】_Liver Transpl Surg._ 1997; 3 : 347-350\n\n【251】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (56)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【252】### Corticosteroids\n\n【253】Alcoholic hepatitis is an inflammatory form of liver injury. Additionally, the high incidence of autoimmune markers in patients with alcoholic hepatitis suggests an autoimmune component to the pathogenesis of injury.

Clearly, most patients with alcoholic hepatitis are _not_ candidates for corticosteroids, including those with a DF lower than 32 and no hepatic encephalopathy, as well as those with GI bleeding, renal failure, or infection. However, corticosteroids should be considered in patients with a DF greater than 32 and/or spontaneous hepatic encephalopathy in the absence of infection, GI bleeding, and renal failure based on the positive results of some of the aforementioned studies. Nonetheless, the survival benefit in this select population is modest, about 25% to 33%, with a mortality rate of almost 50%.

Sievenpiper et al note favorable effects on hemoglobin A <sub>1c </sub> and blood pressure in trials substituting fructose for other carbohydrates, explaining that the majority of trials were not funded exclusively by industry but by a combination of industry and agency. This fact should not be at all reassuring because trials that involve industry collaboration in design, analysis, or reporting use less rigorous methods and are more likely to report proindustry conclusions.\n\n【57】<sup><a>10</a></sup>\n\n【58】*   Ross J.S.\n\n【59】It's not just about the money, money, money….\n\n【60】_JAMA Intern Med._ 2014; 174 ( \\[editor’s note\\] ) : 1696\n\n【61】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (1)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【62】A recent meta-analysis found a direct effect of higher sugar intake on systolic blood pressure when industry-funded trials were included but documented an even greater increase in blood pressure when industry-funded trials were excluded\n\n【63】<sup><a>11</a></sup>\n\n【64】*   Te Morenga L.A.\n*   Howatson A.J.\n*   Jones R.M.\n*   Mann J.\n\n【65】Dietary sugars and cardiometabolic risk: systematic review and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of the effects on blood pressure and lipids.\n\n【66】_Am J Clin Nutr._ 2014; 100 : 65-79\n\n【67】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (368)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【68】(an effect about twice as strong as what might be seen with high-sodium intake\n\n【69】<sup><a>12</a></sup>\n\n【70】*   Graudal N.A.\n*   Galløe A.M.\n*   Garred P.\n\n【71】Effects of sodium restriction on blood pressure, renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterols, and triglyceride: a meta-analysis.\n\n【72】_JAMA._ 1998; 279 : 1383-1391\n\n【73】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (419)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【74】). Another systematic review revealed a striking dichotomy: more than 80% of industry-funded studies reported _no_ relationship between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and weight gain, whereas more than 80% of non–industry-funded studies found a positive correlation between intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and weight gain.\n\n【75】<sup><a>13</a></sup>\n\n【76】*   Bes-Rastrollo M.\n*   Schulze M.B.\n*   Ruiz-Canela M.\n*   Martinez-Gonzalez M.A.\n\n【77】Financial conflicts of interest and reporting bias regarding the association between sugar-sweetened beverages and weight gain: a systematic review of systematic reviews.\n\n【78】_PLoS Med._ 2013; 10 : e1001578\n\n【79】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (218)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【80】There are also measurement issues to consider in the trials cited by Sievenpiper et al.

The setting was a multispecialty group practice in Minnesota. We reviewed a total of 400 visit notes: 100 each for patients seen in a rheumatology department (intervention group) and a pulmonary medicine department (control group) from July 1 to August 30, 2005, before online access to notes, and 100 each for patients seen in these 2 departments 1 year later, from July 1 to August 30, 2006, when only rheumatology patients had online access to visit notes. We measured changes in visit note content related to 9 hypotheses for increased patient understanding and 5 for decreased frank or judgmental language.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】Changes occurred for 2 of the 9 hypotheses related to patient understanding, both in an unpredicted direction. The proportion of acronyms or abbreviations increased more in the notes of rheumatologists than of pulmonologists (0.6% vs 0.1%; _P_ \\=.01), whereas the proportion of _anatomy understood_ decreased more in the notes of rheumatologists than of pulmonologists (−5.9% vs −0.8%; _P_ \\=.02). One change (of 5 possible) occurred related to the use of frank or judgmental terms.

His medical history was remarkable for a 2-year history of leukopenia, with an absolute neutrophil count of less than 1.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L while taking hydroxychloroquine for treatment of inflammatory polyarthritis.\n\n【41】Three weeks after the onset of pain, an outpatient evaluation by his primary care physician identified tenderness overlying the left trochanteric bursa. Left trochanteric bursitis was diagnosed, and the bursa was injected with methylprednisolone (80 mg) and 0.25% bupivacaine (2 mL). The patient reported minimal pain relief, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left hip 3 days later revealed no evidence of fracture or dislocation.\n\n【42】Five days after the initial evaluation, the patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment of intractable left hip and back pain. The total leukocyte count on admission was 1.8 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (reference range, 3.5-10.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), and the absolute neutrophil count was 0.79 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (reference range, 1.7-7.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). Hydroxychloroquine therapy was discontinued. A pain medicine consultation was obtained, and subsequent lumbar spine MRI revealed L2-3 disk extrusion with neural foraminal encroachment. Opioid analgesia was initiated, and the patient was dismissed from the hospital and scheduled for an outpatient epidural corticosteroid injection.\n\n【43】Three days after hospital dismissal, the patient was readmitted because of persistent left hip and back pain. Physical examination revealed reduced tactile sensation on the lateral aspect of the left thigh. Results of repeated lumbar spine MRI were unchanged, and electromyographic findings were consistent with an acute left L2 radiculopathy. The pain medicine service was reconsulted, and the diagnosis of an acute left L2 radiculopathy was established on the basis of the clinical presentation, distribution of pain, and physical examination, MRI, and electromyographic findings. After obtaining informed consent, an epidural corticosteroid injection was administered at bedside under aseptic precautions (povidone-iodine skin preparation that was allowed to air dry, application of a sterile skin drape, and use of sterile gloves and face masks by all personnel). With use of a midline approach, an 18-gauge Tuohy needle was inserted into the L2-3 interspace. The procedure was complicated by an accidental dural puncture. The stylette was reinserted and the needle removed. The epidural needle was placed successfully in the L3-4 interspace with use of an interlaminar approach, and triamcinolone (80 mg in 2 mL of preservative-free normal saline) was injected. The stylette was reinserted and the needle removed. The patient reported near-complete resolution of back pain at 1-day follow-up, and no symptoms of a persistent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak were reported. Two days after the epidural corticosteroid injection, the patient was diagnosed as having an incarcerated left inguinal hernia, which was surgically repaired under general anesthesia without complication. Intravenous cefazolin (1 g) was administered preoperatively and again 6 hours postoperatively. The patient was subsequently dismissed from the hospital and scheduled for a repeated lumbar epidural corticosteroid injection in 2 weeks.\n\n【44】On follow-up in the outpatient pain medicine clinic, the patient reported that the severity of left hip and back pain had improved 25% in comparison to his previous continual, intractable pain. Physical examination revealed mild tenderness over the lumbar spine and reduced tactile sensation on the lateral aspect of the left thigh. Because the patient had partial improvement from the initial procedure, a repeated injection was recommended. After obtaining informed consent, a midline lumbar epidural corticosteroid injection was administered under aseptic precautions at the L2-3 interspace with fluoroscopic guidance. A 20-gauge Tuohy needle was placed successfully, and triamcinolone (80 mg in 3 mL of 1% lidocaine and 1 mL of preservativefree normal saline) was injected. The stylette was reinserted and the needle removed. On telephone follow-up 1 week later, the patient reported moderate improvement of left hip and back pain.\n\n【45】Three weeks after the second epidural corticosteroid injection, the patient was admitted to the hospital because of frontotemporal headache, cervical neck pain, photophobia, and phonophobia. The symptoms had developed after discontinuation of all opioid analgesics. (Transcutaneous fentanyl, 25 µg/h, had been discontinued 8 days after the second lumbar epidural injection, and oxycodone, 15 mg orally as needed every 4 hours, had been discontinued 9 days after the second epidural injection. The opioid medications had been discontinued 15 to 16 days before hospital admission.) The patient was diagnosed as having opioid withdrawal and was dismissed from the hospital on a regimen of oxycodone tapering. Four days later, he was readmitted to the hospital with persistent headache, cervical neck pain, and photophobia and new-onset delirium. He was afebrile, the total leukocyte count was 2.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L, and the absolute neutrophil count was 2.25 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L. Lumbar spine MRI revealed a peripherally enhancing 3 × 2 × 3-cm collection of pus in the right posterior paraspinal musculature at the L2-3 level with ventral extension through the right L2-3 neural foramen ( Figure 1 ). A 0.8 × 0.4-cm posterior epidural abscess was identified at the L2-3 level. With fluoroscopic guidance, a diagnostic lumbar puncture was performed at the left L2-3 interspace. The CSF obtained had a total protein level of 146 mg/dL (reference range, 14-45 mg/dL). The CSF glucose level was less than 20 mg/dL, and the concomitant serum glucose level was 113 mg/dL. Cerebrospinal fluid cultures grew oxacillinsensitive _Staphylococcus aureus_ , but blood culture results were negative. Decompressive spinal surgery was not required, and a 3-month course of intravenous antibiotics was initiated.\n\n【46】Figure 1 Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine shows a right paraspinal (arrows) and epidural (arrowhead) abscess at L2-3.\n\n【47】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【48】Throughout the hospital course, the patient experienced persistent low back pain and developed urinary retention. He was dismissed to a skilled nursing facility, where he resided for 2 weeks. At 5-month follow-up, the patient had regained complete bladder function, and the only residual symptom was mild back discomfort with prolonged periods of sitting.\n\n【49】DISCUSSION\n----------\n\n【50】We reviewed the literature to identify predisposing epidemiological and clinical features of patients in whom epidural abscesses or meningitis developed after epidural corticosteroid injections. Our goal was to compare and contrast the findings in the reported cases with the clinical course of our patient. A MEDLINE and EMBASE literature search identified 11 reports of epidural abscess and 2 reports of epidural abscess and meningitis.

This patient subsequently developed a dural puncture headache that was treated with an epidural blood patch, and symptoms of meningitis occurred 7 days later.

A possible predisposing factor for development of meningitis in our patient was the accidental dural puncture, which occurred during performance of the first epidural injection.

Conversely, our patient did not require surgery. The bulk of the abscess was located in the paraspinal musculature, which may have attenuated compression of the thecal sac and limited the degree of neurologic damage.\n\n【136】In patients who have received epidural corticosteroid injections, the potential complications of this invasive procedure should remain paramount in the differential diagnosis of recalcitrant back pain or the onset of new neurologic symptoms. Specifically, our patient should have been evaluated fully for meningitis before he was diagnosed as having opioid withdrawal. Immunocompromised patients should be identified before treatment, and the procedure should be performed under aseptic precautions. In this subgroup of patients, the small but potentially devastating risk of an infectious complication should be weighed carefully against the potential benefits of the procedure. The epidemiological and clinical data abstracted from the small group of disparate patients identified in the literature should be interpreted with caution. However, antibiotic prophylaxis for _S aureus_ should be considered when immunocompromised patients are treated with epidural corticosteroid injections.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "mayo_clinic_proceeding", "batch_name": "20231101", "version": "version0"}

She was afebrile (35.9°C), and examination revealed moderate epigastric tenderness and hypoactive bowel sounds. No guarding or rebound tenderness was present. Findings on cardiac and pulmonary examinations were unremarkable. She was neurologically intact and clinically euvolemic. Comprehensive metabolic panel results, complete blood cell count, and amylase and lipase levels were normal except for mild leukocytosis. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan showed dilated and thickened loops of small bowel and ascites ( Figure 1 ). The C1 inhibitor level, determined after the initial blood tests, was normal as well.\n\n【17】Figure 1 Case1. Abdominal computed tomographic scand emonstrating marked small bowel edema.\n\n【18】*   View Large Image\n*   Figure Viewer\n*   Download (PPT)\n\n【19】The patient had a history of chronic hypertension and on questioning reported previous episodes of tongue swelling during a 3-year period of therapy with fosinopril. After a 6-month hiatus, she had resumed fosinopril treatment 3 days prior to this presentation. The patient had also experienced similar episodes of abdominal pain 3 years earlier while taking fosinopril. Work-up at the time included abdominal ultrasonography that showed gallstones but no evidence of ductal dilatation. Cholecystectomy was performed, and pathologic analysis revealed stones with only mild chronic cholecystitis. An intraoperative cholangiogram was normal, and the patient continued to have similar episodes in the months following surgery. Her only other current medications were aspirin because of known right carotid stenosis with 1 previous transient ischemic attack and oral estrogen because she had undergone hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy 30 years previously.\n\n【20】The patient was admitted to the hospital for observation. She was given intravenous prochlorperazine for nausea and placed on maintenance saline infusion. The fosinopril was discontinued. The known right carotid artery stenosis raised concern for occult intestinal ischemia, and mesenteric angiography was performed. Findings were normal, and without any other measures, the patient's symptoms completely resolved by the following morning. A barium x-ray study of the small bowel was performed at this time, and findings were normal ( Figure 2 ). The patient was discharged and has had no further episodes of abdominal pain in the subsequent 36 months since discontinuing fosinopril.\n\n【21】Figure 2 Case 1.

She denied fever, chills, hematochezia, and melena, and there were no genitourinary complaints. Her last menstrual period had been 1 week earlier. The patient had undergone cholecystectomy 1 month before this presentation after experiencing similar abdominal pain. No gallbladder wall thickening, ductal dilatation, or pericholecystic fluid was noted intraoperatively, and findings on limited bowel inspection were unremarkable. Her only medication was lisinopril (20 mg/d for the past 2 years), and her history, other than essential hypertension, was noncontributory. There was no family history of angioedema or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【25】Examination findings at this presentation included tachycardia (128 beats/min) and an obese, distended abdomen that was tender to deep palpation in both lower quadrants. Comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood cell count revealed mild leukocytosis with left shift; serum lactate and amylase levels were normal. An abdominal CT scan revealed marked thickening of the small bowel extending to the distal ileum, as well as a small amount of ascites around the liver and in the pelvis ( Figure 3 ).\n\n【26】Figure 3 Case 2.

The area of inflammation began 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve and extended (proximally) some 160 cm. Mesentery had normal pulsation, and as the bowel appeared viable throughout, no resection was performed. Diagnosis of ACE inhibitor-induced visceral angioedema was entertained, and lisinopril was not resumed postoperatively. Stool cultures obtained on admission were negative, and the patient was ultimately discharged. Thus far, she has had no recurrence of her symptoms, with more than 1 year of follow-up.\n\n【29】Figure 4 Case 2. Intraoperative photograph of edematous, inflamed small intestine.

There is no known sex predilection for reported cases of peripheral ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema or for hereditary angioedema. In case 1, the first report to involve fosinopril, the patient's history of tongue swelling while taking the drug, the onset of her current presentation within 3 days of resuming it, and the rapid reversal of signs and symptoms on withdrawal of the medication strongly implicates small bowel angioedema from fosinopril exposure as the cause of her episode. The similar improvement experienced by the patient in case 2—without specific therapy other than cessation of lisinopril—also supports our diagnosis. Both patients had undergone prior surgical procedures for symptoms that subsequently failed to resolve until withdrawal of their ACE inhibitors. Clinically, these cases present with acute abdominal symptoms, and a correct diagnosis depends on a high index of suspicion in patients taking ACE inhibitors.\n\n【81】Table 1 Previously Reported Cases of Visceral Angioedema Related to Angiotensin-Con verting Enzyme Inhibitor Exposure\n\n| Source | Age (yj/sex | Medication | Duration of use prior to onset of symptoms | Presentation |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Abdelmalek & Doug\\] as,3Abdelmalek MEDouglas DDLisinopril-induced isolated visceral angioedema: review of ACE-inhibitor-induccd small bowel angio-edema._Dig Dis Sci._ 1997; 42 : 847-850CrossrefPubMedScopus (32)Google Scholar1997 | 41/F | Lisinopril | 2 d | Pain, ascites, small bowel edema |\n| Farraye et al,4Farraye FAPeppercorn MASteer MLJoffe NRees MAcute small-bowel mucosal edema following enalapril use \\[letter\\]._JAMA._ 1988; 259 : 3131CrossrefPubMedScopus (23)Google Scholar1988 | 41/F | Enalapril | 1 d | Pain, small bowel edema |\n| Matsumura et al,5Matsumura MHaruki KKajinami KTakada TAngioedema likely related to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors._Intern Med._ 1993; 32 : 424-426CrossrefPubMedScopus (33)Google Scholar1993 | 48/F | Captopril | 2 d | Pain, ascites |\n| Jacobs etal,6Jacobs RLHobermun LJGoldstein HMAngioedema of die small bowel caused by an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor._Am J Gastroenterol._ 1994; 89 : 127-128PubMedGoogle Scholar1994 | 51/F | Enalapril | 9 wk | Pain, ascites, small bowel edema |\n| Gregory & Davis,7Gregory KWDavis RCImages in clinical medicine: angiocdema of the intestine._N Engl J Med._ 1996; 334 : 1641CrossrefPubMedScopus (40)Google Scholar1996 | 58/F | Lisinopril | Unspecified | Pain, cmesis, small bowel edema |\n| Dupasquier,8Dupasquier EA rare clinical form of angioneurotic edema caused by enalapril: acute abdomen (in French\\]._Arch Mal Coeur Vaiss._ 1994; 87 : 1371-1374PubMedGoogle Scholar1994 | 43/F | Enalapril | 1 d | Pain, emesis, diarrhea |\n| Mullinsetal,9Mullins RJShanahan TMDobson RTVisceral angioedema related to treatment with an ACE inhibitor._Med J Aust._ 1996; 165 : 319-321PubMedGoogle Scholar1996 | 59/F | Enalapril | 2 d | Pain, emesis, diarrhea |\n| Guy eta\\],10Guy CCathebras PRousset HSuspected angioedema of abdominal viscera \\[letter\\]._Ann Iniern Med._ 1994; 121 : 900CrossrefPubMedScopus (14)Google Scholar1994 | 29/F | Lisinopril | 16 wk | Pain, ascites |\n\n【83】*   Open table in a new tab\n\n【84】Angioneurotic edema may be caused by certain drugs as well as by hereditary or acquired Cl inhibitor deficiency.

Severe toxic reactions to 5-FU have been associated with decreased levels of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) enzyme activity. Manifestations of 5-FU toxicity typically include cytopenia, diarrhea, stomatitis, mucositis, neurotoxicity, and, in extreme cases, death. A variety of genetic variations in _DPYD_ , the gene encoding DPD, are known to result in decreased DPD enzyme activity and to contribute to 5-FU toxic effects. Recently, it was reported that healthy African American individuals carrying the Y186C _DPYD_ variant (rs115232898) had significantly reduced DPD enzyme activity compared with noncarriers of Y186C. Herein, we describe for the first time, to our knowledge, an African American patient with cancer with the Y186C variant who had severe toxic effects after administration of the standard dose of 5-FU chemotherapy. The patient lacked any additional toxic effect–associated variations in the _DPYD_ gene or the thymidylate synthase ( _TYMS_ ) promoter.

Her medical history included hypertension, asthma, fibromyalgia, and bipolar disorder. The patient underwent colonoscopy, with biopsy of a suspicious mass revealing adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Immunohistochemical stains of the tumor were CK20 and CDX2 positive and CK7 negative, consistent with colonic origin. Positron emission tomography for staging revealed the following: metastatic tumor above and below the diaphragm, abnormal fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the left supraclavicular region and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, innumerable liver lesions, diffuse retroperitoneal and portacaval lymphadenopathy, and an abnormally thickened sigmoid colon. With these findings, the patient was staged as having metastatic colon cancer (stage IV). The patient’s performance status was zero, and she was started on systemic therapy with FOLFOX (5-FU, 400 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> intravenous push; 5-FU, 2400 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> intravenous infusion over 46 hours; leucovorin, 400 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ; and oxaliplatin, 85 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> ), with the plan to add bevacizumab once the poorly controlled hypertension was resolved. Approximately 10 days after administration of the first cycle of FOLFOX, the patient presented with severe mucositis, esophagitis, inadequate pain control, and dehydration necessitating hospitalization.\n\n【115】On admission to the hospital, the patient was pancytopenic, with a white blood cell count of 2.4 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (reference range, 4.0-11.0 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), an absolute neutrophil count of 1.2 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (reference range, 1.5-7.5 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L), a hemoglobin level of 10.8 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10) (reference range, 13.5-16.0 g/dL), and a platelet count of 80 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L (reference range, 150-400 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L). A comprehensive metabolic profile was normal other than an elevated blood urea nitrogen level of 34 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.357) (reference range, 6-24 mg/dL), a potassium level of 3.1 mmol/L (reference range, 3.6-5.1 mmol/L), an albumin level of 3.3 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10) (reference range, 3.4-4.8 g/dL), a phosphorus level of 2.5 mg/dL (to convert to mmol/L, multiply by 0.323) (reference range, 2.7-4.5 mg/dL), an alkaline phosphatase level of 146 U/L (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167) (reference range, 40-130 U/L), and a lactate dehydrogenase level of 288 U/L (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167) (reference range, 50-175 U/L). A coagulation panel revealed a prothrombin time of 14.0 seconds (reference range, 9.7-13.6 seconds) and an international normalized ratio (INR) of 1.3 (reference range, 0.9-1.1).\n\n【116】The patient’s hospital course was complicated by persistent pancytopenia, with a nadir white blood cell count of 0.7 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L and an absolute neutrophil count of 0, unresponsive to growth colony–stimulating factors, that spontaneously recovered 20 days after chemotherapy ( Figure ). The patient had development of _Clostridium difficile_ while hospitalized that led to sigmoid colon perforation with peritonitis. The patient and her family refused surgery, and she was administered intravenous ertapenem, fluconazole, and oral vancomycin as conservative management, as well as total parental nutrition. The patient also had development of isolated factor VII deficiency of unknown etiology. The INR peaked at 3.1. Mixing study results were consistent with isolated functional factor VII deficiency. Factors II, V, and X were within normal limits. A repeated mixing study 3 days later found the same distribution of factor functionality. The INR improved to 1.6 with vitamin K administration. The patient also had delirium of unknown etiology but was responsive to risperidone, 0.25 mg orally twice daily. The patient’s condition continued to worsen, and the decision was made to pursue in-home hospice care. The patient was discharged after her nearly 4-week hospital stay, and she died at home the following week. No autopsy was performed.\n\n【117】Figure Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of an African American patient who experienced 5-fluorouracil toxic effects after the administration of FOLFOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin).

To date, this is the first report, to our knowledge, identifying the Y186C variant in an African American patient with 5-FU toxic effects.\n\n【157】Comprehensive genetic analysis of the _DPYD_ gene revealed no unknown amino acid–changing DPYD variants and none of the variants commonly associated with 5-FU–related toxic effects ( _DPYD\\*2A_ , D949V, and I560S). Furthermore, genotyping found no other abnormalities for variants in other catabolic and anabolic 5-FU genes ( _DPYS_ , _TK1_ , _TYMP_ , and _MTHFR_ ) that have previously been implicated in other 5-FU toxic effect association studies. Although we identified a nonsynonymous variant in the _UMPS_ gene (rs1801019; G213A) and a noncoding 5′ upstream variant (rs3763506; chr7:48128850 T>C) in the _UPP1_ gene, there is no reported evidence linking the 2 variants with 5-FU–related toxic effects. This analysis of _TYMS_ variants identified the patient as homozygous for the 3RGGC repeat and heterozygous for the _TYMS_ 3′UTR 6-bp deletion (c.1531-1536 AAGTTA/DEL), signifying a moderate to high thymidylate synthase–expression genotype (reviewed by Gusella and Padrini\n\n【158】<sup><a>20</a></sup>\n\n【159】*   Gusella M.\n*   Padrini R.\n\n【160】G>C SNP of thymidylate synthase with respect to colorectal cancer.\n\n【161】_Pharmacogenomics._ 2007; 8 : 985-996\n\n【162】*   Crossref\n*   PubMed\n*   Scopus (29)\n*   Google Scholar\n\n【163】).

Although genetic analysis revealed no _DPYD_ variants known to be associated with 5-FU toxic effects, the patient was heterozygous for the African-specific Y186C variant of _DPYD,_ which has previously been found to be associated with decreased DPD activity. This case study is the first report, to our knowledge, to identify the Y186C variant in a patient with severe toxic effects after a standard dose of a 5-FU–based therapeutic regimen, suggesting that the variant has utility as a predictive genetic marker for 5-FU–related toxic effects.\n\n【215】Acknowledgments\n---------------\n\n【216】We thank the Mayo Clinic Medical Genome Facility for sequencing services.

Daily GMA was expressed as the planetary K-index and the integrated A-index and was graded as levels I (quiet), II (unsettled), III (active), and IV (storm).\n\n【5】### Results\n\n【6】A daily mean ± SD of 59,468±11,397 patients were monitored between January 1, 2009, and May 15, 2012. The distribution of days according to GMA was as follows: level I, 924/1231 (75%); level II, 226/1231 (18%); level III, 60/1231 (5%); and level IV, 21/1231 (2%). The daily mean ± SD numbers of ICD shocks received per 1000 active patients in the database were 1.29±0.47, 1.17±0.46, 1.03±0.37, and 0.94±0.29 on level I, II, III, and IV days, respectively; the daily mean ± SD sums of shocks and antitachycardia pacing therapies were 9.29±2.86, 8.46±2.45, 7.92±1.80, and 7.83±2.28 on quiet, unsettled, active, and storm days, respectively. A significant inverse relationship between GMA and frequency of ICD therapies was identified, with the most pronounced difference between level I and level IV days ( _P_ <.001 for shocks; _P_ \\=.008 for shocks + antitachycardia pacing).\n\n【7】### Conclusion\n\n【8】In a large-scale cohort analysis, ICD therapies were delivered less frequently on days of higher GMA, confirming the previous pilot data and suggesting that higher GMA does not pose an increased risk of arrhythmias using ICD therapies as a surrogate marker. Further studies are needed to gain an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms.\n\n【9】#### Abbreviations and Acronyms:\n\n【10】ATP ( antitachycardia pacing ), CRT-D ( cardiac resynchronization therapy–defibrillator ), GMA ( geomagnetic activity ), ICD ( implantable cardioverter defibrillator )\n\n【11】To read this article in full you will need to make a payment\n\n【12】### Purchase one-time access:\n\n【13】Academic & Personal: 24 hour online access Corporate R&D Professionals: 24 hour online access\n\n【14】One-time access price info\n\n【15】*   For academic or personal research use, select 'Academic and Personal'\n*   For corporate R&D use, select 'Corporate R&D Professionals'\n\n【16】### Subscribe:\n\n【17】Subscribe to _Mayo Clinic Proceedings_\n\n【18】Already a print subscriber?

We studied preoperative comorbidity, intraoperative hypotension, and postoperative data in patients with postoperative stupor or coma and compared the characteristics with control patients (surgical intensive care unit patients with neurologic consultations for other reasons).\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】A total of 35 patients with stupor or coma after surgery and 31 control patients participated in this study. Comatose patients were older ( _P_ \\=.004) and had significantly more presurgical comorbidity ( _P_ <.001), cardiovascular surgical procedures ( _P_ <.001), and intraoperative hypotension ( _P_ \\=.03). Adjusted for age and comorbidity, intraoperative hypotension remained statistically significant but not after adjusting for cardiovascular surgery. Of the 34 computed tomograms obtained, 41% showed abnormal results; of the 12 magnetic resonance images obtained, 58% showed abnormal results. Both showed primarily infarctions. In 4 patients with normal computed tomographic results, magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple territorial infarctions.\n\n【6】### CONCLUSION\n\n【7】Prior comorbidity, older age, intraoperative hypotension, and cardiovascular surgery may predispose patients to postoperative coma.
