VSDs occur in isolation or in combination with other congenital heart disease defects, as in an atrioventricular canal, tetralogy of Fallot, and, occasionally, D-transposition of the great arteries. (See  \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects\" and  \"Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF): Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis\" and  \"D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA): Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\".)\n【2】 The management of infants and children with isolated VSDs will be discussed here. The anatomy, pathophysiology, natural history, clinical features, and evaluation of isolated VSDs are discussed separately. (See  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\" and  \"Echocardiographic evaluation of ventricular septal defects\".)\n【3】 The management of other complex congenital heart lesions that include VSD is discussed separately:\n【4】 ●AV canal defects (see  \"Management and outcome of atrioventricular (AV) canal defects\")\n【5】 ●TOF (see  \"Management and outcome of tetralogy of Fallot\")\n【6】 ●D-TGA (see  \"D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA): Management and outcome\")\n【7】 OVERVIEW — The management approach for VSD is dependent on the presence and severity of symptoms, the likelihood of spontaneous closure, and the risk of long-term complications that could be prevented by early intervention. These factors are primarily dictated by the size of the defect and magnitude of left-to-right shunting (algorithm 1). The clinical examination and echocardiography (which also confirms the diagnosis) provides information on the size of the defect and degree of shunting. (See  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical features' and  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Diagnosis'.)\n【8】 Management options include:\n【9】 ●No intervention – For patients with small defects, intervention is usually not required. These patients are typically asymptomatic and have a reasonable expectation of spontaneous closure or decrease in the size of the defect over time. (See  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Small ventricular septal defect'.)\n【10】 ●Medical therapy – Medical therapy is required for patients with symptoms of heart failure. For patients with moderate defects, medical management may adequately address the needs of the patients. For those with more severe symptoms, surgical correction is usually necessary and medical management is aimed at reducing symptoms in the interim. (See 'Medical management of heart failure' below.)\n【11】 ●Closure of the defect – For patients who are not adequately managed by medical therapy, and in those at risk for long-term significant sequelae (eg, pulmonary hypertension or valvar damage) surgical repair is generally warranted. (See 'Indications' below.)\n【12】 NEONATES — The degree of shunting during the first weeks of life varies with the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life due to changes in pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance that normally occur during this time period. As a result, ongoing monitoring in the neonatal period is important to determine which infants will remain asymptomatic and require no intervention versus those who develop heart failure and require intervention. (See  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Post-delivery'.)\n【13】 In our practice, once the diagnosis of VSD is established in the neonate, the next appointment is scheduled at three to four weeks of after birth, provided the infant is well. The visit is timed to coincide with the anticipated onset of symptoms of heart failure in at-risk patients with moderate to large VSDs. In addition, parents and primary care providers are asked to monitor the patient for signs or symptoms of failure, which should prompt an earlier visit with the pediatric cardiologist. (See 'Health care maintenance' below and  \"Heart failure in children: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)\n【14】 SMALL VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT — Patients with small VSDs are expected to remain asymptomatic and have a reasonable likelihood of spontaneous closure. (See  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Small ventricular septal defect'.)\n【15】 Our approach to managing infants with small VSDs is as follows:\n【16】 ●Patients should undergo follow-up assessment at three to four weeks of age by a pediatric cardiologist to detect any signs or symptoms of increased left ventricular volume overload. The exception is trivial muscular VSDs. If initial imaging and Doppler demonstrate a very small defect, follow-up is not generally necessary until three to six months of age, by which time many will have closed.\n【17】 ●For those patients who remain asymptomatic, a follow-up evaluation is scheduled with the cardiologist at around six months of age.\n【18】 ●Between visits with the cardiologist, routine care is provided by the primary care provider. If the patient becomes symptomatic (eg, poor weight gain, tachypnea), the patient should be promptly referred to the specialist for cardiac evaluation. (See 'Health care maintenance' below and 'Symptomatic patients' below.)\n【19】 ●If at the six-month visit the murmur is gone, repeat echocardiogram is not necessary, unless clinical concerns arise (eg, endocarditis).\n【20】 ●Patients who continue to have a murmur, but are otherwise asymptomatic and growing well at the six-month visit, are seen again by the pediatric cardiologist at approximately 12 months of age.\n【21】 ●If at the 12-month visit with the cardiologist the murmur is gone, repeat echocardiogram is not necessary, unless clinical concerns arise (eg, endocarditis). If there is no evidence of a defect, no additional follow-up is necessary [1]. (See  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Complications'.)\n【22】 ●If the murmur persists at the 12-month cardiology visit and the patient remains asymptomatic and clinically stable, no further intervention is required. Echocardiographic follow-up is typically performed at three years of age for patients with membranous defects. In those with a muscular defect, no echocardiography is required if the patient remains asymptomatic.\n【23】 ●Asymptomatic patients with residual small defects are usually followed every two to five years for overall assessment. Potential complications of residual small defects are rare and may include infective endocarditis, aortic regurgitation, right or left ventricle outflow tract obstruction and shunting from the left ventricle to right atrium. These complications are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Complications'.)\n【24】 ●Medical therapy is initiated in any symptomatic patient. However, since heart failure is not expected in association with small VSDs, the development of new symptoms, particularly late, should prompt reassessment of the original diagnosis and evaluation for other causes of the symptoms. (See 'Symptomatic patients' below.)\n【25】 MODERATE TO LARGE VENTRICULAR SEPTAL DEFECT — Infants with moderate to large VSDs usually become symptomatic within the first months of life as pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) declines. The primary care provider should monitor the infant during the first weeks of life for manifestations of heart failure (eg, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, poor weight gain or failure to thrive, and diaphoresis particularly with feeding). (See 'Health care maintenance' below and  \"Heart failure in children: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)\n【26】 If an assessment has not been done earlier, the infant is evaluated at three to four weeks of age by a pediatric cardiologist because of the expected decrease in PVR resulting in increased left ventricular (LV) flow. At that visit, the infant is assessed for early signs of heart failure. If symptoms develop, medical therapy is warranted as detailed in the following sections. Infants who remain asymptomatic should have ongoing follow-up and monitoring. (See 'Symptomatic patients' below and 'Asymptomatic patients' below.)\n【27】 Asymptomatic patients — Regular follow-up should occur throughout the first year of life for all infants with moderate to large VSDs, even if symptoms are lacking. It is important to assess these patients for evidence of pulmonary hypertension. If the murmur is gone but the pulmonic component of second heart sound (S2) is increased in intensity (movie 1), an echocardiogram is obtained to estimate pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). For patients with estimated PAP <50 percent of systemic arterial pressure, the risk of developing pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease (PHVD) is low [1]. Patients with PAP ≥50 percent of systemic arterial pressure are at risk of developing PHVD and they should be referred for surgical closure by six months of age and no later than one year of age. (See 'Management of patients with pulmonary hypertension' below and 'Closure interventions' below.)\n【28】 Controversy exists regarding the optimal management of asymptomatic patients (no heart failure or failure to thrive) without pulmonary hypertension (ie, PAP <50 percent of systemic arterial pressure), but who have a persistent large left-to-right shunt (ie, ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow [Qp:Qs] >2:1) with corresponding LV dilation. Although many centers advocate closure by one year of age for these patients, others allow for more time for resolution of LV dilation beyond the first year of life. In one case series of patients with pressure-restrictive VSD and moderate to severe LV dilation without heart failure or pulmonary hypertension, conservative medical management with observation (mean follow-up of 7.8 years) resulted in spontaneous resolution of LV dilation and avoidance of surgical closure in 29 of 33 patients [2]. However, until larger long-term studies are performed to evaluate this conservative approach, it remains uncertain whether complications may occur in adults with sizeable residual VSDs [3]. Surgical intervention early in life may be necessary to avoid long-term sequelae. If symptoms and/or evidence of pulmonary hypertension develop, the patient should be referred for closure. Otherwise, the decision to close the defect is based largely upon the degree of LV dilation and provider and patient preferences. In most instances, the decision can be made by the end of the first year. (See 'Closure interventions' below.)\n【29】 For patients who remain asymptomatic after the first year of life without evidence of pulmonary hypertension or LV dilation, follow-up visits are scheduled every one to two years with an echocardiographic evaluation approximately every two years in stable patients. In addition, echocardiography is performed in children >2 years old whose defects have not closed if outflow tract obstruction or aortic regurgitation is suspected [4]. (See  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Complications'.)\n【30】 Symptomatic patients — For symptomatic patients, medical intervention may postpone and possibly avoid the need for surgical correction. The goals of therapy are to alleviate heart failure symptoms and normalize growth. Management of symptomatic patients includes nutritional support and pharmacologic treatment of heart failure (eg, diuretic therapy). Measures to prevent respiratory tract infections are also an important component of management (eg, influenza immunization and respiratory syncytial virus immunoprophylaxis if eligible). (See 'Health care maintenance' below and  \"Heart failure in children: Management\".)\n【31】 Nutritional support — Nutritional support may facilitate weight gain in infants with moderate to large VSDs. These infants have increased caloric needs due to an increased metabolic demand and may need a caloric intake that is >150 kcal/kg per day [1]. Infants with heart failure often tire with feeding and their intake may be limited. Increasing the caloric density of feeds can provide the necessary caloric intake in a smaller total daily volume, which the patient is more likely to be able to consume each day. The caloric density is increased by the addition of carbohydrate and/or medium-chain triglyceride preparations to conventional formulas [4]. (See  \"Poor weight gain in children younger than two years in resource-abundant settings: Management\", section on 'Nutritional therapy'.)\n【32】 One strategy to increase daily caloric intake is to provide more frequent feedings; however, parents may find this challenging. These infants usually take a long period of time to eat and the amount of time required to ensure adequate intake can be substantial. The use of nasogastric feedings may be necessary to improve caloric intake. This may include bolus or continuous feeds, which can be given at night or during the day. The use of these measures usually indicates that closure of the VSD will be required [5].\n【33】 Fluid restriction is generally not helpful in the management of infants with heart failure related to VSDs because it tends to result in inadequate caloric intake. Although fluid restriction is often used in the management of adults and older children with heart failure, it is counterproductive in infants because they are totally dependent on a liquid diet. Diuretic therapy rather than fluid restriction should be used to reduce and prevent volume overload as discussed in the following section.\n【34】 Infants with iron deficiency anemia should be treated with supplemental iron to increase the hematocrit and oxygen-carrying capacity. (See  \"Iron deficiency in infants and children <12 years: Treatment\".)\n【35】 Medical management of heart failure — The medical management varies depending on the severity of heart failure symptoms. Diuretics are the mainstay of therapy. Though angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been used in the past, their effectiveness appears to be minimal and they are no longer routinely used. In severe cases, intravenous (IV) inotropic agents may be used (eg, milrinone, dopamine) as a temporizing measure. We typically do not prescribe oral digoxin given the potential for adverse effects with this drug and because it is debatable whether it is beneficial in patients with ventricular volume overload and normal underlying ventricular function [6-8]. (See  \"Heart failure in children: Management\".)\n【36】 In our practice, decisions regarding medical therapy are based on growth and the degree of heart failure:\n【37】 ●Mild congestive failure (mild tachypnea or diaphoresis while feeding and adequate growth) – Initial diuretic therapy with furosemide (1 mg/kg per dose given orally two to three times a day) is usually sufficient for these patients. Surgery is considered by the end of the first year of life for patients in whom the need for medication persists because the defect has not adequately narrowed or resolved. (See 'Closure interventions' below.)\n【38】 ●Moderate heart failure (tachypnea or diaphoresis with feeding and signs of growth failure) – More aggressive diuretic therapy is typically prescribed in this setting, using higher doses of furosemide (2 mg/kg per dose given orally two to three times per day) and the possible addition of spironolactone for potassium sparring effects (1 mg/kg/dose given one to two times per day). Daily caloric intake is maximized to 150 kcal/kg. After achieving maximal therapeutic targets, patients who show no or little improvement in symptoms are referred for surgical correction. (See 'Closure interventions' below.)\n【39】 ●Severe heart failure (respiratory distress [tachypnea, grunting, retractions or diaphoresis] at rest and failure to thrive) – Patients with severe heart failure typically require early surgical repair (often by three months of age). Initial medical supportive measures should be initiated prior to surgical intervention to stabilize the infant's condition. In most cases, patients with severe heart failure require inpatient management. Interventions may include:\n【40】 In some cases (eg, if heart failure symptoms were triggered by an acute respiratory tract infection from which the infant subsequently recovers), patients may improve considerably with medical management and surgery can be deferred. However, most infants with moderate to large VSDs who develop severe heart failure do not to respond adequately to medical therapy and are referred for early surgical closure. (See 'Closure interventions' below.)\n【41】 Follow-up — For patients who respond to medical therapy (including satisfactory growth), regular follow-up should occur throughout the first year of life. The frequency of follow-up visits is dictated by the severity of symptoms. Patients are monitored for dose adjustment of the medical regimen and to detect any evidence of pulmonary hypertension that may indicate a need for surgical repair. (See 'Management of patients with pulmonary hypertension' below.)\n【42】 For patients who have resolution of heart failure symptoms (including normal growth) and are successfully weaned off of heart failure therapies, ongoing monitoring is performed as previously described. (See 'Asymptomatic patients' above.)\n【43】 For infants who continue to require medical therapy, the timing and need for surgical closure is determined by symptoms of heart failure and the estimated PAP. Symptomatic infants with normal PAP, but with a large left-to-right shunt, should have surgery by one year of age. If PAP is elevated (ie, >50 percent of systemic arterial pressure), surgical repair is performed in the first six months of life. Earlier repair may be warranted in infants with Down syndrome because they have an increased risk of developing irreversible pulmonary hypertension. (See 'Closure interventions' below.)\n【44】 Management of patients with pulmonary hypertension — Infants with large VSDs are at risk for PHVD, which can develop as early as six months of age. Patients with Down syndrome, those with a large degree of left-to-right shunting, and those with elevated PAP have the greatest risk of developing PHVD. By contrast, the risk of PHVD is low in patients with normal PAP.\n【45】 Evaluation for pulmonary hypertension includes clinical examination (eg, quality of the murmur and intensity of S2 (movie 1)) and echocardiography (eg, regurgitant tricuspid jet flow, septal position, or right-to-left shunting). Though rarely necessary, patients who have echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension may require further assessment with cardiac catheterization. (See  \"Pulmonary hypertension in children: Classification, evaluation, and diagnosis\", section on 'Echocardiography' and  \"Echocardiographic evaluation of ventricular septal defects\", section on 'Assessment of right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures'.)\n【46】 Cardiac catheterization is not often performed in isolated VSD; however, it may be helpful in evaluating the hemodynamic status and PVR in the following settings:\n【47】 ●Infants and children who have large defects but small left-to-right shunts.\n【48】 ●Patients who are referred for initial assessment late in the first year of life or beyond with normal or mildly increased LV size who have a large anatomical VSD (ie, diameter ≥50 percent of the size of the aortic annulus).\n【49】 Compared with echocardiography, cardiac catheterization provides a more accurate measurement of PAP, provides additional hemodynamic measurements (eg, PVR, Qp:Qs), and allows vasoreactivity testing (ie, measurement of the response to pulmonary vasodilators). Data from the cardiac catheterization (particularly the PVR measurement) may help guide management decisions. (See  \"Pulmonary hypertension in children: Classification, evaluation, and diagnosis\", section on 'Cardiac catheterization'.)\n【50】 For children with VSDs associated with echocardiographic and/or cardiac catheterization evidence of pulmonary hypertension, surgical considerations based upon the calculated PVR in Wood units (WU) or PVR index (PVRI in WU∙m2) are generally as follows:\n【51】 ●If PVRI is <8 WU∙m2, surgical closure is recommended. (See 'Indications' below.)\n【52】 ●If PVRI is >12 WU∙m2, the patient is at high risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and surgical closure of the defect is usually not recommended. Closure of defects with such elevated PVR may result in low cardiac output and increased perioperative mortality. Rarely in these circumstances, there may be consideration for placement of a restrictive VSD patch. (See 'Contraindications' below.)\n【53】 ●For PVRI in the range of 8 to 12 WU∙m2, additional information (eg, vasoreactivity testing) is helpful in guiding decisions for surgery and postoperative management.\n【54】 Patients who have PVR values >8 mmHg/L/min/m2 should be evaluated and followed at a center with expertise in treatment of patients with pulmonary hypertension. Medical therapy may be helpful for many of these patients. Management of pulmonary hypertension in pediatric patients is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  \"Pulmonary hypertension in children: Management and prognosis\".)\n【55】 CLOSURE INTERVENTIONS\n【56】 Overview — Decisions regarding closure of VSDs and the type of procedure are made on a case-by-case basis. Factors to consider include the severity of heart failure, likelihood of progression of pulmonary hypertensive vascular disease (PHVD) or other complications, likelihood of reduction in size or spontaneous closure of the defect, the morbidity and mortality of the procedure in young infants in the center where the surgery is to be performed, and the likelihood of successful surgical closure. Infants with Down syndrome are at increased risk of developing PHVD and therefore early surgical intervention may be warranted in patients with moderate to large defects.\n【57】 The goal of VSD closure is to alleviate or prevent heart failure symptoms and to intervene before irreversible PHVD develops, which may occur as early as six months in high risk patients. Patients with moderate to large VSDs who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy should generally be referred for closure intervention by the age of one year. Earlier intervention is warranted in patients with severe symptoms and those at increased risk for PHVD (eg, Down syndrome, elevated pulmonary artery pressure [PAP] on echocardiography). (See 'Indications' below.)\n【58】 Primary patch surgical closure is the preferred procedure in most cases. Transcatheter closure is generally reserved for patients with defects that are technically challenging to close operatively (eg, remote apical muscular defect, multiple muscular defects [\"Swiss cheese\" septum]) or for patients unable to undergo cardiopulmonary bypass for various reasons. Transcatheter VSD closure is technically challenging and should be performed in centers with considerable experience and expertise in interventional catheterization techniques and with surgical backup. (See 'Surgical repair' below and 'Transcatheter closure' below.)\n【59】 Indications — In our practice, VSD closure is generally recommended for patients with any of the following findings [1,4]:\n【60】 ●Persistent symptoms despite maximal medical therapy (including diuretics and nutritional support). (See 'Symptomatic patients' above.)\n【61】 ●Moderate or large defects associated with pulmonary hypertension (ie, PAP >50 percent of systemic arterial pressure). However, VSD closure should not be performed if pulmonary hypertension is severe (ie, suprasystemic PAP). (See 'Management of patients with pulmonary hypertension' above and 'Contraindications' below.)\n【62】 ●Persistent left-to-right shunt with associated left ventricular (LV) dilation (ie, ratio of pulmonary to systemic blood flow [Qp:Qs] >2:1) in the absence of symptoms. The optimal timing for intervening on these patients is not clear and generally center dependent. (See 'Asymptomatic patients' above.)\n【63】 ●Subpulmonic and membranous defects with associated aortic valve prolapse and aortic regurgitation. (See  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Aortic regurgitation'.)\n【64】 ●Double-chambered right ventricle – Infrequently, in association with membranous VSDs, right ventricular (RV) muscle bundles may hypertrophy, leading to subpulmonic obstruction. This condition is known as double-chambered right ventricle since the cavity is divided into two regions of differing pressure. Though there is no specific agreement on timing for intervention, we generally proceed to surgical resection when the higher pressure chamber exceeds one-half of systemic levels [9-14]. (See  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Right ventricular outflow obstruction'.)\n【65】 Surgery is not typically required for asymptomatic patients with residual shunts in the absence of left ventricular dilation or elevated PAP.\n【66】 Contraindications — VSD closure is generally contraindicated if PAP is suprasystemic or if pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) is >12 Wood units (WU). As previously noted, in these patients with severe pulmonary hypertension, closure of the defect may result in low cardiac output and increased perioperative mortality. In these circumstances, there may be consideration for placement of a restrictive VSD patch, but this is a rare circumstance. (See 'Management of patients with pulmonary hypertension' above.)\n【67】 PAP between 75 and 100 percent of systemic pressure and PVR between 8 and 12 WU∙m2 are not absolute contraindications to VSD closure; however this degree of pulmonary hypertension can be associated with increased risk of perioperative complications and decisions regarding closure of the defect should be made on a case-by-case basis. In these patients, closure of the defect may not result in a concomitant decrease in PVR. As a result, these patients may have persistent RV hypertension, possibly suprasystemic with development of RV failure without the presence of a pop-off from the RV to the LV. These patients require judicious postoperative ventilator and vasodilator management. (See  \"Pulmonary hypertension in children: Management and prognosis\".)\n【68】 Surgical repair — For most children who require a VSD closure intervention, direct patch closure under cardiopulmonary bypass is the procedure of choice. Surgical closure is associated with an excellent outcome with low rates of mortality and reoperation [15-19]. The approach (eg, transatrial, transaortic, right ventriculotomy, apical ventriculotomy) depends upon the type and location of the defect, as well as the preference of the surgeon [4,20]. Ventriculotomy is infrequently used in contemporary practice and should be avoided when possible.\n【69】 Operative mortality for surgical closure in most centers is <1 percent [15]. Surgical complications are infrequent and include residual shunts, typically around the patch (which usually are trivial and may resolve spontaneously), and in patients with membranous or inlet defects, there is a risk of right bundle branch block and complete heart block [21]. The risks of surgery are increased in children who have elevated PVR. These children must be monitored closely in the postoperative period because PAP is labile. Hypoxia may result in sudden and dramatic changes in resistance with a concomitant decrease in cardiac output.\n【70】 Transcatheter closure — Successful transcatheter closure for muscular, perimembranous, and residual VSDs following surgical repair has been reported in several series [22-25]. Transcatheter closure of VSD remains technically challenging with a higher complication rate than surgery, though it has gained popularity in some countries [26]. At our institution, transcatheter VSD closure is offered for patients with defects that are technically challenging to close operatively (eg, remote apical muscular defect, multiple muscular defects [\"Swiss cheese\" septum]) or for patients unable to undergo cardiopulmonary bypass for various reasons. Transcatheter closure of VSD is associated with a higher incidence of atrioventricular block and valve injury as compared with surgery. Transcatheter VSD closure should be performed in centers with considerable experience and expertise in interventional catheterization techniques and with surgical backup [1,4].\n【71】 Ventricular arrhythmia, heart block, bleeding, and valvular damage are all potential complications of transcatheter closure [23,24]. In general, patients require careful monitoring during follow-up to detect any post-procedure complications (eg, complete heart block) that may require further intervention. Closure of perimembranous defects is particularly associated with complete heart block [27]. A presumed mechanism is that the RV retention disk overlaps the ventricular conduction system as it passes above or anterosuperiorly to the defect. Affected patients may require a permanent pacemaker post-procedure [24].\n【72】 HEALTH CARE MAINTENANCE — Important aspects of long-term health care maintenance in children with VSDs, particularly those who have not undergone repair, include:\n【73】 Immunizations — Children with VSDs should receive all routine childhood vaccinations, including pneumococcal, influenza, and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines. (See  \"Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention with vaccines\" and  \"Pneumococcal vaccination in children\" and  \"COVID-19: Vaccines\", section on 'Children'.)\n【74】 In addition, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) immunoprophylaxis is recommended to prevent RSV infections in infants <1 year old with VSD and heart failure, as summarized in the table (table 1) and discussed in detail separately. (See  \"Seasonal influenza in children: Prevention with vaccines\" and  \"Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Prevention in infants and children\", section on 'Congenital heart disease'.)\n【75】 Monitoring of growth parameters — It is important to monitor growth and development in children with VSDs, as it is in all children. Feeding difficulties and poor weight gain are often the earliest clinical signs of heart failure in young infants and children. Infants should be followed every two weeks initially to assess growth parameters. If nutritional needs are not met, the infant will initially fail to gain weight appropriately and nutritional support may be warranted. (See  \"Normal growth patterns in infants and prepubertal children\" and 'Nutritional support' above.)\n【76】 Monitoring for symptoms of heart failure — Between visits with the cardiac specialist, the primary care provider should monitor for symptoms related to heart failure. If the patient becomes symptomatic (eg, poor weight gain, tachypnea), the patient should be promptly referred to the specialist for cardiac evaluation. (See  \"Heart failure in children: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)\n【77】 Exercise and sports participation — The 2015 scientific statement of the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) provides competitive athletic participation guidelines for patients with congenital heart disease (CHD), including VSD [28]. They utilize the classification of sports based on increasing static and dynamic components (figure 1). These recommendations are in place to reduce and prevent sudden death; however, it should be noted that VSDs are not associated with sudden death in the absence of significant pulmonary hypertension. As with any guidelines, recommendations need to be tailored to the patient and a comprehensive evaluation by an experienced clinician is required.\n【78】 Our practice regarding competitive sports participation in patients with VSDs is generally consistent with the AHA/ACC guidelines:\n【79】 ●Patients with untreated small or restrictive VSDs can participate in all sports if they have no pulmonary hypertension.\n【80】 ●Patients with unrepaired large, hemodynamically significant VSDs and pulmonary hypertension may participate in only low-intensity (class IA) sports (figure 1).\n【81】 ●Patients who have undergone VSD repair (surgical or catheter-based) may participate in all sports two to three months after repair if they are asymptomatic with no or a small residual defect and no evidence of pulmonary hypertension, tachyarrhythmia, or ventricular dysfunction.\n【82】 ●Patients with persistent mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension or moderate ventricular dysfunction following VSD repair may participate in only low-intensity (class IA) sports.\n【83】 ●Patients with symptomatic tachyarrhythmias or second- or third-degree atrioventricular block following VSD repair should not participate in competitive sports until further evaluation by an electrophysiologist.\n【84】 Physical activity and sports participation in patients with CHD are discussed in detail separately. (See  \"Physical activity and exercise in patients with congenital heart disease\".)\n【85】 Antibiotic prophylaxis — Our practice regarding endocarditis prophylaxis is consistent with the guidelines of the AHA, which recommend no antibiotic prophylaxis in children with an isolated VSD, except in the following circumstances:\n【86】 ●In children with repaired VSD, which required the use of prosthetic material or device, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for dental and respiratory tract procedures during the first six months after the repair.\n【87】 ●In children with repaired VSD with a residual defect at the site or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic device, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended for dental and respiratory tract procedures.\n【88】 Antimicrobial prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis is discussed in greater detail separately. (See  \"Prevention of endocarditis: Antibiotic prophylaxis and other measures\".)\n【89】 OUTCOME — The long-term outcome for children with VSDs is generally excellent. In a report of the United Kingdom Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey, the estimated 20-year survival rate of children with VSDs born between 1985 and 2003 was 98.3 percent [29].\n【90】 In a national registry study that included data on 3495 children with isolated VSD born between 1994 and 2009, surgical or transcatheter closure was performed in only 5 percent of cases [30]. There was no operative mortality, and no excess mortality in children with isolated VSDs compared with children without VSDs (overall mortality was 0.3 percent; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.8 [95% CI 0.5 to 1.4]). Long-term cardiac complications observed in this cohort were rare, including arrhythmias (0.5 percent), aortic regurgitation (0.3 percent), endocarditis (0.1 percent), and pulmonary hypertension (<0.1 percent).\n【91】 ●Outcome following surgical repair – Operative mortality for surgical VSD repair in most centers is <1 percent [15]. Early surgical repair results in near-normal long-term growth in the vast majority of patients, and most survivors remain asymptomatic and lead normal lives [16-19,31-34]. In a report from a single center of 215 patients with isolated VSD who underwent surgical repair at a median age of 10 months from 2000 to 2006, there were three deaths over a mean follow-up of 2.1 years (one death occurred during surgery) [35]. Of the 212 survivors, 211 were asymptomatic from a cardiac standpoint and required no antiarrhythmic agents or pacing. (See 'Surgical repair' above.)\n【92】 ●Outcome following transcatheter closure – Procedure-related mortality with transcatheter VSD closure is rare (0.2 percent in one large registry study) [36]. The procedure is associated with higher complication rate than is surgery, particularly complete heart block, which occurs in 2 to 6 percent of patients following transcatheter VSD closure [24,36,37]. Data are limited on long-term outcomes following transcatheter VSD closure because the procedure is still relatively new and it is performed far less often than surgical VSD repair. In addition, many published case series include both pediatric and adult patients (including patients with post-myocardial infarction VSD) and therefore do not accurately reflect the outcomes of young patients with isolated congenital VSD. (See 'Transcatheter closure' above.)\n【93】 ●Outcomes for children managed without VSD closure – Many children with hemodynamically insignificant VSDs remain asymptomatic and therefore do not undergo closure of the defect. For the vast majority of these patients, the VSD closes spontaneously and/or there are no long-term consequences [38]. (See  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Natural history'.)\n【94】 INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, \"The Basics\" and \"Beyond the Basics.\" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【95】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or email these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on \"patient info\" and the keyword[s] of interest.)\n【96】 ●Basics topic (see  \"Patient education: Ventricular septal defects in children (The Basics)\")\n【97】 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n【98】 ●Newborn follow-up – Patients diagnosed as newborns with moderate to large ventricular septal defects (VSDs) need to be closely followed in the first weeks of life, as this is the time period when onset of heart failure is most likely. In our practice, patients who are well appearing are scheduled for follow-up with a pediatric cardiologist after delivery at three to four weeks of age. In the interim, patients are seen by their primary care provider who monitors growth, changes in the cardiac examination, and the development of signs related to heart failure (eg, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, poor weight gain or failure to thrive, and diaphoresis particularly with feeding). Any of these signs or symptoms should prompt an earlier appointment with the pediatric cardiologist. (See 'Neonates' above and  \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical features'.)\n【99】 ●Management approach – The management of VSDs is primarily dependent on the size of the defect, degree of shunting, and the likelihood of spontaneous closure. Our general approach is as follows (algorithm 1):\n【100】 ●Surgical versus transcatheter closure – Most patients who require VSD closure undergo primary patch surgical closure, which is associated with excellent outcomes (ie, low surgical mortality, low complication rates, and low reoperation rates). Transcatheter closure is generally reserved for patients with defects that are not amenable to surgical repair (eg, multiple muscular defects that may be difficult to visualize at the time of surgery). Transcatheter VSD closure is technically challenging and should be performed only in centers with considerable experience and expertise in interventional catheterization techniques and with surgical backup. (See 'Surgical repair' above and 'Transcatheter closure' above.)\n【101】 ●Long-term management – Important aspects of long-term health care maintenance in children with VSDs, particularly those who have not undergone repair, include administering routine childhood vaccinations, monitoring growth parameters, monitoring for symptoms of heart failure, and providing guidance regarding exercise and sports participation. Antibiotic prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis is not necessary for children with VSDs except during the first six months following repair with prosthetic material or device and/or following repair if there is a residual defect at or adjacent to the site of a prosthetic device. (See 'Health care maintenance' above and  \"Prevention of endocarditis: Antibiotic prophylaxis and other measures\".)\n【102】 ACKNOWLEDGMENT — The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Thomas Graham Jr, MD, and Kirsten Dummer, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.", "title": "婴儿与儿童单纯室间隔缺损的管理", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/management-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-vsds-in-infants-and-children?search=%E5%AE%A4%E9%97%B4%E9%9A%94%E7%BC%BA%E6%8D%9F%E4%B8%8D%E4%BC%B4%E6%98%BE%E8%91%97%E8%A1%80%E6%B6%B2%E5%8A%A8%E5%8A%9B%E5%AD%A6%E6%94%B9%E5%8F%98&source=search_result&selectedTitle=4%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

This topic will discuss prenatal diagnosis and obstetric management of pregnancies complicated by fetal body stalk anomaly or cloacal exstrophy. Management of infants with bladder exstrophy is reviewed separately. (See  \"Clinical manifestations and initial management of infants with bladder exstrophy\".)\n【2】 VALUE OF PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS — Prenatal diagnosis informs parents about the health and prognosis of their unborn child and thus helps them make informed decisions about the pregnancy within the context of their own value system. These decisions may involve pregnancy continuation/termination, choice of health care provider (eg, is specialty care needed?), birth site (eg, is a higher level of newborn care needed?), and palliative care for newborns with life-threatening conditions. Prenatal diagnosis also helps the patient prepare other family members, particularly children, for what to expect and provides an opportunity to engage with support groups. These issues apply to body stalk anomaly because it is generally considered to be lethal, with rare exceptions [1]. They apply to cloacal exstrophy because it generally requires multiple and complex surgical procedures and had long-term implications regarding continence, kidney function, fertility, and body image. (See  \"Surgical management and postoperative outcome of children with bladder exstrophy\".)\n【3】 BODY STALK ANOMALY\n【4】 Definition — Body stalk anomaly is massive and generally lethal malformation of the thorax and/or abdomen, often associated with limb abnormalities and severe scoliosis. The intrathoracic and abdominal organs lie outside of the abdominal cavity and are contained within a sac comprised of amnioperitoneal membrane attached directly to the placenta (picture 1) [2,3]. The umbilical cord may be completely absent or extremely shortened.\n【5】 Pathogenesis — Possible causes of body stalk anomaly include early amnion rupture resulting in amniotic bands that exert direct mechanical pressure on the developing embryo/fetus, vascular disruption of the early embryo, or an abnormality in the germinal disk [4]. Pathogenic variants in genes related to embryogenesis may play a role [5].\n【6】 The germinal disk abnormality is thought to represent complete failure of body folding along all three axes (cephalic, lateral, and caudal) during the sixth postmenstrual week [6]. Normal body folding results in separation of the intraembryonic coelom (future peritoneal cavity) from the extraembryonic coelom, formation of the body stalk, and development of the umbilical cord [7]. Abnormal cephalic folding results in a defect in the thoracic wall and epigastrium, allowing development of ectopia cordis (image 1). Abnormal lateral folding results in herniation of the midabdominal contents into a large wide-based amnioperitoneal sac, which inserts peripherally onto the placental chorionic plate in lieu of an umbilical cord or with a very short umbilical cord. Due to extrusion of the intraabdominal and thoracic contents, the spine and thoracic cavity do not develop symmetrically, which results in severe kyphoscoliosis and other abnormalities of the axial skeleton. Malrotation of the spine and incomplete closure of the pelvis can lead to malrotated limbs and/or clubfeet.\n【7】 In one series of 16 infants with body stalk anomaly, 10 infants had unilateral renal agenesis, as well as malformations or absence of the genitalia, urinary bladder, or both [8]. All these findings would be consistent with aberrant caudal folding, but there are also case reports describing an intact bladder retained in the abdomen, where a caudal fold defect would not likely be involved. Such heterogeneity would be consistent with select Hox gene mutations [5].\n【8】 Prevalence and epidemiology — Body stalk anomaly is rare; reported prevalence ranges from 0.4 to 3.2 per 100,000 live births and stillbirths [8]. However, this range likely under-represents the true prevalence because it does not account for fetal losses due to miscarriage and termination of pregnancy. For example, four cases were noted among 6952 sonographic examinations of nuchal translucency performed at 11 to 14 weeks of gestation in a single institution (58 per 100,000 first trimester pregnancies) [9].\n【9】 The prevalence appears to be increased in twins [8]. Monochorionic twins may concordant or discordant for the anomaly [10-12].\n【10】 Prevalence does not appear to be affected by parental age or fetal sex.\n【11】 Postnatal findings — The postnatal diagnosis of body stalk anomaly is based on characteristic findings on physical examination: a defective thoracoabdominal wall with thoracoabdominal organs outside of the abdominal cavity in a sac adherent to the placenta (picture 2 and picture 3 and picture 1). The umbilical cord is absent or very short (<10 cm) and skeletal abnormalities are common [8].\n【12】 Prenatal diagnosis\n【13】 Imaging — Ultrasound examination should be performed at a center with sonographic expertise for making the diagnosis and delineating the multitude of anatomical abnormalities.\n【14】 Body stalk anomaly should be strongly suspected when a massive midline thoracoabdominal wall defect is noted in a fetus with skeletal anomalies, especially severe scoliosis or lordosis (present in three-quarters of patients [4]) and an absent or extremely short umbilical cord [13-18]. The peritoneal cavity retains its communication with the extracoelomic cavity, which extends to the margins of the placenta [19]. The massive amnioperitoneal-lined sac may contain portions of the lungs, heart, liver, spleen, bowel, kidneys, and bladder; in female fetuses ovaries, tubes, and uterus may herniate [19]. Usually only two umbilical vessels are present and do not spiral while coursing along the amnioperitoneal membrane [15,19]. In the second trimester, oligohydramnios is common.\n【15】 Diagnostic images:\n【16】 Alpha-fetoprotein — The second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level is elevated in 100 percent of cases [20].\n【17】 Associated abnormalities — Urogenital organs are commonly affected. In one series of 16 infants with body stalk anomaly, 10 infants had unilateral renal agenesis, as well as malformations or absence of the genitalia, urinary bladder, or both [8]. Nine infants had anal atresia and/or severe limb reduction defects (two with amelia, four with phocomelia, three with unspecified reduction defects). All of the limb defects were unilateral, only one infant had more than one limb affected, and all but one (phocomelia of an arm) involved a lower limb. Others have also reported a preponderance of lower limb defects [21].\n【18】 Genetic studies — Only two cases of body stalk anomaly associated with an abnormal karyotype have been reported (confined placental trisomy 16 and uniparental disomy 16 in one case [22] and mosaic trisomy 2 on chorionic villous sampling in the other case [23]). This may be an underestimate given the small number of reported cases; however, many cases of body stalk anomaly with normal karyotype have been reported [8]. We offer microarray in all cases. (See  \"Prenatal genetic evaluation of the fetus with anomalies or soft markers\".)\n【19】 Differential diagnosis — The differential diagnosis of major abdominal wall defects is described in the table (table 1). The combination of exteriorization of thoracoabdominal organs, scoliosis, and an abnormality at the cord insertion site suggests body stalk anomaly, rather than omphalocele or gastroschisis, which are the two most common abdominal wall defects. The fetal cord insertion site is umbilical in both omphalocele and gastroschisis; however, the abdominal wall defect is at the base of the cord in omphalocele but paraumbilical in gastroschisis. In body stalk anomaly, the umbilical cord is absent or not visualized and the anterior abdominal wall is partially formed or absent. (See  \"Gastroschisis\" and  \"Omphalocele: Prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy management\".)\n【20】 Amniotic band sequence can mimic a body stalk anomaly because the bands cause abdominal wall disruption too. However, amniotic band sequence would involve other, non-abdominal wall structures such as the limbs, face, or cranium, as well as a shredded amniotic membrane. (See  \"Amniotic band sequence\".)\n【21】 Obstetric management\n【22】 Recurrence risk — Most cases are sporadic.\n【23】 CLOACAL EXSTROPHY\n【24】 Definition — Cloacal exstrophy is a severe multi-system congenital malformation involving defects of the genitourinary, gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and neurologic systems. The disorder is also known as OEIS complex (omphalocele-exstrophy-imperforate anus-spinal dysraphism) [25].\n【25】 Pathogenesis — The pathogenesis of cloacal exstrophy is unclear. During the fifth and sixth postmenstrual weeks, the human embryo is transformed from a flat disc-shaped organism into two tubes, one dorsal to the other, surrounded by supporting structures in the body wall [26]. Based on histopathologic studies in human embryos, cloacal exstrophy most likely results from a very early defect in the closure of the ventral body wall rather than an abnormality related to premature rupture of the cloacal membrane [27]. Greater concordance among monozygotic than dizygotic twins supports a genetic basis for the disorder [27] or an error in embryological development related to monozygotic twinning [28].\n【26】 Prevalence and epidemiology — Cloacal exstrophy is a rare event, occurring in fewer than 1 in 100,000 births [27]. Epidemiology is poorly understood because of the rarity of the disorder. Prevalence appears to be higher in females. Although variability in prevalence by geographic location has been observed, this is most likely an artifact related to the small number of cases.\n【27】 Postnatal findings — The postnatal diagnosis of cloacal exstrophy is based on physical examination showing the characteristic clinical findings (picture 4):\n【28】 In addition, the bladder is split into hemibladders that flank the openings of the small intestine and blind-ending large intestine and contain the orifices of the ureters and vasa deferentia in males and the uterovaginal canal in females [29]. In males, the penis and scrotum are split in two or the penis is flat and short with hypospadias. In females, the clitoris is split, there may be two vaginal openings, and the vulvae are rudimentary. Vesico-intestinal, urethral-intestinal, or ureteral-intestinal fistula may be present [30,31].\n【29】 Imaging — Ultrasound examination should be performed at a center with sonographic expertise for making the diagnosis and delineating the spectrum of anatomical abnormalities.\n【30】 Prenatal diagnosis of cloacal exstrophy is based on ultrasound identification of the features most commonly present in the complex (image 8). The accuracy of sonographic diagnosis appears to be less than 25 percent due to the rarity of the disorder and the wide spectrum of anatomic variants, which depend upon the degree of cloacal septation completed [32,33]. There is also lack of consensus regarding its clinical components\n【31】 In one of the largest series of patients with cloacal exstrophy in whom prenatal sonography was available (22 cases), major criteria for the complex were defined as findings that occurred in >50 percent of cases [34]:\n【32】 Minor criteria were defined as findings that occurred in <50 percent of cases [34]:\n【33】 Malformations in other organ systems (eg, congenital heart defects, rib defects, microcephaly, tracheoesophageal fistula, encephalocele, diaphragmatic hernia) have been described in case reports and small case series compiled over decades [27]. A prolapsed terminal ileum resembling the trunk of an elephant on ultrasound has been reported as a finding unique to cloacal exstrophy [36].\n【34】 Color Doppler sonography to identify the perivesical umbilical arteries at the normal bladder location can help delineate the origin of a mass (eg, bladder) in the lower abdomen [37]. Three-dimensional ultrasound and/or fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are adjunctive imaging modalities that can be used to assist in clarifying uncertain two-dimensional ultrasound findings [38,39].\n【35】 Amniotic fluid volume can be low, normal, or increased [40].\n【36】 Alpha-fetoprotein — Second trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level is elevated; levels of 20 to 30 MoMs have been reported [41].\n【37】 Genetic studies — Cloacal exstrophy has not been reported to be associated with specific aneuploidies. Nonetheless, karyotyping should be considered since it may influence the decision to terminate the pregnancy, perform a cesarean birth for fetal indications, or initiate a series of corrective operations in the newborn period versus palliative care [42].\n【38】 Differential diagnosis — Differential diagnoses are described in the table (table 1). Nonvisualization of the bladder in a fetus with abdominal and spinal defects suggests cloacal exstrophy. Simple bladder exstrophy is not typically associated with fetal anomalies in other organ systems. The bladder can be visualized in omphalocele and gastroschisis, the two most common abdominal wall defects. (See  \"Gastroschisis\" and  \"Omphalocele: Prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy management\".)\n【39】 Neonatal management — Saline-soaked sterile dressings are applied over the exposed bladder and bowel mucosa and covered with plastic wrap to minimize insensible fluid and heat loss [46]. Immediate consultation with neonatologists, pediatric surgeons, and neurosurgeons is important for operative planning, but emergency surgery is not necessary. (See  \"Clinical manifestations and initial management of infants with bladder exstrophy\".)\n【40】 Ultrasound is performed to evaluate the presence or absence of kidneys, hydroureter, and hydronephrosis [46]. The latter two abnormalities may require preoperative decompression. The newborn’s spinal cord and brain should be evaluated by ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging to detect tethered cord, myelodysplasia, hydrocephalus, or other central nervous system abnormalities. Radiographic images provide important information about the presence or absence of vertebral or pelvic-sacral abnormalities.\n【41】 Karyotype may help in assigning biologic sex, if genetic studies were not performed prenatally. There are also significant psychological-emotional concerns about gender reassignment from male to female. Decisions about gender assignment and surgery in patients with a disorder of sexual organ development are complicated by societal and family expectations, the variability of phenotype, the uncertainty of adult gender identity, and by the lack of adequately sized studies of long-term outcomes. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See  \"Management of the infant with atypical genital appearance (difference of sex development)\".)\n【42】 Repair — The surgical management of newborns with cloacal exstrophy is technically challenging and a series of complex reconstructive operations is often necessary [46]. For example, the omphalocele needs to be repaired, a urinary bladder needs to be constructed, the separation between the pubic bones need to be reduced and the pelvis stabilized, and intestinal management of the often small and shortened colon needs to be addressed. The major goal is to help the patient achieve bowel control, urinary control, and satisfactory sexual function [47]. Patients are best served in centers that specialize in the care of newborns with this malformation sequence. The presence of motor impairments or organ dysfunction (eg, bladder overdistension/neurogenic bladder) as the result of an associated neural tube defect will impact the timing and nature of the perineal repair.\n【43】 In one study that described the process of achieving continence (defined as a dry interval greater than three hours without leakage at night) in patients with cloacal exstrophy, continence procedures included bladder neck reconstruction with or without augmentation, bladder neck transection with continent urinary diversion, augmentation cystoplasty, or use of injectable bulking agents [48]. At the time of analysis, 71 percent of patients who underwent a continence procedure were dry, the median number of urologic procedures to reach urinary continence was four (range 2 to 10), and the median age when continence was achieved was 11 years.\n【44】 Prognosis — Survival rates of 83 to 100 percent have been reported since the 1980s and attributed to advances in hyperalimentation, neonatal intensive care, and surgical reconstruction techniques [46,49,50]. The residual mortality rate reflects both the severity of the malformations encountered and complications associated with preterm birth [46].\n【45】 Quality-of-life issues remain a concern [51,52]. Two systematic reviews of 12 studies that assessed long-term functional outcomes of patients with cloacal malformation reported the following types and frequencies of outcomes: urinary incontinence (9.1 to 85 percent), sexual function issues related to vaginal anomalies (8.3 to 71.3 percent), uterine anomalies (14.3 to 71 percent), gender identity issues in 46, XY patients raised female (11.1 to 66.7 percent), impaired ambulatory capacity (13.8 percent) [52], fecal soiling (71 percent), and constipation (51 percent) [51].\n【46】 Female patients have a high incidence of gynecologic problems at menarche and in early adult life [53]. Reassessment at early puberty by ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and vaginoscopy has been recommended as additional surgery may be necessary to improve sexual/reproductive function [54]. Paternity has not been documented among males [52]. Expert management is crucial to achieve optimum quality of life, particularly as children transition into adulthood.\n【47】 Recurrence risk — The genetics of the malformation sequence are not well defined, but there is a higher incidence of cloacal exstrophy in families in which one member is affected as compared with the general population [46]. Greater concordance among monozygotic twins than dizygotic twins also supports a genetic basis for the disorder [27].\n【48】 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS", "title": "Body stalk anomaly and cloacal exstrophy", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/body-stalk-anomaly-and-cloacal-exstrophy?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B0%E7%94%9F%E5%84%BF%E8%84%91%E7%A7%AF%E6%B0%B4&source=search_result&selectedTitle=23%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

Frequencies reported may include concomitant administration with other vaccines. Adverse reactions reported in children, adolescents, and adults.\n【16】 >10%:\n【17】 Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea (8% to 13%; severe diarrhea: <1%), nausea (18% to 24%; severe nausea: 4%)\n【18】 Local: Erythema at injection site (12% to 50%), induration at injection site (28% to 32%), pain at injection site (76% to 90%), swelling at injection site (14% to 18%)\n【19】 Nervous system: Chills (12% to 25%), fatigue (35% to 54%; severe fatigue: 2% to 6%), headache (33% to 52%; severe headache: 1% to 6%)\n【20】 Neuromuscular & skeletal: Arthralgia (13% to 22%; severe arthralgia: ≤2%), myalgia (16% to 49%; severe myalgia: ≤13%)\n【21】 1% to 10%:\n【22】 Gastrointestinal: Vomiting (2% to 4%)\n【23】 Respiratory: Nasopharyngitis (≥2%)\n【24】 Miscellaneous: Fever (1% to 7%)\n【25】 Postmarking:\n【26】 Cardiovascular: Syncope, vasodepressor syncope\n【27】 Dermatologic: Injection site blister formation, skin rash\n【28】 Hematologic & oncologic: Lymphadenopathy\n【29】 Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction\n【30】 Local: Injection site nodule\n【31】 Ophthalmic: Swelling of eye\n【32】 Contraindications\n【33】 Severe hypersensitivity to the meningococcal group B vaccine or any component of the formulation.\n【34】 Warnings/Precautions\n【35】 • Anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions: Immediate treatment (including epinephrine 1 mg/mL) for anaphylactoid and/or hypersensitivity reactions should be available during vaccine use (ACIP [Kroger 2021]).\n【36】 • Shoulder injury related to vaccine administration: Vaccine administration that is too high on the upper arm may cause shoulder injury (eg, shoulder bursitis, tendinopathy) resulting in shoulder pain and reduced range of motion following injection. Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).\n【37】 • Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Kroger 2021]).\n【38】 • Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. Defer administration in patients with moderate or severe acute illness (with or without fever); vaccination should not be delayed for patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Kroger 2021]).\n【39】 • Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Kroger 2021]).\n【40】 • Meningococcal infections: Not to be used to treat meningococcal infections or to provide immunity against N. meningitidis serogroups A, C, W-135, or Y. In addition, vaccine does not provide protection against all circulating meningococcal group B strains.\n【41】 • Anticoagulant therapy: Use with caution in patients receiving anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration; ideally, vaccinations should be administered prior to initiation of anticoagulant therapy if possible (ACIP [Kroger 2021]).\n【42】 • Vaccines: In order to maximize vaccination rates, the ACIP recommends simultaneous administration (ie, >1 vaccine on the same day at different anatomic sites) of all age-appropriate vaccines (live or inactivated) for which a person is eligible at a single clinic visit, unless contraindications exist. Because of differences in components and dosing regimen, meningococcal group B vaccines are not interchangeable (ACIP [Kroger 2021]).\n【43】 • Altered immunocompetence: Patients with complement component deficiencies, anatomic or functional asplenia, and patients receiving complement inhibitors (eg, eculizumab, ravulizumab) are at an increased risk for invasive meningococcal infection, including post-vaccination. Consider deferring immunization during periods of severe immunosuppression (eg, patients receiving chemo/radiation therapy or other immunosuppressive therapy [including high-dose corticosteroids]); may have a reduced response to vaccination. In general, household and close contacts of persons with altered immunocompetence may receive all age appropriate vaccines. Inactivated vaccines should be administered ≥2 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression when feasible; inactivated vaccines administered during chemotherapy should be readministered after immune competence is regained (ACIP [Kroger 2021]; IDSA [Rubin 2014]).\n【44】 • Pediatric: Apnea has occurred following intramuscular vaccine administration in premature infants; consider clinical status implications. In general, preterm infants should be vaccinated at the same chronological age as full-term infants (AAP [Saari 2003]; ACIP [Kroger 2021]).\n【45】 • Kanamycin: May contain kanamycin.\n【46】 • Latex: Note: Prior to April 2023, the Bexsero prescribing information stated the product packaging contained latex. The Bexsero prescribing information approved by the FDA in April 2023 states the packaging is not made with latex. Providers should confirm if product in inventory contains latex prior to administering to patients with a latex allergy.\n【47】 • Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.\n【48】 • Antipyretics: Antipyretics have not been shown to prevent febrile seizures; antipyretics may be used to treat fever or discomfort following vaccination (ACIP [Kroger 2021]). One study reported that routine prophylactic administration of acetaminophen to prevent fever prior to vaccination decreased the immune response of some vaccines; the clinical significance of this reduction in immune response has not been established (Prymula 2009).\n【49】 • Appropriate use: Use of this vaccine for specific medical and/or other indications (eg, immunocompromising conditions, hepatic or kidney disease, diabetes) is also addressed in the annual ACIP Recommended Immunization Schedules (refer to CDC schedule for detailed information).\n【50】 • Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends on multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) and may be improved by administering the vaccine at the recommended dose, route, and interval. Vaccines may not be effective if administered during periods of altered immune competence (ACIP [Kroger 2021]).\n【51】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【52】 Clinical studies of infants <12 months of age using a lower dosage than indicated for older children resulted in fever in most patients (90%).\n【53】 Dosage Forms: US\n【54】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【55】 Suspension Prefilled Syringe, Intramuscular:\n【56】 Bexsero:  (0.5 mL)\n【57】 Suspension Prefilled Syringe, Intramuscular [preservative free]:\n【58】 Trumenba:  (0.5 mL) [contains polysorbate 80]\n【59】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【60】 No\n【61】 Administration: Pediatric\n【62】 Shake vigorously to ensure that a homogenous white suspension is obtained. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended. Administer by IM injection into upper deltoid region; not for intradermal, subcutaneous, or IV administration. Do not mix with other vaccines or injections; separate needles and syringes should be used for each injection (Ref). To prevent syncope related injuries, adolescents should be vaccinated while seated or lying down (Ref). US law requires that the date of administration, the vaccine manufacturer, lot number of vaccine, vaccine information statement (VIS) edition date and date it was provided, and the administering person's name, title, and address be recorded.\n【63】 For patients at risk of hemorrhage, the vaccine should be administered IM if, in the opinion of a physician familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable safety. If the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A fine needle (23-gauge or smaller) can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection. Patients on anticoagulant therapy should be considered to have the same bleeding risks and treated as those with clotting factor disorders (Ref).\n【64】 Administration: Adult\n【65】 For patients at risk of hemorrhage, the vaccine should be administered IM if, in the opinion of a health care provider familiar with the patient's bleeding risk, the vaccine can be administered by this route with reasonable safety. If the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM vaccination can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered. A fine needle (23-gauge or smaller) can be used for the vaccination and firm pressure applied to the site (without rubbing) for at least 2 minutes. The patient or family should be instructed concerning the risk of hematoma from the injection. Patients on anticoagulant therapy should be considered to have the same bleeding risks and treated as those with clotting factor disorders (Ref).\n【66】 Storage/Stability\n【67】 Bexsero: Store between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Do not freeze; discard if frozen. Protect from light.\n【68】 Trumenba: Store between 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Do not freeze; discard if frozen. Store syringes in the refrigerator horizontally (lying flat on the shelf) to minimize the redispersion time.\n【69】 Medication Guide and/or Vaccine Information Statement (VIS)\n【70】 In the United States, the appropriate CDC-approved Vaccine Information Statement (VIS) must be provided to the patient/caregiver before administering each dose of this vaccine; the VIS edition date and date it was provided to the patient/caregiver should be recorded as required by US law. VIS is available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/vis/vis-statements/mening-serogroup.html.\n【71】 Use\n【72】 Active immunization against invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (FDA approved in ages 10 to 25 years).\n【73】 The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of the following persons ≥10 years of age with increased risk of meningococcal disease (CDC/ACIP [Mbaeyi 2020]):\n【74】 • Persons with complement component deficiencies (eg, C3, C5-C9, properdin, factor H, or factor D deficiencies; patients receiving complement inhibitors [eg, eculizumab, ravulizumab]).\n【75】 • Persons with anatomic or functional asplenia (including sickle cell disease).\n【76】 • Microbiologists routinely exposed to isolates of N. meningitidis.\n【77】 • Persons identified to be at increased risk during an outbreak caused by serogroup B meningococcal disease.\n【78】 The ACIP states that a meningococcal group B vaccination series may be administered to adolescents and young adults aged 16 to 23 years as determined by shared clinical decision-making to provide short-term protection against most strains of serogroup B meningococcal disease. The preferred age for vaccination is 16 to 18 years (CDC/ACIP [Mbaeyi 2020]).\n【79】 The Canadian National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends use in patients ≥2 months of age (Bexsero) or ≥10 years of age (Trumenba) at high risk for serogroup B meningococcal disease (including due to disease outbreaks); NACI also states that meningococcal B vaccination may be considered on an individual basis in healthy patients (NACI/CATMAT 2015; NACI 2019).\n【80】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【81】 None known.\n【82】 Drug Interactions\n【83】 (For additional information: Launch drug interactions program)\n【84】 Acetaminophen: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines. Management: Consider avoiding routine prophylactic use of acetaminophen before or during vaccine administration when possible. Acetaminophen is still recommended to treat fevers and/or pain that occurs after vaccination. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【85】 Anti-CD20 B-Cell Depleting Therapies: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated/Non-Replicating). Management: Give inactivated vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to initiation or 6 months after anti-CD20 B-cell depleting therapies. If vaccinated prior to B cell recovery, consider assessing immune response to vaccination. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【86】 Cladribine: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated/Non-Replicating). Management: Give inactivated vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of cladribine when possible. Patients vaccinated less than 14 days before initiating or during cladribine should be revaccinated at least 3 months after therapy is complete. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【87】 Corticosteroids (Systemic): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated/Non-Replicating). Management: Administer vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to immunosuppressive corticosteroids if possible. If patients are vaccinated less than 14 days prior to or during such therapy, repeat vaccination at least 3 months after therapy if immunocompetence restored. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【88】 Eculizumab: Meningococcal Group B Vaccine may diminish the therapeutic effect of Eculizumab. The meningococcal vaccine may result in increased complement activation, possibly worsening the symptoms of any underlying complement-mediated diseases, such as hemolysis and anemia. Eculizumab may diminish the therapeutic effect of Meningococcal Group B Vaccine.  Management: Administer meningococcal vaccine at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of eculizumab in unvaccinated patients. If eculizumab is indicated urgently, administer meningococcal vaccine as soon as possible and administer 2 weeks of antibiotic prophylaxis. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【89】 Elivaldogene Autotemcel: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Vaccines. Specifically, there may be a greater risk for contracting an infection from any live vaccine. Elivaldogene Autotemcel may diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines. Management: Administration of vaccines is not recommended in the 6 weeks before myeloablative conditioning, and until hematologic recovery after elivaldogene autotemcel treatment. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【90】 Fingolimod: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated/Non-Replicating). Management: Vaccine efficacy may be reduced. Complete all age-appropriate vaccinations at least 2 weeks prior to starting fingolimod. If vaccinated during fingolimod therapy, revaccinate 2 to 3 months after fingolimod discontinuation. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【91】 Immunosuppressants (Cytotoxic Chemotherapy): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated/Non-Replicating). Management: Give inactivated vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of chemotherapy when possible. Patients vaccinated less than 14 days before initiating or during chemotherapy should be revaccinated at least 3 months after therapy is complete. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【92】 Immunosuppressants (Miscellaneous Oncologic Agents): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated/Non-Replicating). Management: Give inactivated vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of immunosuppressants when possible. Patients vaccinated less than 14 days before initiating or during therapy should be revaccinated at least 3 after therapy is complete. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【93】 Immunosuppressants (Therapeutic Immunosuppressant Agents): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated/Non-Replicating). Management: Give inactivated vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of immunosuppressants when possible. Patients vaccinated less than 14 days before initiating or during therapy should be revaccinated at least 2 to 3 months after therapy is complete. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【94】 Methotrexate: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated/Non-Replicating). Management: Administer vaccines at least 2 weeks prior to methotrexate initiation, if possible. If patients are vaccinated less than 14 days prior to or during methotrexate therapy, repeat vaccination at least 3 months after therapy if immunocompetence restored. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【95】 Propacetamol: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines. Management: Consider avoiding routine prophylactic use of propacetamol before or during vaccine administration when possible. Propacetamol is still recommended to treat fevers and/or pain that occurs after vaccination. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【96】 Siponimod: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated/Non-Replicating). Management: Avoid administration of vaccines (inactivated) during treatment with siponimod and for 1 month after discontinuation due to potential decreased vaccine efficacy. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【97】 Teplizumab: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines (Inactivated/Non-Replicating). Management: Vaccination with inactivated or non-replicating vaccines is not recommended in the 2 weeks prior to teplizumab therapy, during treatment, or for 6 weeks following completion of therapy. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【98】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【99】 Information related to the use of meningococcal group B vaccines in pregnancy is limited (CDC/ACIP [Mbaeyi 2020]).\n【100】 Inactivated vaccines have not been shown to cause increased risks to the fetus (ACIP [Kroger 2021]). However, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends deferring meningococcal group B vaccination during pregnancy unless the patient is at increased risk for meningococcal disease and vaccination benefits outweigh the potential risks.\n【101】 Monitoring Parameters\n【102】 Monitor for hypersensitivity and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Kroger 2021]). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.\n【103】 Mechanism of Action\n【104】 Bexsero: Induces immunity against meningococcal disease caused by serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB) via the formation of antibodies directed toward the recombinant protein antigens combined together with outer membrane vesicles (OMV) from a group B strain.\n【105】 Trumenba: Protection against invasive meningococcal disease is conferred mainly by complement-mediated antibody-dependent killing of N. meningitidis.\n【106】 Efficacy:\n【107】 Bexsero: Composite hSBA titer response one month after the second dose: 63% to 88%\n【108】 Trumenba: 84% of adolescents had a ≥4-fold rise in hSBA titer and composite response after the third dose.\n【109】 Brand Names: International\n【110】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Meningococcal group B vaccine (MenB-4C and MenB-FHbp)  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/meningococcal-group-b-vaccine-menb-4c-and-menb-fhbp-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E4%BD%8D%E4%BA%8E%E8%82%A9%E6%88%96%E4%B8%8A%E8%87%82%E6%B0%B4%E5%B9%B3%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E8%82%8C%E8%82%89%E3%80%81%E7%AD%8B%E8%86%9C%E6%88%96%E8%82%8C%E8%85%B1%E7%9A%84%E6%8D%9F%E4%BC%A4&source=search_result&selectedTitle=145%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

Among these species, 10 have been isolated from humans. The species responsible for the most serious diseases are Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae O1/O139 strains causing the disease cholera and other V. cholerae strains linked with diarrhea, wound infections, and septicemia), Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Vibrio vulnificus.\n【2】 EPIDEMIOLOGY COMMON TO VIBRIO SPECIES — All Vibrio species are free-living microorganisms in marine and estuarine environments. They are sensitive to temperature, with numbers of microorganisms in the environment increasing during warmer, summer months [10]. The number of Vibrio species isolated from human infections in the United States and reported to the Center for Disease Control clearly increases during the months of May to September, with 40 to 47 percent of cases occurring in July and August [11,12].\n【3】 SPECIES THAT PRIMARILY CAUSE DIARRHEA\n【4】 V. mimicus — V. mimicus, identified as a separate species in 1981 [15], was initially classified as \"atypical sucrose-negative V. cholerae.\" The species \"mimics\" V. cholerae in many biochemical tests, hence the name. Comparative genomic analysis suggests that V. mimicus and V. cholerae diverged from a common ancestor derived from the strain that caused the sixth cholera pandemic [16]. Despite the close genetic relationship with V. cholerae, V. mimicus do not cause epidemic cholera-like disease. Fewer than 10 percent of clinical isolates, and less than 1 percent of environmental isolates, produce cholera toxin [17]. Strains do, however, carry a variety of possible virulence factors [18,19], including genes for a type III secretion system that can be seen in V. parahaemolyticus [20]. (See  \"Vibrio parahaemolyticus infections\", section on 'Pathogenesis'.)\n【5】 Epidemiology — Consumption of seafood is the main risk factor for V. mimicus gastrointestinal infection. The microorganism has been isolated from shrimp and other shellfish in fish markets in Malaysia and Mexico [19,21,22] and from mussels in Italy [23]. In the US, occurrence of V. mimicus diarrhea has been associated with eating raw oysters and other shellfish, including crayfish [24,25]. In a large Thai outbreak, \"fish soup\" was implicated as the vehicle of transmission [26], and infection has been linked to consumption of raw turtle eggs in Costa Rica [27]. In a pattern analogous to that seen with non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae, the organism is likely to be introduced into communities through seafood, with further transmission in the developing world related to fecal contamination of food and water sources. Wound and ear infections occur to a lesser extent and are generally seen in the setting of exposure to estuarine waters [24], which serve as a reservoir for the microorganism.\n【6】 Clinical manifestations — Gastroenteritis, with typical symptoms of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramps, is the primary clinical manifestation of V. mimicus infection. While diarrhea is generally mild, occasional cases can be severe, requiring hospitalization for intravenous rehydration. Wound and ear infections occur rarely, as does bacteremia.\n【7】 V. fluvialis — V. fluvialis was identified as a separate species in 1981, with the name derived from the Latin for \"river,\" reflecting its early isolation from river and estuarine waters [28]. Strains do not appear to produce cholera toxin. They have been shown to have cytopathic/cytotoxic effects on HeLa cells [29], and to cause fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loops and diarrhea and death in infant mice [30,31]. V. fluvialis has been associated with high rates of bloody diarrhea, raising the possibility that it is invasive in the intestinal tract, despite reports that isolates are negative for invasiveness in laboratory testing [32]. A variety of potential virulence factors have been identified in genetic studies [33].\n【8】 Epidemiology — V. fluvialis is widely distributed in the estuarine and marine environment and has been isolated from shellfish and fish, including fish in Turkey [34], shrimp and other shellfish in fish markets in Malaysia [21], and mussels in Italy [23]. It is also recognized as an important pathogen for some marine species, with \"V. fluvialis-like\" strains identified as the cause of \"limp lobster\" syndrome [35] and isolates cultured from the blood of ill manatees [36].\n【9】 Clinical manifestations — Gastroenteritis is the primary clinical manifestation of V. fluvialis infection. Infections at other sites, including wounds and ears, also occur, with rare reports of bacteremia and death [40]. Among 100 persons with \"moderate to severe\" illness following cyclone Aila in whom V. fluvialis was implicated as the etiologic agent, symptoms included watery diarrhea (86 percent of patients), bloody diarrhea (62 percent), abdominal pain (57 percent), vomiting (41 percent), and fever (21 percent) [37]. In an earlier outbreak in Bangladesh (1976-77), 75 percent of patients were found to have blood cells and leukocytes in their stools on microscopic examination [32]. The duration of diarrhea with antibiotic therapy ranged from 16 to 80 hours.\n【10】 V. furnissii — V. furnissii, initially identified as biovar II for V. fluvialis, was designated as a separate species in 1983 [10]. A complete genome sequence has been reported for an environmental strain. It lacked the gene for cholera toxin, other cholera toxin-related toxins, and genes encoding a type III secretion system [41].\n【11】 Grimontia hollisae — G. hollisae, initially known as V. hollisae, was designated as a separate species in 1982. G. hollisae is known to have a type III secretion system and produce a thermostable direct hemolysin [47], which has been linked with hepatotoxicity in studies in mice [48].\n【12】 SPECIES THAT PRIMARILY CAUSE WOUND INFECTION\n【13】 V. alginolyticus — V. alginolyticus is widely distributed in the environment [54,55], has been isolated from fish and shellfish [56], and is recognized as a major pathogen for fish and crustaceans. It is the most common cause of Vibrio-associated wound infections in the United States (table 1) [57]. It has also been associated with otitis, particularly in children. Wound infections and otitis are almost all associated with exposure to marine or estuarine waters [57]. In immunocompromised patients and patients with underlying liver disease, there are rare reports of severe wound infections, including necrotizing fasciitis [58].Rare cases of bacteremia are reported, almost always associated with wound infections, and generally in immunocompromised or burn patients [59,60]. In contrast to other Vibrio species, it is only rarely isolated from stool (ie, in 5 percent of cases reported to CDC between 1988 and 2012 [57]), and questions have been raised about its ability to cause gastrointestinal disease in humans.\n【14】 Photobacterium damselae — P. damselae has gone through several name changes: originally designated as V. damsela (based on its pathogenicity for damsel fish [65]), it has been known as Listonella damsela, and is currently designated as P. damselae subspecies damselae. It is pathogenic for fish and other marine organisms, including cetaceans [66]; strains have been associated with unusual mortality events in striped dolphins [67]. While the number of reported human cases in the United States is relatively low (table 1), P. damselae is a recognized cause of wound infections after exposure to marine or estuarine waters [52]. Bacteremia has been reported in association with wound infections, and there are reports of isolation from patients with necrotizing fasciitis [68,69].\n【15】 DIAGNOSIS — The diagnosis of these Vibrio species is established by isolation of the organism from the relevant clinical specimen, generally stool or wound specimens, as well as blood. They can grow on standard media used for wound and blood cultures. Isolation of Vibrio species from stool generally requires a selective media to suppress growth of other organisms, such as thiosulfate, citrate, bile salts, and sucrose (TCBS). The laboratory should be alerted regarding cases of diarrhea in which illness due to Vibrio species is suspected so that the appropriate media can be used.\n【16】 TREATMENT\n【17】 Diarrheal disease — Volume repletion is the most important element of therapy in patients with diarrheal disease and is best done through the oral route with solutions that contain water, salt, and sugar. (See  \"Approach to the adult with acute diarrhea in resource-rich settings\", section on 'Fluid repletion'.)\n【18】 Wound infection — There are few data on treatment of wound infections due to these Vibrio species. Treatment suggestions are based upon clinical experience. Serious wound infections generally require debridement and antimicrobial therapy. Mild wound infections generally respond well to local wound care and oral antibiotics. In the case of V. alginolyticus infections of superficial wounds, antibiotics may not be necessary, as reflected by the report from Australia in which most cases resolved spontaneously [61]. Based upon antibiotic susceptibility patterns and clinical response of other Vibrio species, we suggest doxycycline, a fluoroquinolone, or azithromycin for severe wound infections and infections in immunocompromised hosts. Susceptibility testing should be done to confirm sensitivity to these agents. We typically use oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily, or azithromycin 500 mg on day 1 followed by 250 mg once daily. Duration of therapy is dictated by clinical response; most patients respond to five to seven days of antibiotics.\n【19】 SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

If ovaries are abnormally enlarged on the last day of follitropin alfa treatment, follow current clinical practice to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).\n【41】 • Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: OHSS is a rare, exaggerated response to ovulation induction therapy (Corbett 2014; Fiedler 2012). This syndrome may begin within 24 hours of human chorionic gonadotropin treatment but may become most severe 7 to 10 days after therapy (Corbett 2014). Mild/moderate OHSS signs/symptoms may include abdominal distention/discomfort, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and mild/moderate enlargement of ovaries/ovarian cysts. Severe OHSS signs/symptoms may include severe abdominal pain, anuria/oliguria, ascites, severe dyspnea, hypotension, hydrothorax, nausea/vomiting (intractable), pleural effusion, rapid weight gain, venous thrombosis, and large ovarian cysts. Decreased CrCl, hemoconcentration, hypoproteinemia, elevated liver enzymes, elevated WBC, and electrolyte imbalances may also be present (ASRM 2016; Corbett 2014; Fiedler 2012). Treatment is primarily symptomatic and includes fluid and electrolyte management, analgesics, and prevention of thromboembolic complications (ASRM 2016; Shmorgun 2017).\n【42】 • Ovarian torsion: Has been reported following gonadotropin treatment; may be related to OHSS, prior ovarian torsion, prior or current ovarian cyst, polycystic ovaries, pregnancy, or prior abdominal surgery. Early diagnosis and prompt detorsion may limit the extent of ovarian damage.\n【43】 • Pulmonary effects: Serious pulmonary conditions (atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and exacerbation of asthma) have been reported.\n【44】 • Thromboembolic events: In association with and separate from OHSS, thromboembolic events have been reported. Risk may be increased in patients with severe obesity, thrombophilia, or a personal or family history of risk factors for thrombosis.\n【45】 • Multiple-dose injection pens: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pen-shaped injection devices should never be used for more than one person (even when the needle is changed) because of the risk of infection. The injection device should be clearly labeled with individual patient information to ensure that the correct pen is used (CDC 2012).\n【46】 • Appropriate use: To minimize risks, use only at the lowest effective dose. Monitor ovarian response with transvaginal ultrasound; concurrent measurement of estradiol levels may also be useful.\n【47】 • Experienced physician: These medications should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management.\n【48】 • Multiple births: May result from the use of these medications; advise patient of the potential risk of multiple births before starting the treatment.\n【49】 Dosage Forms Considerations\n【50】 Gonal-f 450 unit and 1050 unit multi-dose vials are packaged with a diluent (bacteriostatic water for injection in a prefilled syringe) that contains benzyl alcohol.\n【51】 Dosage Forms: US\n【52】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【53】 Solution Pen-injector, Subcutaneous:\n【54】 Gonal-f RFF Rediject: 300 units/0.5 mL (0.5 mL); 450 units/0.75 mL (0.75 mL); 900 units/1.5 mL (1.5 mL) [contains metacresol]\n【55】 Solution Reconstituted, Injection:\n【56】 Gonal-f: 450 units (1 ea); 1050 units (1 ea) [contains benzyl alcohol]\n【57】 Solution Reconstituted, Subcutaneous:\n【58】 Gonal-f RFF: 75 units (1 ea)\n【59】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【60】 No\n【61】 Pricing: US\n【62】 450 unit (per each): $1,738.87\n【63】 1050 unit (per each): $4,057.37\n【64】 75 unit (per each): $289.81\n【65】 300 units/0.5 mL (per 0.5 mL): $1,159.25\n【66】 450 unit/0.75 mL (per 0.75 mL): $1,738.87\n【67】 900 unit/1.5 mL (per mL): $2,318.49\n【68】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【69】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Evaluate current pregnancy status as well as the fertility of the male partner prior to treatment.\n【82】 When used for the induction of spermatogenesis, exclude primary testicular failure and normalize testosterone levels prior to treatment. Evaluate fertility status of the female partner prior to induction of spermatogenesis when treating males with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (AACE [Petak 2002]).\n【83】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【84】 Follitropin alfa is used in the management of patients who wish to become pregnant; use is not indicated for patients who are already pregnant.\n【85】 Ectopic pregnancy, congenital abnormalities, spontaneous abortion, and multiple births have been reported. The incidence of congenital abnormality may be slightly higher after in vitro fertilization or intracytoplasmic sperm injection than with spontaneous conception. The higher incidence of congenital abnormalities and spontaneous abortion may be related to parenteral characteristics (maternal age, sperm characteristics) and not specifically associated with gonadotropin use.\n【86】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【87】 It is not known if follitropin alfa is present in breast milk.\n【88】 Prolactin secretion during lactation may lead to inadequate ovarian stimulation; therefore, breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer.\n【89】 Monitoring Parameters\n【90】 Monitor follicular growth by transvaginal ultrasound to determine adequate ovarian response and timing of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration. Concurrent measurement of estradiol levels may also be useful.\n【91】 Monitor for signs and symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) for at least 2 weeks following hCG administration. Initial symptoms of moderate to severe OHSS may include a sensation of bloating, abdominal pain, rapid weight gain, and decreased urine output (Shmorgun 2017).\n【92】 OHSS: Monitoring of hospitalized patients should include albumin, degree of ascites, cardiorespiratory status, electrolytes, fluid balance, hematocrit, hemoglobin, hydration, serum creatinine, urine output, urine-specific gravity, signs of thromboembolism, vital signs, weight (daily or as necessary), and liver enzymes (weekly) (Shmorgun 2017).\n【93】 Spermatogenesis: Monitor serum testosterone levels, sperm count.\n【94】 Mechanism of Action\n【95】 Follitropin alfa is a human FSH preparation of recombinant DNA origin. Follitropins stimulate ovarian follicular growth in women who do not have primary ovarian failure, and stimulate spermatogenesis in men with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. FSH is required for normal follicular growth, maturation, gonadal steroid production, and spermatogenesis.\n【96】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【97】 Onset of action: Peak effect:\n【98】 Spermatogenesis, median: 6.8-12.4 months (range 2.7-18.1 months)\n【99】 Follicle development: Within cycle\n【100】 Absorption: SubQ: Absorption rate is slower than the elimination rate\n【101】 Distribution: Mean Vd: 0.7 L with in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer patients\n【102】 Bioavailability: ~66% to 76% in healthy female volunteers; 10% in in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer patients\n【103】 Half-life elimination:\n【104】 SubQ: 24-53 hours in healthy female volunteers; 32-41 hours in healthy male volunteers\n【105】 Time to peak: In healthy volunteers:\n【106】 Females: SubQ: 8-16 hours\n【107】 Males: SubQ: 11-20 hours\n【108】 Excretion: Clearance: IV: 0.6 L/hour in healthy female volunteers\n【109】 Brand Names: International\n【110】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Follitropin alfa (recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone)  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/follitropin-alfa-recombinant-human-follicle-stimulating-hormone-drug-information?search=%E8%82%BA%E4%B8%8D%E8%82%B2%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A2%E5%AD%90%E8%8F%8C%E7%97%85&source=search_result&selectedTitle=95%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": 1864, "text": "url: http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/airway-management-for-anesthesia-for-the-patient-with-a-tracheostomy?search=%E5%85%B7%E6%9C%89%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E8%A3%85%E7%BD%AE&source=search_result&selectedTitle=50%7E150&usage_type=default\n【0】 Airway management for anesthesia for the patient with a tracheostomy\n【1】 ●(See  \"Tracheostomy: Rationale, indications, and contraindications\".)\n【2】 ●(See  \"Tracheostomy in adults: Techniques and intraoperative complications\".)\n【3】 ●(See  \"Tracheostomy: Postoperative care, maintenance, and complications in adults\".)\n【4】 ●Preventing complications associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation\n【5】 ●Long term ventilation and airway protection in patients with advanced chronic degenerative neurological or neuromuscular conditions\n【6】 ●Securing the airway in patients with acute or chronic upper airway obstruction (eg, patients with obstructive sleep apnea refractory to other therapies)\n【7】 ●Airway management in patients undergoing major head and neck surgery (including laryngectomy) or some face or neck fractures\n【8】 ●Size – The size of tracheostomy tubes is commonly labeled according to the internal diameter (ID) expressed in millimeters [8], (eg, a size 7 tube has an internal diameter of 7 mm). For dual cannula tubes the size refers to the internal diameter of the outer cannula. Importantly, dimensions of tracheostomy tubes for a given size are not standardized across manufacturers, and may not be the same as the same size tracheal tube. The internal and external diameters are printed on the flange of the tracheostomy tube, and are also printed on tracheal tubes (picture 3).\n【9】 ●Inflatable cuff – Inflatable cuffs are necessary for patients who require positive pressure ventilation. Not all tracheostomy tubes have cuffs.\n【10】 Some tracheostomy tubes meant for chronic use have a “tight to shaft” cuff, which contracts around the shaft of the tube when not inflated (picture 4). These are high pressure, low volume cuffs, and are not used for patients who require the cuff inflated for most of the day.\n【11】 Tight to shaft tracheostomy tubes may be used for positive pressure ventilation during short procedures but should be used cautiously for longer anesthetics to avoid injury of the tracheal mucosa. For some of these tubes (eg, the Bivona Tight to Shaft tube), the cuff must be filled with water rather than air, because air leaks out of the cuff over time. As these are low-volume high-pressure cuffs, the measured cuff pressure does not reflect the pressure exerted by the cuff on the tracheal mucosa. Thus, minimal occlusive volume should be used to prevent tracheal mucosal ischemia if the tube is used for longer anesthetics.\n【12】 ●Fenestration – Fenestrated tubes allow breathing and phonation through the vocal cords, even with the cuff inflated. They are rarely used because of a high incidence of granulation tissue (picture 5).\n【13】 ●Single versus dual cannula – Some tracheostomy tubes consist of two cannulae; the inner cannula is a tube of smaller diameter designed to fit closely inside the outer cannula. A locking mechanism secures the two cannulae together (picture 2). The inner cannula can be removed for cleaning without having to remove the outer tube from the stoma. Importantly, the standard 15 mm connector for ventilation devices may be part of either the inner or outer cannula, depending on the tube in place. Airway resistance will be higher during ventilation through the smaller inner cannula. Both single and dual cannula tracheostomy tubes are available in cuffed and uncuffed versions.\n【14】 ●Obturator – The obturator is used to insert the tracheostomy tube (picture 2).\n【15】 ●Speaking valve – Speaking valves must be removed before using positive pressure ventilation during anesthesia [9]. The Passy-Muir Valve, a one-way speaking and swallowing valve, is a small device that is attached to the 15 mm connector. The valve opens only during inspiration and prohibits exhalation through the tube. Thus, air is exhaled around the tube and through the vocal cords to allow phonation. Importantly, this type of valve must only be used with either an uncuffed tube, or with the cuff deflated on a cuffed tube, to allow exhalation (figure 1).\n【16】 ●T-tube – A t-tube is a device that combines an uncuffed tracheostomy tube with a tracheal stent. T-tubes are sometimes referred to as Montgomery tubes or Montgomery t-tubes, since the Montgomery tube was the first one described (figure 2).\n【17】 There is a tracheal limb, open on both ends, connected to a perpendicular extratracheal limb that extends through the tracheostomy stoma (figure 2) [10,11]. T-tubes may be used for treatment of subglottic or tracheal stenosis in patients for whom surgical repair is not an option [12]. They are available in various sizes ranging from 4.5 to 16 mm external diameter for the tracheal limb, and 4.5 to 11 mm for the extratracheal limb [13]. (See  \"Management of non-life-threatening, nonmalignant subglottic and tracheal stenosis in adults\", section on 'Tracheostomy or T-tube'.)\n【18】 Options for ventilation in the patient with a t-tube in place are discussed below. (See 'Airway management in patients with t-tubes' below.)\n【19】 ●Tracheostomy button (plug or retainer) – These devices may be placed to keep the tracheostomy stoma open after decannulation, often during a prolonged post-tracheostomy observation period (figure 3). Tracheostomy buttons must be exchanged for cuffed tracheal tubes for positive pressure ventilation during anesthesia.\n【20】 ●Laryngectomy tube – Laryngectomy tubes are used to maintain the opening of the stoma. They have no connectors for ventilation devices, and must be exchanged for a cuffed tube for positive pressure ventilation.\n【21】 ●If it is likely that airway management from above would be possible if the tracheostomy tube becomes dislodged or cannot be reinserted during exchange, the first approach for airway rescue should be mask ventilation, placement of an SGA, or oral intubation, as appropriate.\n【22】 ●For patients with a recently placed tracheostomy in whom airway management from above is not feasible, tube exchange should be avoided, and if absolutely necessary, a surgeon should be present for the exchange.\n【23】 ●Patients with a mature tracheostomy tract – For most patients with a mature tracheostomy who will be positioned prone or lateral or who will be repositioned during surgery, we change the tracheostomy tube to a wire reinforced tracheal tube, whether the tracheostomy tube is cuffed or uncuffed. Reinforced tubes are flexible and resist kinking.\n【24】 ●Patients with immature tracheostomy tract – For patients with recently placed tracheostomy tubes (ie ≤7 days) who will be positioned prone, lateral, or repositioned during the procedure, or in whom there will not be easy access to the tracheostomy tube during surgery, we balance the risk of complications associated with tube exchange versus possible tube dislodgement in the planned position when deciding whether to exchange the tube.\n【25】 ●Standard uncuffed tubes – The tracheostomy tube should be replaced prior to general anesthesia for most patients with an uncuffed or fenestrated tube in place. For patients with uncuffed tracheostomy tubes undergoing procedures in the supine position that can be performed with intravenous sedation or anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation (eg, some endoscopic gastrointestinal procedures, some cystoscopies, selected interventional radiology or electrophysiology procedures), the procedure can be started without exchanging the tracheostomy tube. If oxygenation or ventilation becomes inadequate the uncuffed tracheostomy tube should be exchanged for a cuffed tracheal tube.\n【26】 Patients with uncuffed tubes who have procedures with local or regional anesthesia with no or minimal sedation and who are breathing spontaneously through the tube generally do not require tube exchange prior to the procedure.\n【27】 ●T-tube – For patients with a t-tube (which is a special type of uncuffed tube), replacing the tube is avoided if possible. If replacement is necessary, a surgeon with expertise in managing t-tubes should be consulted. Replacing the tube may be necessary for patients who require high airway pressure for ventilation (eg, during laparoscopic procedures in obese patients), or when insertion of a supraglottic airway would interfere with the procedure (eg, during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy), or when the patient is positioned prone. Management of the airway in patients with a t-tube is discussed below. (See 'Airway management in patients with t-tubes' below.)\n【28】 ●Patients with chronic tracheostomy – For patients with chronic tracheostomies who self-remove and reposition the tracheostomy tube periodically for cleaning or replacement, we perform the tube exchange under light sedation/analgesia as necessary, spontaneous ventilation, and topical 4% lidocaine.\n【29】 ●Patients with recent tracheostomy – Patients with immature tracheostomy tracts usually have a cuffed tracheostomy tube in place when they come to the operating room. For these patients we usually exchange the tube after induction of anesthesia and administration of neuromuscular blocking agents, to prevent coughing and to facilitate rescue airway maneuvers in case of difficult or failed tube exchange.\n【30】 ●Preoxygenate the patient with 100% oxygen until the expired oxygen concentration is greater than 90%.\n【31】 ●Select a wire reinforced cuffed tracheal tube similar in diameter to the tracheostomy tube. Have tracheal tubes with two sizes lower than the selected tube (0.5 and 1 mm diameter smaller) as backup.\n【32】 ●Deflate the tracheostomy tube cuff if necessary, remove the tube and set it aside for replacement at the end of the procedure.\n【33】 ●Insert the tracheal tube into the stoma, aimed caudad, in an oblique angle in relation to the neck surface and with the convex curve of the tube facing the patient’s head.\n【34】 ●Insert the tube just until the proximal border of the tube cuff passes all the way through the tracheostomy tract, to minimize the risk of mainstem intubation. The distance from the tracheal stoma to the carina is usually 5 to 7 cm (longer in taller patients) [18-20], and the distance from the proximal edge of the tracheal tube cuff to the tube tip varies with the size of the tube. For example, this distance is approximately 5.5 cm in a size 7.0 tracheal tube, but only 4 cm in a size 5.0 tube. Thus, there is higher risk of mainstem intubation with larger tracheal tubes. In most patients the length of the tracheostomy tract is approximately 2.5 cm, though it may be much longer in obese patients.\n【35】 ●Use a permanent marker to draw a mark on the tube at the level of the skin to determine whether the tube depth changes during the procedure.\n【36】 ●Inflate the cuff, set the cuff pressure to 20 to 30 cm H2O with a manometer, ventilate, and confirm bilateral breath sounds and end tidal CO2. If there is any question about the tube position, confirm correct placement above the carina with a flexible intubating scope.\n【37】 ●Preoxygenation can usually be achieved by attaching the anesthesia breathing circuit to an existing tracheostomy tube, whether it is cuffed or not.\n【38】 ●Patients with capped tracheostomy tubes who are breathing spontaneously through the mouth or nose can be preoxygenated by facemask.\n【39】 ●Patients with a total laryngectomy can be preoxygenated with a pediatric facemask or soft supraglottic airway held over the stoma. Positive pressure ventilation is often possible with one of these devices with a tight seal.\n【40】 ●Patients with cuffed tracheostomy tubes\n【41】 ●Patients with uncuffed tracheostomy tubes – We perform IV induction for these patients because the gas leak around the tube makes inhalation induction inefficient and contaminates the operating room with anesthetic gas.\n【42】 ●Patients who had an uncuffed tracheostomy tube exchanged for a cuffed tracheal tube:\n【43】 ●Patients who had a cuffed tracheostomy tube exchanged for a cuffed tracheal tube:\n【44】 ●Ventilate through the horizontal limb of the t-tube:\n【45】 And\n【46】 ●Ventilate with a supraglottic airway – Insert a supraglottic airway (SGA) and cap or plug the horizontal limb of the t-tube. Two options for positive pressure ventilation with an SGA in the patient with a t-tube in place are shown in a figure (figure 4). With this technique a large leak may occur around the SGA during positive pressure ventilation, because of the high resistance to airflow in patients with subglottic or tracheal stenosis.\n【47】 ●Insert a cuffed tracheal tube into the tracheal limb of the t-tube – This can be done by inserting a size 4.0 or 4.5 tracheal tube through the horizontal limb into the caudal portion, or by inserting such a tube from above using direct laryngoscopy [25]. This technique may not be possible in patients with small t-tubes. Flow resistance will be high through such a small tracheal tube, and there may be significant leak around the t-tube.\n【48】 ●Use jet ventilation – Position a rigid bronchoscope proximal to the cephalad end of the t-tube in the glottic/subglottic area and use jet ventilation [12]. This approach is not practical because it requires continuous use of a suspension laryngoscope or bronchoscope, and because oxygenation and ventilation are less efficient with jet ventilation than with conventional ventilation.\n【49】 ●The first step in diagnosing and managing possible obstruction is to pass a suction catheter through the tube into the trachea. The catheter should easily advance beyond the tip of the tracheostomy tube, and any obstructing material should be suctioned out.\n【50】 ●If there is resistance to passing the suction catheter, tube dislodgement should be suspected.\n【51】 ●It is reasonable to deflate the cuff and attempt to gently reposition the tube. If ventilation remains ineffective, follow management for dislodged tracheostomy tube below.\n【52】 ●Call for help and emergency advanced airway equipment, including a flexible intubating scope.\n【53】 ●Prioritize oxygenation throughout the event.\n【54】 ●Attempt ventilation:\n【55】 ●For patients with a tracheostomy placed <7 days prior – Attempt oral intubation if feasible. If oral intubation is not possible, use a flexible intubating scope (preferred) or bougie to insert a tracheal tube through the tracheostomy stoma.\n【56】 ●For patients with tracheostomy placed ≥7 days prior – Insert a tracheal tube into the tracheostomy stoma.\n【57】 ●If attempts fail, insert a cricothyrotomy catheter into the trachea in the distal trachea at the level of the sternal notch, and start jet ventilation while waiting for a surgical airway to be established.\n【58】 ●Residual tracheostomy tract or fistula – In patients who have been recently decannulated or who have a residual tracheostomy fistula, gas leak through the fistula may occur during ventilation by mask or with a supraglottic airway. Applying pressure with a gauze pad to the residual tracheostomy tract usually suffices to achieve efficient mask ventilation until the airway is secured with a cuffed tracheal tube.\n【59】 ●Patients with tracheal or subglottic stenosis – Tracheal stenosis is a relatively common complication of tracheostomy. (See  \"Tracheostomy: Postoperative care, maintenance, and complications in adults\", section on 'Tracheal and stoma stenosis'.)\n【60】 For patients with mild tracheal stenosis, airway management may be straightforward, though difficult airway equipment and small size tracheal tubes should be immediately available during induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia for patients with severe tracheal stenosis is discussed in detail separately. (See  \"Anesthesia for tracheal surgery: General considerations\" and  \"Anesthesia for tracheal surgery: Specific procedures\".)\n【61】 ●Preanesthesia assessment – Assessment should include determining the indication for tracheostomy, when the tracheostomy was placed (ie, in the past seven days), existing airway anatomy, and the type of tracheostomy tube in place (eg, cuffed versus uncuffed). (table 1) (See 'Preanesthesia assessment' above.)\n【62】 ●Plan for airway management – The plan for airway management should be determined by the following issues (algorithm 1) (see 'Creating a plan for airway management' above):\n【63】 ●Tracheostomy tube exchange – Tracheostomy tubes can be exchanged prior to induction of anesthesia in patients with chronic tracheostomies. For other patients we usually exchange the tube after induction and paralysis to prevent coughing and to facilitate airway management in case of difficult tube exchange. The technique for tube exchange is described above. (See 'Tube exchange' above.)\n【64】 ●Tracheostomy tube re-exchange – For patients who had a tracheostomy tube exchanged for anesthesia, the tube should be exchanged back to the original type of tube while the patient is still in the operating room anesthetized. (See 'Emergence from anesthesia' above.)\n【65】 ●Airway management in patients with t-tubes – For effective ventilation in patients with t-tubes in place, the breathing circuit must be connected to the extratracheal limb (which has no standard connector), and the upper airway or the cranial portion of the tracheal limb must be sealed. (figure 4)(See 'Airway management in patients with t-tubes' above.)\n【66】 ●Tracheostomy emergencies – Inability to ventilate through a tracheostomy tube may be due to tube obstruction or displacement of the tube. Management of a displaced tracheostomy tube during anesthesia is shown in an algorithm (algorithm 2).

Do not use when peristalsis inhibition should be avoided due to potential for ileus, megacolon and/or toxic megacolon.\n【35】 • Torsades de pointes and sudden death: [US Boxed Warning]: Cases of torsades de pointes, cardiac arrest, and death have been reported with the use of a higher than recommended dosage. Contraindicated in pediatric patients <2 years. Avoid dosages higher than recommended in patients ≥2 years due to the risk of serious cardiac adverse reactions. Cases of syncope and ventricular tachycardia have been reported in adults receiving the recommended dose of loperamide. Cases of cardiac arrest, syncope, and respiratory depression have been reported in pediatric patients <2 years. Avoid use in patients with risk factors for QT prolongation (eg, congenital long QT syndrome, history of cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac conditions, elderly, electrolyte abnormalities) and in combination with others drugs known to prolong the QT interval.\n【36】 • AIDS: Stop therapy at the first sign of abdominal distention; cases of toxic megacolon have occurred in patients with AIDS and infectious colitis (due to viral or bacterial pathogens).\n【37】 • Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment due to reduced first-pass metabolism; monitor for signs of CNS toxicity.\n【38】 • Older adult: Use with caution in elderly patients; may be more susceptible to drug-associated effects on the QT interval.\n【39】 • Pediatric: OTC use is contraindicated in patients <2 years of age due to risks of respiratory depression or cardiac adverse events. Response to loperamide may be variable in pediatric patients due to increased risk of dehydration secondary to diarrhea; use with caution.\n【40】 • Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP [\"Inactive\" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.\n【41】 • Appropriate use: Loperamide is a symptom-directed treatment; if an underlying diagnosis is made, other disease-specific treatment may be indicated. Concurrent fluid and electrolyte replacement is often necessary in all age groups depending upon severity of diarrhea.\n【42】 • Duration of use: If diarrhea lasts longer than 2 days, symptoms worsen, or abdominal swelling or bulging develops, discontinue use and consult healthcare provider.\n【43】 • Self medication (OTC use): Consult health care provider prior to using, if taking antibiotics, if pregnant or breastfeeding, or in the presence of fever, mucus in stool, or a history of liver disease. Serious heart problems may occur if taken more than directed.\n【44】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【45】 When managing acute dysentery, concurrent fluid and electrolyte replacement is often necessary in all age groups depending upon severity of diarrhea; young pediatric patients are particularly susceptible to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Antidiarrheal agents are not recommended as part of the management of acute gastroenteritis in infants and children due to risk of serious adverse events (CDC 2003; Red Book [AAP 2021]). A meta-analysis evaluating the use of loperamide for adjunct treatment of acute bacterial gastroenteritis in pediatric patients identified that infants and children who are <3 years of age, malnourished, or moderately to severely dehydrated, or those with bloody diarrhea have a higher risk of serious adverse events (ileus, lethargy, death) even at therapeutic doses (≤0.25 mg/kg/day of loperamide); the potential benefit of loperamide therapy does not outweigh risks; use should be avoided in pediatric patients (IDSA [Shane 2017]; Li 2007). Although data suggest that older children with milder infection and adolescents may see benefit from loperamide therapy, including decreased duration of diarrhea and stool counts, use is not recommended (IDSA [Shane 2017]); if used, patients should be monitored closely for adverse effects or worsening of infection (CDC 2003; Li 2007).\n【46】 Although OTC use is contraindicated in ages <2 years, loperamide may be necessary in young pediatric patients with intestinal failure or short-bowel syndrome (Buts 1975; Ching 2007; Sandhu 1983). Response to loperamide may be variable in pediatric patients due to increased risk of dehydration secondary to diarrhea; use with caution and monitor for adverse effects.\n【47】 Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; in neonates, large amounts of propylene glycol delivered orally, intravenously (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically have been associated with potentially fatal toxicities which can include metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, and CNS depression; toxicities have also been reported in children and adults including hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Shehab 2009).\n【48】 Dosage Forms: US\n【49】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Management: Monitor for QTc interval prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias when these agents are combined. Patients with additional risk factors for QTc prolongation may be at even higher risk. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【96】 Lonafarnib: May increase the serum concentration of Loperamide. Management: When first using loperamide with lonafarnib, do not exceed a loperamide dose of 1 mg/day. If needed, the loperamide dose can then be slowly and cautiously increased according to the loperamide labeling. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【97】 QT-prolonging Agents (Highest Risk): QT-prolonging Agents (Indeterminate Risk - Avoid) may enhance the QTc-prolonging effect of QT-prolonging Agents (Highest Risk).

Management: Consider discontinuing drugs that may affect gallbladder motility prior to the use of sincalide to stimulate gallbladder contraction. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【102】 Dietary Considerations\n【103】 Some products may contain sodium.\n【104】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【105】 Adverse effects have not been observed in animal reproduction studies. Information related to loperamide use in pregnancy is limited and data are conflicting (Einarson 2000; Källén 2008). For acute diarrhea in pregnant women, some clinicians recommend oral rehydration and dietary changes; loperamide in small amounts may be used only if symptoms are disabling (Wald 2003).\n【106】 Monitoring Parameters\n【107】 Stool output, CNS toxicity assessment, respiratory and cardiac status (particularly in very young pediatric patients).\n【108】 Mechanism of Action\n【109】 Acts directly on circular and longitudinal intestinal muscles, through the opioid receptor, to inhibit peristalsis and prolong transit time; reduces fecal volume, increases viscosity, and diminishes fluid and electrolyte loss; demonstrates antisecretory activity.

Reactions reported from monotherapy and combination therapy.\n【17】 >10%:\n【18】 Endocrine & metabolic: Hypoglycemia (combination therapy; 3% to 17%)\n【19】 Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea (13%), nausea (11%)\n【20】 Local: Injection site reaction (11% to 18%, including erythema at injection site [2%], hypersensitivity reaction at injection site [1%], rash at injection site [1%], itching at injection site)\n【21】 Respiratory: Upper respiratory tract infection (14%)\n【22】 1% to 10%:\n【23】 Cardiovascular: Atrial fibrillation (1%)\n【24】 Endocrine & metabolic: Increased gamma-glutamyl transferase (2%)\n【25】 Gastrointestinal: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (4%), vomiting (4%)\n【26】 Immunologic: Antibody development (non-neutralizing; 6%)\n【27】 Infection: Influenza (5%)\n【28】 Neuromuscular & skeletal: Arthralgia (7%), back pain (7%)\n【29】 Respiratory: Cough (7%), pneumonia (2%)\n【30】 <1%: Angioedema, appendicitis, atrial flutter, constipation, hypersensitivity reaction, increased heart rate (1-2 bpm), increased serum ALT, increased serum bilirubin, pancreatitis\n【31】 Contraindications\n【32】 Prior serious hypersensitivity (eg, angioedema) to albiglutide or any component of the formulation; history of or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC); patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2)\n【33】 Warnings/Precautions\n【34】 • Hypersensitivity reactions: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (including angioedema, generalized pruritus and rash with dyspnea) have been reported with use; discontinue therapy in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction; treat appropriately and monitor patients until signs and symptoms resolve. Use in patients with prior serious hypersensitivity reactions to albiglutide is contraindicated. Use with caution in patients with history of anaphylaxis or angioedema to other GLP-1 receptor agonists; potential for cross-sensitivity is unknown.\n【35】 • Gallbladder disease: Use of GLP-1 agonists may increase risk of gallbladder and bile duct disease (Faillie 2016).\n【36】 • Pancreatitis: Cases of acute pancreatitis have been reported; monitor for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (eg, persistent severe abdominal pain which may radiate to the back and which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue use. Do not resume unless an alternative etiology of pancreatitis is confirmed. Consider antidiabetic therapies other than albiglutide in patients with a history of pancreatitis.\n【37】 • Renal effects: Worsening renal failure and acute kidney injury (some requiring hemodialysis) have been reported; some cases have been reported in patients with no known preexisting renal disease and without gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Monitor for dehydration associated with gastrointestinal effects and avoid fluid depletion.\n【38】 • Thyroid tumors: [US Boxed Warning] Thyroid C-cell tumors have developed in animal studies with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists; it is not known if albiglutide causes thyroid C-cell tumor, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in humans. Routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound monitoring is of uncertain value for early detection of MTC in patients treated with albiglutide. Patients should be counseled on the potential risk of MTC with the use of albiglutide and informed of symptoms of thyroid tumors (eg, neck mass, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Use is contraindicated in patients with a personal or a family history of MTC and in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2). Cases of MTC in humans have been reported in patients treated with the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide. Consultation with an endocrinologist is recommended in patients with thyroid nodules on physical examination or neck imaging and patients who develop elevated calcitonin concentrations.\n【39】 • Bariatric surgery:\n【40】 ­ - Dehydration: Evaluate, correct, and maintain postsurgical fluid requirements and volume status prior to initiating therapy, and closely monitor the patient for the duration of therapy; acute and chronic kidney failure exacerbation may occur. A majority of cases occurred in patients with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or dehydration. Nausea is common and fluid intake may be more difficult after gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and gastric band (Mechanick 2020).\n【41】 ­ - Excessive glucagon-like peptide-1 exposure: Closely monitor for efficacy and assess for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis if therapy is initiated after surgery; gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy (but not gastric band) significantly increase endogenous postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentrations (Korner 2009; Peterli 2012). Administration of exogenous GLP-1 agonists may be redundant to surgery effects.\n【42】 • Gastrointestinal disease: Use is not recommended in patients with preexisting severe gastrointestinal disease.\n【43】 • Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment and/or in patients with severe GI symptoms, particularly during initiation of therapy and dose escalation.\n【44】 • Appropriate use: Diabetes mellitus: Not recommended for first-line therapy in patients inadequately controlled on diet and exercise alone. Do not use in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis; not a substitute for insulin.\n【45】 • Patient education: Diabetes self-management education (DSME) is essential to maximize the effectiveness of therapy.\n【46】 Product Availability\n【47】 Tanzeum has been discontinued in the US for >1 year.\n【48】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【49】 No\n【50】 Pricing: US\n【51】 30 mg (per each): $156.60\n【52】 50 mg (per each): $156.60\n【53】 Administration: Adult\n【54】 SubQ: Do not inject intravenously or intramuscularly.

Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【90】 Thiazide and Thiazide-Like Diuretics: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Antidiabetic Agents. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【91】 Reproductive Considerations\n【92】 Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are not recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus planning to become pregnant. Patients who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy. Transition to a preferred therapy should be initiated prior to conception and contraception should be continued until glycemic control is achieved (ADA 2021; Alexopoulos 2019; Egan 2020)\n【93】 Because of the long washout period, consider stopping albiglutide at least 1 month before a planned pregnancy.\n【94】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【95】 Adverse events have been observed in some animal reproduction studies.\n【96】 Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, delivery complications, major malformations, stillbirth, and macrosomia (ACOG 201 2018). To prevent adverse outcomes, prior to conception and throughout pregnancy, maternal blood glucose and HbA1c should be kept as close to target goals as possible but without causing significant hypoglycemia (ADA 2021; Blumer 2013).\n【97】 Agents other than albiglutide are currently recommended to treat diabetes mellitus in pregnancy (ADA 2021).\n【98】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【99】 It is not known if albiglutide is present in breast milk. The manufacturer recommends a decision be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of treatment to the mother.\n【100】 Dietary Considerations\n【101】 Individualized medical nutrition therapy (MNT) based on ADA recommendations is an integral part of therapy.\n【102】 Monitoring Parameters\n【103】 Plasma glucose; renal function; signs/symptoms of pancreatitis; signs/symptoms of gallbladder disease; signs/symptoms of dehydration.\n【104】 Reference Range\n【105】 HbA1c: <7% (a more aggressive [<6.5%] or less aggressive [<8%] HbA1c goal may be targeted based on patient-specific characteristics). Note\n【106】 : In patients using a continuous glucose monitoring system, a goal of time in range >70% with time below range <4% is recommended and is similar to a goal HbA1c <7%.\n【107】 Preprandial capillary blood glucose: 80 to 130 mg/dL (SI: 4.4 to 7.2 mmol/L) (more or less stringent goals may be appropriate based on patient-specific characteristics).\n【108】 Peak postprandial capillary blood glucose (~1 to 2 hours after a meal): <180 mg/dL (SI: <10 mmol/L) (more or less stringent goals may be appropriate based on patient-specific characteristics).\n【109】 HbA1c: <7% to 7.5% (healthy); <8% to 8.5% (complex/intermediate health). Note: Individualization may be appropriate based on patient and caregiver preferences and/or presence of cognitive impairment. In patients with very complex or poor health (ie, limited remaining life expectancy), consider making therapy decisions based on avoidance of hypoglycemia and symptomatic hyperglycemia rather than HbA1c level.\n【110】 Preprandial capillary blood glucose: 80 to 130 mg/dL (SI: 4.4 to 7.2 mmol/L) (healthy); 90 to 150 mg/dL (SI: 5 to 8.3 mmol/L) (complex/intermediate health); 100 to 180 mg/dL (SI: 5.6 to 10 mmol/L) (very complex/poor health).\n【111】 Bedtime capillary blood glucose: 80 to 180 mg/dL (SI: 4.4 to 10 mmol/L) (healthy); 100 to 180 mg/dL (SI: 5.6 to 10 mmol/L) (complex/intermediate health); 110 to 200 mg/dL (SI: 6.1 to 11.1 mmol/L) (very complex/poor health).\n【112】 Level 1: 54 to 70 mg/dL (SI: 3 to 3.9 mmol/L); hypoglycemia alert value; initiate fast-acting carbohydrate (eg, glucose) treatment.\n【113】 Level 2: <54 mg/dL (SI: <3 mmol/L); threshold for neuroglycopenic symptoms; requires immediate action.\n【114】 Level 3: Hypoglycemia associated with a severe event characterized by altered mental and/or physical status requiring assistance.\n【115】 Mechanism of Action\n【116】 Albiglutide is an agonist of human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor and augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion and slows gastric emptying.\n【117】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【118】 Distribution: Vd: 11 L\n【119】 Metabolism: Degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids by proteolytic enzymes.\n【120】 Half-life elimination: ~5 days\n【121】 Time to peak, plasma: 3 to 5 days\n【122】 Brand Names: International\n【123】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Albiglutide (United States  Not available)  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/albiglutide-united-states-not-available-drug-information?search=%E5%A6%8A%E5%A8%A0%E6%9C%9F%E5%8E%9F%E6%9C%89%E7%9A%842%E5%9E%8B%E7%B3%96%E5%B0%BF%E7%97%85&source=search_result&selectedTitle=95%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

The approach to acute knee pain in these patients and the evaluation of children with joint pain or swelling are discussed separately. (See  \"Approach to acute knee pain and injury in children and skeletally immature adolescents\" and  \"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling\".)\n【2】 DEFINITIONS\n【3】 Chronic injury — In children and skeletally immature adolescents, chronic injury can arise from any of the following situations:\n【4】 ●An acute injury that does not heal properly (eg, an anterior cruciate ligament tear that is not fully rehabilitated or in which surgical repair fails)\n【5】 ●Insidious onset of pain without specific injury related to excessive activity that is beyond the body's ability to accommodate (eg, iliotibial band syndrome in a soccer player or runner)\n【6】 Chronic pain — Pain lasting longer than six weeks is typically characterized as chronic. While the six-week threshold is arbitrary, it can be useful since many self-limited acute injuries (contusions) heal by the end of six weeks with appropriate rest. Among active children and skeletally immature adolescents, chronic pain often has a progressive pattern. As an example, a child with Osgood-Schlatter disease may initially only have pain over the tibial tuberosity at the end of a basketball practice but may progress over weeks to the point where pain develops after five minutes of playing or even at rest.\n【7】 Chronic pain should also alert the clinician to the possibility of a systemic disease (eg, reactive arthritis, toxic synovitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, arthritis as part of a rheumatologic disease, or malignancy) that is presenting as bone or joint pain (table 1).\n【8】 HISTORY — In the evaluation of a child or skeletally immature adolescent with knee pain or injury, it is important to characterize the pain, identify other musculoskeletal symptoms, identify the underlying etiology, determine if systemic symptoms are present, and assess for prior knee injury or surgery [1,2].\n【9】 Pain description — A detailed description of the pain is essential at making the correct diagnosis. The following questions help to characterize the pain:\n【10】 ●How long have you had knee pain? – Chronic pain is defined by a duration of six weeks or longer. The evaluation of acute complaints is discussed separately. (See 'Definitions' above and  \"Approach to acute knee pain and injury in children and skeletally immature adolescents\".)\n【11】 ●Was there a clear onset of pain? – A clear onset of pain suggests an acute injury that is persisting while progressively worsening pain with insidious onset is more typical of an overuse injury or joint pain as a manifestation of systemic illness.\n【12】 However, in the history of the progressively worsening pain it is useful to ask if there was a specific change in training, such as the intensity, duration or frequency of training, or equipment, such as a new pair of shoe or running on a new surface or the addition of running stairs. This can be considered a clear onset of symptoms. (See  \"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling\", section on 'Differential diagnosis'.)\n【13】 ●Where is the pain located? – The location of the pain often correlates with the specific knee structures that are damaged and helps to narrow the differential diagnosis. Chronic knee injuries often involve only one knee while systemic disease frequently presents with bilateral knee and pain in other joints. (See 'Diagnostic approach' below and  \"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling\", section on 'History'.)\n【14】 ●How severe is the pain? – Patients should be asked to rate their pain using any one of the age-appropriate validated pain scores. Pain out of proportion to what would be expected for the injury may indicate significant systemic illness or a chronic pain syndrome. (See  \"Pain in children: Approach to pain assessment and overview of management principles\", section on 'Severity assessment'.)\n【15】 ●Is the pain associated with swelling in the knee? – Constant, intermittent, or activity-related swelling may be helpful in assessing for structural versus systemic etiologies. Intermittent or activity-related swelling suggests structural conditions (eg, osteochondritis dissecans), while persistent swelling is more characteristic of underlying systemic diseases (eg, juvenile idiopathic arthritis).\n【16】 ●Do you have any hip pain or mechanical sensations? – An abnormal gait to avoid hip internal rotation can be the source of knee pain.\n【17】 ●Do you have back pain? Is there any associated numbness, tingling, or weakness in your leg? – The dermatomes of L3-S2 include the knee (L3-medial, L4- anterior, L5-lateral, S1-2- posterior). Rarely, in children and adolescents, knee pain may arise from lesions affecting these nerve roots.\n【18】 ●Do you have any other lower extremity injuries with pain on the same or opposite side? – Knee pain may arise from alterations in gait due to injuries in other joints.\n【19】 ●Does the pain only occur with specific activities? – Specific activities that trigger pain can be helpful in diagnosing knee pathology. As an example, pain with prolonged sitting or when climbing or descending stairs is a classic part of the history of patellofemoral pain.\n【20】 ●How much does this pain limit activities? – This can sometimes be a more objective measure of the severity of pain in pediatric patients.\n【21】 ●Does the pain occur at night? – Unilateral pain that awakens the patient from sleep can suggest a significant pathologic process, such as bone tumors or leukemia; conditions like tendinitis or patellofemoral pain rarely cause night pain. (See  \"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling\", section on 'Severity'.)\n【22】 By contrast, bilateral nocturnal pain that is paroxysmal, localized deep in the calf or thigh, described as crampy, and resolves by the morning in school-age and younger children is consistent with growing pains. (See  \"Growing pains\", section on 'Clinical features'.)\n【23】 ●What interventions have you tried for pain? Have they helped? – Pain that is improved with icing and rest, for example, is not likely to be due to a systemic process such as arthritis, infection or malignancy. Furthermore, response or lack of improvement to specific measures, such as a brace or rehabilitation exercises, can provide clues to the diagnosis.\n【24】 ●What makes the pain worse? – Specific movements or activities that exacerbate the pain can also help narrow the possible diagnoses and suggest activities to be avoided, such as what is meant by relative rest in prescribing a treatment plan.\n【25】 Other musculoskeletal symptoms — In patients who recall a specific event that was followed by pain, the clinician should determine the following:\n【26】 ●Mechanism of injury – For example, was it triggered by a specific event, or did it arise after repetitive activity? If a specific event was involved, are there videotapes of it or eyewitnesses who can describe what happened? Alternatively, the clinician can ask the patient to act out the injury to the extent that they can, in the office. For example, \"Show me exactly what position you were in when it happened.\" If repetitive activity was involved, what was the activity? What are the training demands of the activity? Was the patient using the appropriate equipment and sports technique?\n【27】 ●Mechanical symptoms (eg, locking, popping, or catching) – Locking of the knee suggests a mechanical block, as might occur with osteochondritis dissecans, a meniscal tear, or loose piece of cartilage. Note that it is important to differentiate a true mechanical block from the feeling that the knee is stuck or might pop if moved. Patients with a mechanical block often say they can unlock the knee by massaging or moving it in a certain manner.\n【28】 If the patient describes hearing an audible pop at the initial injury, anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) or other ligament tear is a concern. Teenagers and young adults who sustain an acute meniscal tear may also experience an audible pop at the time of injury.\n【29】 ●Instability (eg, \"giving way\") or functional limitation – It is important to distinguish true mechanical instability from pain-mediated instability. True instability occurs when the knee subluxes or \"gives way\" during a routine activity (eg, climbing stairs, walking) without pain preceding the episode. Such instability occurs with ligament tears and patellar instability and is more likely to be accompanied by immediate pain, disability, falling to the ground, and swelling. Pain-mediated instability occurs when knee or other lower extremity pain inhibits motor nerves controlling the quadriceps muscles causing the knee to buckle. Typically, these patients do not fall to the ground, do not have subsequent swelling, and can ambulate afterward. This can occur with any number of painful conditions.\n【30】 Systemic symptoms — Patients with musculoskeletal pain should be asked whether constitutional symptoms, such as fevers, chills, weight loss, poor growth, fatigue, or rash, accompany the pain. The presence of such symptoms suggests a systemic illness, and further investigation for infectious, rheumatologic, or neoplastic causes may be necessary. Knee pain that awakens the patient at night raises the concern for an infiltrative process (eg, a bone tumor or leukemia).\n【31】 The clinician should also determine whether there is a history of tick bite or annular rash in regions endemic for Lyme disease and ask about morning stiffness as a possible manifestation of pauciarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. (See  \"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling\", section on 'History'.)\n【32】 Prior knee injury or surgery — The most predictive risk factor for future knee injury is a history of prior injury. Patients should be queried regarding the timeline and treatment of any past lower extremity injuries and whether they were adequately rehabilitated. For example, ask the patient if they returned to 100 percent of function. Often, \"new\" injuries turn out to be complications of old injuries or incompletely rehabilitated injuries (eg, patellofemoral pain from changes in running gait caused by plantar fasciitis).\n【33】 Surgery is another important risk factor for evaluating knee pain. Surgical repairs can fail, leading to symptoms from recurrent injury. In addition, children and adolescents who undergo surgery that successfully restores function inevitably experience some degree of deconditioning that predisposes to new overuse injuries. This risk is greatest in those patients who undergo suboptimal rehabilitation or attempt to return to activities too quickly. In our opinion, these patients should be reevaluated first by the surgeon who did the procedure.\n【34】 Activity level — In order to assess the patient's stress to their knee, a careful history of their sports and physical activity is extremely important as follows:\n【35】 ●In which sports or activities are they participating?\n【36】 ●What position do they play?\n【37】 ●How frequently are they participating in their sport (in school and outside of school)?\n【38】 ●How many practices per week are they participating in?\n【39】 ●How many games do they have per week?\n【40】 ●Are they playing tournaments on the weekend?\n【41】 ●Is there a change in the level of activity associated with the onset of the knee pain?\n【42】 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION — The physical examination should determine the presence of any findings of systemic disease as follows (see  \"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling\", section on 'Physical examination'):\n【43】 ●Ill appearance\n【44】 ●Pallor\n【45】 ●Weight loss or change in the growth curve\n【46】 ●Fever\n【47】 ●Rash\n【48】 ●Erythema and/or warmth over the knee\n【49】 ●Tenderness or swelling in other joints or over other regions of the body\n【50】 Further evaluation of pediatric patients with joint pain and swelling and findings of systemic disease are discussed separately. (See  \"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling\", section on 'Diagnostic studies'.)\n【51】 In addition, all children and skeletally immature adolescents with chronic knee pain warrant evaluation of the hip for findings of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) or avascular necrosis (Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease), such as pain and limited range of motion at the hip. (See  \"Evaluation and management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)\", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and  \"Approach to hip pain in childhood\", section on 'Legg-Calvé-Perthes and secondary avascular necrosis'.)\n【52】 In pediatric patients without signs of systemic disease or hip pathology, a careful knee examination guided by history with attention to lower extremity malalignment, the site of greatest tenderness, patellar tracking, evidence of muscle inflexibility, inadequate strength, poor proprioception, and close evaluation of gait can frequently identify the underlying cause. Special tests are selected based upon the most likely diagnostic category, which is based in turn upon the history, including the mechanism of any injury and the location of pain. (See  \"Physical examination of the knee\".)\n【53】 The physical examination techniques used to diagnose ligamentous and meniscal injuries in patients with chronic knee pain are the same as those for acute injuries (see  \"Physical examination of the knee\", section on 'Assessing joint stability' and  \"Physical examination of the knee\", section on 'Tests for meniscal tear'):\n【54】 ●McMurray, modified McMurray, and bounce home test to evaluate the menisci (picture 1)\n【55】 ●Valgus stress test to evaluate the medial collateral ligament (MCL) (picture 2)\n【56】 ●Varus stress test to evaluate the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) (picture 2)\n【57】 ●Anterior drawer (picture 3), Lachman (picture 4), and pivot shift test (figure 1) to evaluate the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)\n【58】 ●Posterior drawer and posterior sag test to evaluate the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) (figure 2)\n【59】 Guidance about which examination techniques are most useful for diagnosing specific chronic conditions is provided in the text below and a topic devoted to the knee examination. (See 'Diagnostic approach' below and  \"Physical examination of the knee\".)\n【60】 DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH\n【61】 Pain from overuse or trauma — For the purposes of this topic, chronic knee pain is pain occurring during or after specific activities that has persisted for approximately six weeks or longer. In many pediatric patients, the diagnosis of chronic knee pain from overuse or trauma can be determined by a skillful history and physical examination. (See 'History' above and  \"Physical examination of the knee\".)\n【62】 Plain radiographs are recommended when there are mechanical symptoms of locking or catching, when an effusion is present, when the examiner is unable to reproduce the patient's chief knee complaints, and in patients who meet any one of the Ottawa knee rules criteria. (See 'Diagnostic imaging' below.)\n【63】 Chronic knee pain associated with overuse or trauma is typically progressive, becoming more painful with increasingly less intense activity over time. In patients whose history fits this description, examination of the following structures is essential (see  \"Physical examination of the knee\"):\n【64】 ●Patellofemoral joint\n【65】 ●Patella and patellar ligament (tendon) and quadriceps tendon (picture 5)\n【66】 ●Inferior pole of the patella and tibial tubercle (picture 5)\n【67】 ●Iliotibial band (picture 6)\n【68】 ●Lateral and medial meniscus\n【69】 ●Knee joint (figure 3)\n【70】 ●Pes anserine tendon and bursa (picture 7)\n【71】 ●Hip joint\n【72】 The location of pain and tenderness provides a useful means of narrowing the possible causes and determining which provocative diagnostic maneuvers should be performed. The differential diagnosis for chronic knee pain in children and skeletally immature adolescents by location of pain is provided in the table (table 2).\n【73】 In addition, assessment of the tightness of the hamstring, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, soleus, and hip flexor muscles and lower extremity alignment can be helpful as follows:\n【74】 ●Muscle inflexibility – Tight musculature is not a primary diagnosis and alone does not explain a patient's knee pain. However, restricted hamstring or iliopsoas or gastrocnemius-soleus flexibility is a common secondary finding in patients with patellofemoral pain and pes anserine pain, while quadriceps or hip flexor tightness serves as secondary findings in patients suffering from patellofemoral pain, patellar tendinitis, traction apophysitis (Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease or Osgood Schlatter syndrome), and other types of chronic knee pain. Thus, the secondary finding of decreased muscle flexibility can support the primary diagnosis and identify contributing kinetic chain abnormalities that will need to be rehabilitated.\n【75】 ●Lower extremity malalignment – The gait and kinetic chain of the lower extremity should be observed. It is important to note variations in alignment, such as genu valgum (knock knees), genu varum (bow legs), pes cavus (high-arched feet), pes planus or pronation (flat feet), and hallux valgus (lateral deviation of the great toe). To the extent that any of these kinetic chain variations interfere with load distribution throughout the lower extremity, they can contribute to overuse injuries of the lower extremities and pelvis. These injuries will recur unless the kinetic chain abnormalities are corrected. (See  \"Approach to the child with knock-knees\", section on 'Management' and  \"Approach to the child with bow-legs\", section on 'Management'.)\n【76】 The clinician should also observe the athlete standing on one foot at a time, and then as the patient slowly flexes the knee of the supporting leg. Weakness in the external rotators of the hip (eg, the piriformis) manifests as excessive internal rotation of the femur, a \"corkscrew\" configuration (ie, the knee of the involved leg moves excessively inward in a valgus motion), and instability or unsteadiness during a single-leg squat. (See  \"Physical examination of the knee\", section on 'Functional strength tests'.)\n【77】 Weakness of the hip abductors can also manifest as a Trendelenburg motion, in which the patient flexes the lumbar spine (ie, leans over the planted foot), often describing it as \"losing their balance.\"\n【78】 A patient who is quadriceps dominant, compared with the hamstrings and gluteus muscles, will bend forward when doing the single-leg squat. This relative imbalance of quadriceps strength to hamstring and gluteus strength affects the movement of the patellofemoral joint and the weight-bearing capability of the lower leg; it has implications for the long-term rehabilitation of all patients with chronic knee pain.\n【79】 Pain with systemic symptoms — Chronic or acute knee pain in an child or adolescent without inciting trauma or a history of overuse is a \"red flag\" that a more extensive evaluation is required, particularly if the pain is associated with constitutional symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, chills, malaise, weight loss, or fatigue or if the pain is severe enough to awaken the patient from sleep. In patients with knee pain unrelated to trauma or overuse but associated with systemic symptoms, a thorough physical examination should be performed, in addition to careful assessment of the knee. Depending upon the history and examination findings, additional testing including synovial fluid analysis, diagnostic imaging, and appropriate laboratory studies may be necessary. (See  \"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling\", section on 'Diagnostic studies' and 'Diagnostic imaging' below.)\n【80】 The evaluation of chronic joint pain or swelling not caused by overuse or trauma is discussed separately. Important diagnoses that may present primarily with unilateral knee pain (eg, referred pain from hip pathology and tumors both malignant and benign) are discussed below. (See  \"Evaluation of the child with joint pain and/or swelling\" and 'Referred hip pain' below and 'Tumors (malignant and benign)' below.)\n【81】 Diagnostic imaging — Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the studies performed most often in the evaluation of chronic knee pain in children and adolescents when the diagnosis cannot be made based on the history and physical examination alone.\n【82】 Suggested indications for each imaging modality include the following:\n【83】 ●Plain radiographs – Plain radiographs are recommended in patients with mechanical symptoms (eg, locking or catching), an effusion, findings of systemic disease (eg, fever or pain awakening from sleep), inability of the examiner to reproduce the patient's knee pain complaint, and any one of the following Ottawa knee rules criteria (see  \"Approach to acute knee pain and injury in children and skeletally immature adolescents\", section on 'Plain radiographs'):\n【84】 Plain radiographs are useful in evaluating for degenerative disease, loose bodies, osteochondritis dissecans, infection, bone tumors, and destructive lesions.\n【85】 Special views may be necessary, depending upon the diagnostic consideration:\n【86】 Plain radiographs of other regions (eg, hip, lumbar spine) should be obtained when clinical findings suggest referred hip or back pain or when additional joints may be affected by systemic disease.\n【87】 ●MRI – MRI is better able to demonstrate ligamentous and meniscal lesions [3,4]. However, its use should be limited to patients in whom the diagnosis is in question. For example, if a teenage swimmer complains of medial knee pain that, on exam, is most consistent with pes anserine tendinitis or patellofemoral pain and responds to appropriate rehabilitation, an MRI is not necessary.\n【88】 However, if the patient is adherent with rehabilitation that addresses the proper etiologies but is not improving, MRI may be indicated to assess for possible medial meniscus injury or chronic medial collateral ligament (MCL) insufficiency if the plan is to undergo diagnostic arthroscopy only if the MRI is abnormal. This approach recognizes that the positive predictive value for MRI-diagnosed meniscal injuries is less than 50 percent compared with arthroscopy, whereas the negative predictive value of MRI is greater than 95 percent but the same as clinical examination [5-7].\n【89】 MRI is approximately 90 percent accurate in identifying surgically confirmed anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and meniscal injuries [3,4,8]. However, it is no more accurate than the physical examination by an experienced clinician [8-10]. For this reason, providers who are unskilled in the knee examination should refer patients with knee complaints to a sports medicine clinician or orthopedic surgeon with training in sports medicine before ordering an MRI.\n【90】 CONDITIONS BY LOCATION OF PAIN — Causes and distinguishing features for chronic knee pain in children and skeletally immature adolescents are provided in the table (table 2).\n【91】 Anterior pain — The patellofemoral pain is the most common cause of chronic anterior knee pain among adolescents evaluated by sports medicine specialists [11]. Other common conditions in children and skeletally immature adolescents include Sinding-Larsen-Johansson (SLJ) syndrome, patellar tendinitis, Osgood-Schlatter disease, plica syndrome, and patellar subluxation (table 3). (See  \"Patellofemoral pain\", section on 'Epidemiology' and  \"Recognition and initial management of patellar dislocations\", section on 'Epidemiology' and  \"Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tuberosity avulsion)\", section on 'Epidemiology'.)\n【92】 Undiagnosed and unrehabilitated anterior cruciate ligament tears and lateral discoid meniscus tears are important traumatic causes of chronic knee pain. (See  \"Anterior cruciate ligament injury\", section on 'Mechanism and presentation' and  \"Meniscal injury of the knee\", section on 'Mechanism and presentation'.)\n【93】 Fat pad impingement, osteochondritis dissecans, referred pain from hip and back pathology, bipartite patella, patella stress fractures, benign and malignant tumors, and prepatellar bursitis are less common causes of chronic anterior knee pain.\n【94】 When possible, localization of the pain to specific structures supports the clinical diagnosis.\n【95】 Poorly localized pain\n【96】 Patellofemoral pain — Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is the most common condition causing chronic knee pain among patients referred to sports medicine specialists. Patients with PFP often complain of pain when ascending or descending stairs, running, or squatting, and pain and stiffness when rising from the seated position (the \"theater\" or \"movie-goer\" sign). The onset of PFP symptoms often follows a change in training, such as increased running mileage or pace, jumping activities, adding steps to the workout, squats, longer workouts, or new training techniques. (See  \"Patellofemoral pain\", section on 'History'.)\n【97】 Pain may occur in one or both knees. If an athlete is participating in a sport that has a side preference (eg, basketball players often jump off one leg when shooting a layup or fencers will have more problems on the leg that they lunge onto), it would be logical to have unilateral pain. If they are in sports such as running or cycling, that stress the knee symmetrically, then unilateral symptoms should prompt a more detailed exam of the entire kinetic chain to identify any contributing asymmetries.\n【98】 Pain is often poorly localized \"under\" or \"around\" the patella, and is usually described as \"achy\" but may be \"sharp.\" Some patients may describe the affected knee as \"giving way\" or \"buckling.\" In PFP, this perceived instability may be due to pain inhibiting proper contraction of the quadriceps, but it must be distinguished from instability arising from a patellar dislocation or subluxation, or from ligamentous injury of the knee. Although some patients may describe a \"catching\" sensation under the patella, true locking of the knee or effusion are signs of intraarticular pathology NOT explained by the diagnosis of PFP. Such findings require further evaluation. (See  \"Patellofemoral pain\", section on 'History' and  \"Approach to acute knee pain and injury in children and skeletally immature adolescents\".)\n【99】 On physical examination, PFP is suggested by the following physical findings (see  \"Patellofemoral pain\", section on 'Clinical presentation and examination'):\n【100】 ●Observation – Vastus medialis atrophy, angular and rotational deformities of the lower extremity\n【101】 ●Palpation – Quadriceps or patellar tendon tenderness; tenderness in the peripatellar areas, especially on the cartilaginous surfaces (patellar facets), especially in the lateral superior region, in our experience; and rarely, an effusion\n【102】 ●Strength – Limited quadriceps strength, hip abductor weakness (may cause increased quadriceps strength), and external rotator weakness\n【103】 ●Range of motion of the knee (crepitus with range of motion is a nonspecific finding)\n【104】 ●Quadriceps, iliopsoas, gastrocnemius-soleus, and hamstring tightness\n【105】 ●Excessive foot pronation\n【106】 In addition, special testing of patellofemoral function within the context of the history and physical examination can help establish the diagnosis. (See  \"Patellofemoral pain\", section on 'Special tests'.)\n【107】 PFP is a clinical diagnosis with no pathognomonic sign or symptom. In the child or skeletally immature adolescent it must be distinguished from other causes of anterior knee pain (table 3). (See  \"Patellofemoral pain\", section on 'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'.)\n【108】 The management of PFP is discussed in detail separately. (See  \"Patellofemoral pain\", section on 'Initial treatment' and  \"Patellofemoral pain\", section on 'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'.)\n【109】 Patellar subluxation — Patellar subluxation refers to excessive lateral movement of the patella and may occur as a result of trauma or in patients with laxity. These patients often complain of anterior and/or medial knee pain; popping or clicking with movement; and occasionally knee swelling, stiffness, or catching. Physical examination findings include a positive patellar apprehension test (apprehension and quadriceps contraction when the patella is pushed laterally by the examiner). The patella may also be high-riding and demonstrate abnormal tracking. In addition, patients may have tenderness of the underside of the patella (patellar facets) and tenderness over the medial femoral condyle. (See  \"Recognition and initial management of patellar dislocations\", section on 'Patellar subluxation'.)\n【110】 Patients with clinical findings suggesting patellar subluxation warrant plain radiographs including a sunrise view to evaluate for avulsion fractures of the patella or femoral condyle and patellar/femoral trochlear dysplasia. Treatment of patellar subluxation is provided separately. (See  \"Recognition and initial management of patellar dislocations\", section on 'Patellar subluxation'.)\n【111】 Osteochondritis dissecans — Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is defined as osteonecrosis of subchondral bone. Specifically, OCD is a localized lesion in which a segment of subchondral bone and articular cartilage separates from the underlying bone, leaving either a stable or unstable fragment. (See  \"Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD): Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis\", section on 'Definition'.)\n【112】 OCD of the knee typically presents with pain that may begin with a specific injury or can develop over several months in highly active patients. The pain is worsened by exercise. Early or small OCD lesions found in the knee typically will present with nonspecific, poorly localized knee pain with activity. As the process progresses, the patient may report gradual onset of stiffness, and intermittent swelling during or after activity. When advanced or larger lesions are present, the patient may experience catching or locking, especially if a loose foreign body is present. Loss of range of motion, however, is uncommon. (See  \"Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD): Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical presentation'.)\n【113】 The patient often has tenderness over the medial femoral condyle in the flexed knee. Wilson sign (pain with extension of the knee with the tibia medially rotated which resolves when the tibia is rotated laterally) is helpful if positive although it is negative in many patients with OCD.\n【114】 Patients with suspected OCD should initially undergo plain radiographs of the affected joint to make the diagnosis. Most OCD lesions are found on the medial femoral condyle and consist of a subchondral bony fragment surrounded by a crescent-shaped radiolucency (image 1). Tunnel views of the knee often provide the best visualization of the lesions in this location (image 2). (See  \"Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD): Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis\", section on 'Imaging'.)\n【115】 The management of OCD is discussed separately. (See  \"Management of osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)\".)\n【116】 Anterior cruciate ligament injury — The signs of chronic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) insufficiency include poorly localized pain, shifting, giving way, swelling, and anterior pain and do not differ from acute ACL injury. Up to 90 percent of patients with chronic ACL insufficiency will develop meniscal injuries. The physical examination techniques used to diagnose chronic ACL injuries are the same as those for acute injuries (ligamentous laxity on testing with anterior drawer (picture 3), Lachman (picture 4), and pivot shift test (figure 1)). (See  \"Anterior cruciate ligament injury\", section on 'Physical examination'.)\n【117】 The management of ACL injuries is discussed separately. (See  \"Anterior cruciate ligament injury\", section on 'Treatment'.)\n【118】 Referred hip pain — Chronic anterior knee pain can indicate referred pain from primary pathology in the hip, such as a slipped capital femoral epiphysis or Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (avascular necrosis of the femoral head).\n【119】 Adolescents with slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) can present with knee or thigh pain. Examination of the knee is normal, but range of motion of the hips, particularly internal rotation, is often limited. Urgent referral is necessary since a delay in diagnosis can be catastrophic. (See  \"Evaluation and management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)\", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)\n【120】 Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease is the name for idiopathic avascular necrosis of the secondary ossification center of the femoral head, which generally presents between 3 and 12 years of age. Patients complain of acute or chronic knee pain with activity. (See  \"Approach to hip pain in childhood\", section on 'Legg-Calvé-Perthes and secondary avascular necrosis'.)\n【121】 Referred back pain — Anterior knee pain caused by L2/L3/L4 radiculopathy is rare in children and adolescents. These patients also complain of back pain. Pain radiates to the anterior aspect of the leg down into the knee and occasionally down the medial aspect of the lower leg as far as the arch of the foot. On examination, there may be weakness of hip flexion, knee extension, and hip adduction. Higher lesions may result in greater weakness of the hip flexors. Sensation may be reduced over the anterior thigh down to the medial aspect of the lower leg. A reduced knee reflex may also be present. (See  \"Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'L2/L3/L4 radiculopathy'.)\n【122】 Because radiculopathy is rare in children and adolescents, plain radiographs and additional imaging, typically magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are indicated to identify the cause. Depending upon the findings, consultation with a pediatric neurologist or neurosurgeon is warranted.\n【123】 Urgent neuroimaging and consultation with a pediatric neurosurgeon should be performed in patients with any one of the following findings:\n【124】 ●Acute radiculopathy with progressive neurologic deficits\n【125】 ●Radiculopathy with urinary retention, saddle anesthesia, or bilateral neurologic symptoms or signs\n【126】 ●Suspected neoplasm\n【127】 ●Suspected epidural abscess\n【128】 Patellar stress fracture — Patella stress fractures are rare in children and skeletally immature adolescents but may present with an insidious onset of knee pain in patients who regularly engage in strenuous activity. Patients will have tenderness over the patella. Plain radiographs are normal within two to three weeks of the onset of pain and may not show abnormalities for months. MRI provides the most sensitive and specific means to establish the diagnosis. Patella stress fractures are at a high risk for nonunion and warrant prompt referral to a sports medicine clinician or pediatric orthopedic surgeon for management. (See  \"Overview of stress fractures\", section on 'Diagnosis' and  \"Overview of stress fractures\", section on 'High-risk sites'.)\n【129】 Tumors (malignant and benign) — Chronic anterior knee pain may rarely arise from tumors of the bone or bone marrow (eg, primary malignant, metastatic, or benign bone tumors and leukemias). Osteosarcomas, Ewing sarcoma, and many benign bone tumors have a predilection for the distal femur and proximal tibia. (See  \"Overview of common presenting signs and symptoms of childhood cancer\", section on 'Bone and joint pain' and  \"Osteosarcoma: Epidemiology, pathology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical presentation' and  \"Clinical presentation, staging, and prognostic factors of Ewing sarcoma\", section on 'Clinical presentation'.)\n【130】 Trauma, often minor, may be the initiating event that calls attention to a benign or malignant bone tumor. However, benign bone tumors are most often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on physical examination or radiographs when being evaluated for acute trauma. By contrast, the pain associated with malignant tumors, which may be mild at first, can be aggravated by exercise, and is often worse at night. A distinct soft tissue mass can sometimes be appreciated. When present, it is usually firmly attached to the bone and moderately to markedly tender to palpation. Fever may be present at diagnosis in patients with Ewing sarcoma or leukemia. (See  \"Nonmalignant bone lesions in children and adolescents\" and  \"Osteosarcoma: Epidemiology, pathology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis\" and  \"Clinical presentation, staging, and prognostic factors of Ewing sarcoma\".)\n【131】 Radiographs should be obtained in a timely manner for any child who complains of persistent bone or joint pain, especially if the pain is abrupt in onset, nocturnal, or associated with swelling; a palpable mass; or limited range of motion. Laboratory evaluation including a complete blood count with differential erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) also should be obtained. Further evaluation of children with suspected cancer or primary or metastatic malignant bone tumor is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"Bone tumors: Diagnosis and biopsy techniques\" and  \"Overview of common presenting signs and symptoms of childhood cancer\", section on 'Bone and joint pain'.)\n【132】 The clinical features, common locations, and plain radiographic features of benign bone tumors are summarized in the table and discussed separately (table 4). (See  \"Nonmalignant bone lesions in children and adolescents\".)\n【133】 Localized pain\n【134】 Traction apophysitis — In children and skeletally immature adults, apophysitis can result from chronic microtrauma at the insertion of the patellar tendon at the tibial tubercle (Osgood-Schlatter disease) and the inferior pole of the patella (Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease).\n【135】 Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tubercle apophysitis) — Osgood-Schlatter disease is an overuse injury caused by repetitive strain and chronic traction on the secondary ossification center (apophysis) of the tibial tubercle. It occurs in active adolescents who recently have undergone a rapid growth spurt. The anterior knee pain increases gradually over time, and may be exacerbated by direct trauma, running, jumping, or kneeling. The characteristic physical finding is exquisite tenderness over the tibial tubercle, focal swelling and warmth directly over the apophysis, and an otherwise completely normal knee examination. (See  \"Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tuberosity avulsion)\", section on 'Clinical presentation'.)\n【136】 The diagnosis of Osgood-Schlatter disease is made by clinical examination. Radiographs are not necessary unless the patient has atypical complaints (pain at night, pain that is unrelated to activity, acute onset of pain, associated systemic complaints), pain that is not directly over the tibial tubercle, or clinical concern for tibial tubercle avulsion. Patients with avulsion will not be able to take four steps and will have marked pain with quadriceps contraction. (See  \"Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tuberosity avulsion)\", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'.)\n【137】 The management of tibial tuberosity apophysitis (Osgood-Schlatter disease) is discussed separately. (See  \"Osgood-Schlatter disease (tibial tuberosity avulsion)\", section on 'Management'.)\n【138】 Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease (patellar apophysitis) — Sinding-Larsen-Johansson (SLJ) disease results from excessive activities that involve jumping with repetitive traction exerted by the patellar tendon on the patella and avulsion of the secondary ossification center (apophysis) of the inferior pole of the patella [2]. SLJ disease is sometimes incorrectly called \"jumper's knee\", a term that is used in adults to describe patellar and quadriceps tendinitis. SLJ disease typically affects children between 10 and 13 years of age. Physical examination demonstrates pain and swelling at the lower pole of the patella. Patellar tendon thickening and infrapatellar bursitis may also be present [12]. Otherwise, the patient should have no knee effusion or ligamentous laxity.\n【139】 Clinical findings establish the diagnosis of SLJ disease. Imaging is usually not necessary unless the patient has atypical complaints (pain at night, pain that is unrelated to activity, acute onset of pain, associated systemic complaints), pain that is not over the inferior pole of the patella, or clinical concern for a patellar sleeve fracture. Patients with sleeve fractures will not be able to take four steps and will have significant pain with quadriceps contraction.\n【140】 If obtained, plain radiographs findings of SLJ disease consist of fragmentation and irregular calcification if the ossification centers [2]. However, this finding is also seen in asymptomatic children and adolescents. Bedside ultrasound by an experienced provider can also demonstrate fragmentation of the lower pole of the patella, patellar tendon thickening at this insertion site, and infrapatellar bursitis [12].\n【141】 SLJ disease spontaneously resolves, typically in 12 to 18 months which coincides with the typical duration of peak growth in adolescents. However, it should be treated as any other overuse injury of the knee extensor mechanism, including rest with activity as tolerated, rehabilitation, application of ice, and a short course of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen) for patients with acute pain and swelling. Rarely, pain may necessitate knee immobilization. Once pain and swelling is controlled, reduction of activity and a patellar sleeve may permit a limited return to sports [13].\n【142】 Patellar and quadriceps tendinitis — The patellar and quadriceps tendons are the major extensor tendons of the knee. Tendinitis of these extensor tendons results from overuse and is sometimes called \"jumper's knee\" [14,15]. Patients, particularly those involved in running and jumping sports, complain of chronic anterior knee pain that may be worse after going up or down stairs or prolonged sitting. Among children and skeletally immature adolescents, patellar tendinitis is more commonly seen than quadriceps tendinitis and may be seen in combination with Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease (patellar apophysitis). (See  \"Patellar tendinopathy\" and 'Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease (patellar apophysitis)' above.)\n【143】 The location of tenderness distinguishes between these disorders: the patellar tendon in patients with patellar tendinitis and the superior pole of the patella in those with quadriceps tendinitis. The diagnosis is made clinically. Treatment of patellar and quadriceps tendinitis is discussed separately. (See  \"Patellar tendinopathy\" and  \"Quadriceps muscle and tendon injuries\".)\n【144】 Fat pad impingement (Hoffa disease) — In the knee, the infrapatellar fat pad is deep to the patellar tendon and extends from the inferior pole of the patella to the upper tibia (figure 4). Impingement of the fat pad causes vague achy pain deep to the patella that can be abrupt and sharp at a specific angle of flexion or extension [13]. Primary fat pad impingement is characterized by pain at terminal extension of the knee and is seen most often in dancers, gymnasts, or swimmers whose activities require kicking or maximum knee extension [2]. Fat pad impingement may also complicate patellar tendinitis, patellar sleeve fractures, or surgery to the cruciate ligaments or meniscus [13]. Rarely, pain may arise from primary conditions of the fat pad including direct trauma and tumors (eg, pigmented villonodular synovitis, hemangiomas, and sarcomas) [16].\n【145】 On physical examination, the patient has diffuse tenderness over the patellar tendon and infrapatellar fat pad and may have pain when performing knee extension against resistance [13]. Pain symptoms should be reproduced by the Bounce home test (figure 5).\n【146】 Infiltration of the fat pad with local anesthetic relieves the pain and can be used to differentiate fat pad impingement from other causes of anterior knee pain.\n【147】 Management depends upon the cause of impingement. Primary fat pad impingement frequently responds well to physical therapy and a short course of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (eg, ibuprofen) [2,13,16]. Treatment of the underlying cause typically resolves impingement due to patellar tendinitis, sleeve fractures or other etiologies (eg, fat pad tumors).\n【148】 If there is no anatomic lesion that is filling up the space making impingement easier, classic hyperextension injuries can result in the fat pad being pinched as well as potentially stretching the posterior capsule. In our experience, eccentric hamstring strength training will help these patients from repetitively impinging. (See  \"Hamstring muscle and tendon injuries\", section on 'Follow-up care and rehabilitation'.)\n【149】 Bipartite and tripartite patella — Bipartite and tripartite patella are rare causes of chronic knee pain in young adolescents [17]. These abnormalities occur at the lateral or supero-lateral portion of the patella. Symptoms can mimic iliotibial band (ITB) syndrome (fibers from the ITB insert in this region) and patellar instability which also causes lateral peripatellar pain. Affected patients may complain of pain at the separated fragments with strenuous activity. Examination demonstrates tenderness over the lateral or supero-lateral portion of the patella. Bony prominence at the site of tenderness can also occur. Radiographs identify the developmental anomaly but must be correlated with clinical findings of tenderness to make the diagnosis. Patients with symptomatic bipartite or tripartite patellae warrant referral to a sports medicine specialist for further management.\n【150】 Prepatellar bursitis — Direct repetitive trauma (as in wrestling or in a patient who spends a lot of time on his knees, such as those with conditions that affect ambulation) may cause inflammation of the prepatellar bursa, located between the patella and overlying skin. With chronic inflammation, the walls of the prepatellar bursa may thicken and become fibrotic. Patients typically have swelling and tenderness of the anterior knee (picture 8). The diagnosis can usually be made by simple inspection and palpation of the anterior patella. (See  \"Knee bursitis\", section on 'Prepatellar and superficial infrapatellar bursitis'.)\n【151】 Medial pain\n【152】 Plica syndrome — Plica syndrome may present with isolated medial pain or medial pain in association with anterior pain. Plica syndrome is caused by a redundant synovial thickening called a plica, usually in the medial superior portion of the medial retinaculum coursing toward the medial quadriceps tendon (figure 4). Patients may complain of anterior or medial pain that is worse with activity, such as running, squatting, going up or down stairs, or kneeling, and after prolonged sitting (cinema sign). The pain is often accompanied by a popping sensation with knee flexion. Patients may also report clicking, catching, knee pseudo-locking (false locking), or giving way. In most patients, only one knee is involved. Physical examination is nonspecific and may include a thickened tender plicae palpated in the medial superior portion of the knee, swelling medial to the patellar border, vague tenderness over the medial femoral condyle or patellar facet, or rarely, a snapping sensation during active or passive knee extension. (See  \"Plica syndrome of the knee\", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)\n【153】 The diagnosis of plica syndrome is primarily based upon clinical features and should only be made once other causes of knee pain have been excluded. Plain radiographs are frequently required to exclude other causes of knee pain. The type of imaging performed is determined by the leading alternative diagnoses. If magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed, a plica will be found in most patients, and MRI does not help distinguish between a normal variant and plica syndrome. Arthroscopy provides a definitive diagnosis if a thickened, fibrotic plica is demonstrated but is only performed when other diagnoses are considered or when conservative treatment fails. The treatment of plica syndrome is discussed separately. (See  \"Plica syndrome of the knee\", section on 'Diagnosis' and  \"Plica syndrome of the knee\", section on 'Initial treatment'.)\n【154】 Other causes — Other causes of chronic medial knee pain and important distinguishing characteristics include the following (table 2):\n【155】 ●Osteochondritis dissecans – Patients with advanced osteochondritis dissecans may have tenderness of the medial femoral epicondyle and, if an intraarticular foreign body is present, locking or catching during range of motion. (See  \"Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD): Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical presentation'.)\n【156】 ●Pes anserinus tendinitis – The pes anserinus is the site of insertion of the semitendinosus, gracilis, and sartorius tendons. Pes anserinus tendinitis is manifest as tenderness over the pes anserinus bursa, in the medial superior region of the tibia (picture 9). The pain is worsened by resisted contraction of the muscles that insert at the pes anserinus as follows (see  \"Knee bursitis\", section on 'Diagnosis' and  \"Knee bursitis\", section on 'Pes anserinus pain syndrome (formerly anserine bursitis)'):\n【157】 The treatment of pes anserinus involves rehabilitation that focuses on hip strength and balance to address knee valgus and internal rotation. (See  \"Knee bursitis\", section on 'Treatment'.)\n【158】 ●Medial meniscus injury – Patients with medial meniscus injury may report catching or locking of the knee. Physical examination demonstrates pain over the medial joint line (picture 10) and positive McMurray or modified McMurray tests (picture 1). Treatment is discussed separately. (See  \"Meniscal injury of the knee\", section on 'Treatment'.)\n【159】 ●Medial collateral ligament injury – Patients with a chronic medial collateral ligament (MCL) injury have tenderness over the ligament and a positive valgus stress test (picture 2). Management is provided separately. (See  \"Medial (tibial) collateral ligament injury of the knee\", section on 'Initial treatment'.)\n【160】 ●Medial superior tibial stress fracture – Stress fracture at the medial superior tibia can also be a source of medial knee pain. Initial plain radiographs frequently show no bony abnormality. MRI often confirms the diagnosis. Stress fractures are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  \"Overview of stress fractures\".)\n【161】 ●Adductor magnus strain – Adductor magnus strain is manifest as pain proximal to the origin of the MCL (approximately 4 cm proximal to the medial joint line) with resisted hip adduction. Pain at the adductor tubercle may also result from patellar instability with resulting stretching of the insertion of the medial patellar ligament, a more common condition in children and adolescents. (See  \"Adductor muscle and tendon injury\", section on 'Clinical presentation' and 'Patellar subluxation' above.)\n【162】 ●Referred hip pain – Referred hip pain can be also be medial. Knee examination is normal, but the hip examination is abnormal and reflects the underlying condition. (See 'Referred hip pain' above.)\n【163】 ●Bone tumors – Tumors of the bone or bone marrow (eg, primary malignant, metastatic, or benign bone tumors and leukemias) can rarely cause medial pain and swelling, depending upon the location and size of the tumor. (See 'Tumors (malignant and benign)' above.)\n【164】 Lateral pain\n【165】 Discoid meniscus and lateral meniscus injury — Children and skeletally immature adolescents may have a lack of development of the normal crescent shape of the meniscus with persistence of meniscal tissue over the tibial plateau [2]. Although a discoid meniscus may occur on either side, a lateral discoid meniscus is most common. Patients may report lateral pain associated with catching or popping during active knee extension. A discoid meniscus also tears more easily than a normal, crescent-shaped meniscus. Patients with a chronic lateral meniscal tear have a subjective history of the knee locking, swelling, and/or possibly giving way. On physical examination, they have lateral joint line tenderness (picture 10) and may have a positive McMurray or modified McMurray test (picture 1). Management is as for a meniscal injury, although a torn discoid meniscus frequently warrants arthroscopic surgery. (See  \"Meniscal injury of the knee\", section on 'Treatment'.)\n【166】 Chronic lateral meniscus tears in the absence of a discoid meniscus are uncommon in children and skeletally immature adolescents and usually are associated with injury to other structures (eg, lateral collateral ligament, posterolateral corner injury, or anterior cruciate ligament). Clinical findings are the same as described above for discoid meniscus tears.\n【167】 Iliotibial band syndrome — The iliotibial band (ITB) is formed by fascia from the hip flexors, extensors, and abductors. Iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS) is an overuse injury of the lateral knee that occurs primarily in runners and cyclists. Patients typically describe the insidious onset of pain localized to where the ITB courses over the lateral femoral epicondyle (LFE). Initially pain occurs only during sport. It is typically sharp or burning and occurs just prior to or during foot-strike when running, or as the knee extends (down-pedal position) when cycling. Over time, the pain can become constant and deep, persisting throughout exercise. Less commonly, pain persists for hours or days after exercise. (See  \"Iliotibial band syndrome\", section on 'Patient presentation'.)\n【168】 Key examination findings associated with ITBS include focal tenderness at the distal ITB where it courses over the LFE (picture 11), and a positive Noble compression test, which a number of experts believe is the single best test to confirm ITBS. The Ober test (picture 12) is another maneuver used by some to assess for ITB inflexibility, which can contribute to ITBS. Performance of the Noble compression and Ober tests are described in detail separately. (See  \"Iliotibial band syndrome\", section on 'Physical examination'.)\n【169】 ITBS is a clinical diagnosis. Imaging is usually not necessary, but the clinician needs to differentiate ITBS from chronic popliteus tendinitis. The treatment of ITBS is provided separately. (See  \"Iliotibial band syndrome\", section on 'Treatment'.)\n【170】 Other causes — Less common causes of chronic lateral knee pain in children and adolescents and important clinical manifestations include the following (table 2):\n【171】 ●Lateral collateral ligament injury – Chronic lateral collateral ligament (LCL) insufficiency typically occurs in combination with other injuries (eg, posterolateral corner, anterior or posterior cruciate ligament injury, or lateral meniscus tears). Clinical findings for chronic or acute LCL injury are the same and consist of tenderness along the lateral knee (picture 6), localized soft tissue swelling, and laxity of the LCL on varus stress testing (picture 2). The dial test is also performed to detect an associated injury to the posterior lateral corner (picture 13). (See  \"Lateral collateral ligament injury and related posterolateral corner injuries of the knee\", section on 'Examination findings'.)\n【172】 The treatment of LCL injuries is discussed separately. (See  \"Lateral collateral ligament injury and related posterolateral corner injuries of the knee\", section on 'Initial treatment'.)\n【173】 ●Biceps femoris tendinitis – Posterolateral knee pain can be caused by tendinitis of the biceps femoris muscles Patients with biceps femoris tendinitis have tenderness along the biceps tendon that increases with resisted knee flexion on the proximal fibula and may be accompanied by the sensation that the knee is popping, rubbing, or snapping mechanical sensations (eg, popping, rubbing, or snapping) if the fibula is mobilized by the examiner moving the fibula anteriorly or posteriorly.\n【174】 Management of biceps femoris tendinitis is discussed separately. (See  \"Hamstring muscle and tendon injuries\".)\n【175】 ●Referred hip pain – Referred hip pain can also manifest at the lateral knee. Knee examination is normal, but the hip examination is abnormal and reflects the underlying condition. (See 'Referred hip pain' above.)\n【176】 ●Referred back pain – Referred back pain from an L5 radiculopathy is a rare cause of lateral knee pain in children and adolescents. The pain localizes to the back and radiates down the lateral aspect of the leg to the knee and into the foot. On examination, strength can be reduced in foot dorsiflexion, toe extension, foot inversion, and foot eversion. Weakness of leg abduction may also be evident in severe cases due to involvement of gluteus minimus and medius. Atrophy may be present in the extensor digitorum brevis muscle of the foot and the tibialis anterior muscle of the lower leg. In severe cases, there may be \"tibial ridging,\" a condition in which the normal convexity of the anterior compartment of the leg is lost because of atrophy, leaving a prominent sharp contour of the medial aspect of the tibial bone. (See  \"Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'L5 radiculopathy'.)\n【177】 Because radiculopathy is rare in children and adolescents, plain radiographs and additional imaging, typically magnetic resonance imaging are indicated to identify the cause. Depending upon the findings, consultation with a pediatric neurologist or neurosurgeon is warranted.\n【178】 Urgent neuroimaging and consultation with a pediatric neurosurgeon should be performed in patients with any of the following findings:\n【179】 ●Bone tumors – Tumors of the bone or bone marrow (eg, primary malignant, metastatic, or benign bone tumors and leukemias) can rarely cause lateral pain and swelling, depending upon the location and size of the tumor. (See 'Tumors (malignant and benign)' above.)\n【180】 Posterior pain — Causes of chronic posterior knee pain include the following (table 2):\n【181】 ●Popliteal (Baker's) cyst – In children, popliteal (Baker's) cysts typically arise from the gastrocnemius-semimembranous bursa and do not extend from the knee joint. They cause asymptomatic swelling in the popliteal fossa on physical examination that appears as a medial popliteal mass that is most prominent with the patient standing and the knee fully extended. The swelling softens or disappears upon knee flexion to 45 degrees (defined as Foucher’s sign), as the tension on the cyst is relieved (picture 14). Most resolve spontaneously without treatment. Less commonly painful popliteal (Baker's) cysts can arise from injury to the knee joint or inflammatory joint changes. Popliteal (Baker's) cysts are discussed in greater detail separately. (See  \"Popliteal (Baker's) cyst\", section on 'Children' and  \"Popliteal (Baker's) cyst\", section on 'Diagnosis'.)\n【182】 ●Hamstring (semimembranous or biceps femoris) tendinitis – Semimembranous or biceps femoris distal tendinitis can cause posteromedial and posterolateral knee pain, respectively. Tenderness can be isolated to the body of the tendon or its insertion site. These structures are less commonly injured in children and adolescents. Evaluation and management of hamstring tendinopathy is discussed in detail separately. (See  \"Hamstring muscle and tendon injuries\".)\n【183】 ●Popliteus tendinitis – Patients with popliteus tendinitis often report walking or running down steep hills. Tendinitis can usually be diagnosed clinically. Important findings include tenderness of the tendon and increased pain with resisted activity. Patients with popliteus tendinitis have tenderness to palpation in the region of the posterior inferior lateral femoral condyle that increases with resisted internal rotation of the tibia in the posterior lateral knee. (See  \"Calf injuries not involving the Achilles tendon\", section on 'Popliteus tendinopathy'.)\n【184】 ●Referred hip pain – Referred hip pain can be also be posterior. Knee examination is normal, but the hip examination is abnormal and reflects the underlying condition. (See 'Referred hip pain' above.)\n【185】 ●Posterior cruciate ligament injury – Chronic posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) injury is rare in children. Symptoms include posterolateral pain and a feeling of instability when fully extending the knee. On physical examination, patients will display a positive posterior drawer test and/or posterior sag test. (See  \"Physical examination of the knee\", section on 'Tests for PCL injury and posterior stability'.)\n【186】 ●Deep venous thrombosis – Deep venous thrombosis of the popliteal vein occurs rarely in normal healthy children. When present, the physical examination findings may include warmth, swelling, redness, a palpable cord, and tenderness on compression of the site. Laboratory studies, including a D-dimer and imaging (eg, ultrasound) are necessary to make the diagnosis. The pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of deep vein thrombosis in children are discussed separately. (See  \"Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (VTE) in children: Risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\" and  \"Venous thrombosis and thromboembolism (VTE) in children: Treatment, prevention, and outcome\".)\n【187】 ●Referred back pain – S1 radiculopathy is a rare cause of posterior knee pain in children and adolescents. The pain radiates down the posterior aspect of the leg into the foot from the back. On examination, weakness of plantar flexion (gastrocnemius muscle) is specific. There may also be weakness of leg extension (gluteus maximus) and toe flexion. Sensation is generally reduced on the posterior aspect of the leg and the lateral edge of the foot. Ankle reflex loss is typical. (See  \"Acute lumbosacral radiculopathy: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'S1 radiculopathy'.)\n【188】 Because radiculopathy is rare in children and adolescents, plain radiographs and additional imaging, typically magnetic resonance imaging are indicated to identify the cause. Depending upon the findings consultation with a pediatric neurologist or neurosurgeon is warranted.\n【189】 ●Bone tumors – Tumors of the bone or bone marrow (eg, primary malignant, metastatic, or benign bone tumors and leukemias) can rarely cause posterior pain and swelling alone, depending upon the location and size of the tumor. (See 'Tumors (malignant and benign)' above.)\n【190】 INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, \"The Basics\" and \"Beyond the Basics.\" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【191】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on \"patient info\" and the keyword(s) of interest.)\n【192】 ●Basics topics (see  \"Patient education: Meniscal tear (The Basics)\" and  \"Patient education: Osgood-Schlatter disease (The Basics)\")\n【193】 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n【194】 ●Definitions – For this topic, chronic knee pain is pain occurring during or after specific activities that has persisted for approximately six weeks or longer. In many patients, the diagnosis of chronic knee pain from overuse or trauma can be determined by the history and physical examination. (See 'History' above and 'Physical examination' above.)\n【195】 ●Differential diagnosis – The location of pain and tenderness provides a useful means of narrowing the possible causes and determining which provocative diagnostic maneuvers should be performed. The differential diagnosis organized by location of pain and by distinguishing features of conditions associated with diffuse or localized anterior knee pain are provided in the tables (table 2 and table 3). (See 'Pain from overuse or trauma' above and 'Conditions by location of pain' above.)\n【196】 ●Diagnostic imaging – Plain radiographs are recommended when there are mechanical symptoms of locking or catching, when an effusion is present, when the examiner is unable to reproduce the patient's chief knee complaints, and in patients who meet any of the Ottawa knee rules criteria. (See 'Diagnostic imaging' above.)\n【197】 ●Signs of possible dangerous causes – Chronic or acute knee pain in a child or skeletally immature adolescent without inciting trauma or a history of overuse is a \"red flag\" that a more extensive evaluation is required. This is especially so if the pain is associated with constitutional symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, chills, malaise, weight loss, or fatigue, or if the pain is severe enough to awaken the child from sleep.

Also see Lidocaine monograph. Frequency not defined.\n【19】 Central nervous system: Burning sensation, localized warm feeling, paresthesia (localized), stinging sensation\n【20】 Dermatologic: Localized erythema\n【21】 Local: Localized edema\n【22】 Contraindications\n【23】 Hypersensitivity to lidocaine, menthol, local anesthetic of the amide type, or any component of the formulation; secondary bacterial infection at application site; traumatized mucosa. Contraindications may vary by product/formulation; also refer to manufacturer's labeling.\n【24】 Warnings/Precautions\n【25】 • Hypersensitivity: Use with caution in patients with known drug sensitivities. Allergic reactions (cutaneous lesions, urticaria, edema, or anaphylactoid reactions) may be a result of sensitivity to lidocaine (rare) or preservatives used in formulations. Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (eg, procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine.\n【26】 • Local effects: Irritation, sensitivity, burns (rare), and/or infection may occur at the site of application; discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy if local effects occur.\n【27】 • Methemoglobinemia: Has been reported with local anesthetics; clinically significant methemoglobinemia requires immediate treatment along with discontinuation of the anesthetic and other oxidizing agents. Onset may be immediate or delayed (hours) after anesthetic exposure. Patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites, or infants <6 months of age are more susceptible and should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (eg, cyanosis, headache, rapid pulse, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, fatigue).\n【28】 • Systemic adverse effects: Potentially life-threatening side effects (eg, irregular heartbeat, seizures, coma, respiratory depression, death) have occurred when lidocaine is used prior to cosmetic procedures. Excessive dosing for any indication (eg, application to large areas, use above recommended dose, application to denuded or inflamed skin, applying longer than recommended), smaller patients, and/or impaired elimination may lead to increased absorption and systemic toxicity. Patient should adhere strictly to recommended dosage and administration guidelines; serious adverse effects may require the use of supportive care and resuscitative equipment; lidocaine toxicity may occur at blood concentrations >5 mcg/mL.\n【29】 • Acutely ill patients: Use with caution; acutely ill patients should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status.\n【30】 • Debilitated patients: Use with caution; debilitated patients should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status.\n【31】 • Older adult: Use with caution; elderly patients should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status.\n【32】 • Hepatic impairment: Use caution in patients with severe hepatic disease due to diminished ability to metabolize systemically absorbed lidocaine.\n【33】 • Pediatric: Use with caution; children should be given reduced doses commensurate with their age and physical status.\n【34】 • Benzyl alcohol: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol and/or sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (\"gasping syndrome\") in neonates; the \"gasping syndrome\" consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP [\"Inactive\" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggest that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol and/or benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.\n【35】 • Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.\n【36】 • Topical gel (Rx): Avoid exposing application site to external heat sources (eg, heating pad, electric blanket). Keep away from open flame and do not heat, microwave, or add to hot water; flammable.\n【37】 • Topical patch: Avoid exposing application site to external heat sources (eg, heating pad, electric blanket, heat lamp, hot tub).\n【38】 • Self-medication (OTC use): When used for self-medication, discontinue use and contact health care provider if symptoms persist >7 days, condition worsens or recurs, or if rash, irritation, itching, or skin injury (eg, pain, swelling, blistering) develops. Do not use on open wounds, cuts, damaged or infected skin; in the eyes, mouth, genitals; or any other mucous membranes. Do not use in large quantities, particularly over raw or blistered areas. Some products are not recommended for use with bandages; consult specific product labeling.\n【39】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【40】 The FDA recommends against using topical OTC medications for teething pain as some products may cause harm; the use of OTC topical anesthetics (eg, benzocaine) for teething pain is also discouraged by AAP and The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAP 2011; AAPD 2012). The AAP recommends managing teething pain with a chilled (not frozen) teething ring or gently rubbing/massaging with the caregiver's finger.\n【41】 Topical patches (both used and unused) may cause toxicities in children; used patches still contain large amounts of lidocaine; store and dispose patches out of the reach of children.\n【42】 Dosage Forms: US\n【43】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Note: Use in combination with chlorothiazide to minimize fluid retention and during initial management (eg, acute situations), concomitant IV dextrose infusion used. Dosing should be individualized to patient response to achieve and maintain target serum glucose concentrations (typically >70 mg/dL) (Sperling 2014). Use the least amount of drug that achieves the desired clinical and laboratory results. Positive therapeutic responses are seen in 50% of neonates within 48 to 72 hours; after 5 days of therapy, evaluate overall response (Eichenwald 2017; Sperling 2014).

Pulmonary hypertension has been reported in newborns and young infants and was reversible upon drug discontinuation; monitor patients (especially patients with risk factors for pulmonary hypertension) for respiratory distress and discontinue diazoxide if pulmonary hypertension is suspected.\n【51】 • Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP [\"Inactive\" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.\n【52】 • Propylene glycol: Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; large amounts are potentially toxic and have been associated hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Zar 2007).\n【53】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【54】 Initiate treatment with diazoxide under close clinical supervision; carefully monitor blood glucose and clinical response until patient's condition becomes stable (usually several days). Regular monitoring of urine for glucose and ketones (especially under conditions of stress) are required with prolonged therapy; abnormal results should be reported to physician promptly. Periodic monitoring of blood glucose is required for dosage adjustment.\n【55】 Pulmonary hypertension has been reported in newborns and infants receiving diazoxide for hypoglycemia; since the early 1970’s, eleven cases have been reported either to the FDA or within the literature; in the majority of cases, the neonate/infant had other ongoing serious medical conditions and were at high risk for development of pulmonary hypertension; reported onset was within a day to a few months after diazoxide therapy initiation and in all cases, the pulmonary hypertension resolved or improved with discontinuation of the diazoxide. Pulmonary hypertension may be dose dependent; a review of published cases reported that circulatory effects were observed most frequently at doses ≥10 mg/kg/day. Monitor neonates and infants closely for signs of respiratory distress (tachypnea, flaring nostrils, grunting, chest wall retractions), cyanosis, or feeding intolerance, particularly those neonates and infants with risk factors for pulmonary hypertension (eg, meconium aspiration syndrome, respiratory distress syndrome, transient tachypnea of the newborn, pneumonia, sepsis, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital heart disease); discontinue if pulmonary hypertension is identified (FDA 2015; Timlin 2017).\n【56】 Transient cataracts have been reported in an infant in association with hyperosmolar coma; cataracts subsided following correction of hyperosmolarity. Abnormal facial features have been reported in 4 children who received diazoxide for >4 years for the treatment of hypoglycemia hyperinsulinism.\n【57】 The oral suspension contains 7.25% alcohol. Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; in neonates large amounts of propylene glycol delivered orally, intravenously (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically have been associated with potentially fatal toxicities which can include metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, and CNS depression; toxicities have also been reported in children and adults including hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Shehab 2009).\n【58】 Dosage Forms: US\n【59】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【60】 Suspension, Oral:\n【61】 Proglycem: 50 mg/mL (30 mL) [chocolate mint flavor]\n【62】 Generic: 50 mg/mL (30 mL)\n【63】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【64】 Yes\n【65】 Pricing: US\n【66】 50 mg/mL (per mL): $12.38 - $12.40\n【67】 50 mg/mL (per mL): $16.26\n【68】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【69】 Capsule, Oral:\n【70】 Proglycem: 100 mg\n【71】 Administration: Pediatric\n【72】 Oral: Shake suspension well before each use; suspension comes with calibrated dropper (to deliver dose of 10 to 50 mg, in 10 mg increments).\n【73】 Administration: Adult\n【74】 Shake suspension well before each use.\n【75】 Storage/Stability\n【76】 Store at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F). Protect from light. Store in carton until contents are used.\n【77】 Use\n【78】 Management of hypoglycemia related to hyperinsulinism secondary to the following conditions: Islet cell adenoma, adenomatosis, or hyperplasia; extrapancreatic malignancy; nesidioblastosis; leucine sensitivity (All indications: FDA approved in neonates, infants, and children)\n【79】 Management of hypoglycemia related to hyperinsulinism secondary to the following conditions: Inoperable islet cell adenoma or carcinoma; extrapancreatic malignancy (FDA approved in adults)\n【80】 Medication Safety Issues\n【81】 Sound-alike/look-alike issues:\n【82】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【83】 None known.\n【84】 Drug Interactions\n【85】 (For additional information: Launch drug interactions program)\n【86】 Antidiabetic Agents: Hyperglycemia-Associated Agents may diminish the therapeutic effect of Antidiabetic Agents.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【87】 Blood Pressure Lowering Agents: Diazoxide may enhance the hypotensive effect of Blood Pressure Lowering Agents.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【88】 Fosphenytoin-Phenytoin: Diazoxide may decrease the serum concentration of Fosphenytoin-Phenytoin. Total phenytoin concentrations may be affected more than free phenytoin concentrations.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【89】 Thiazide and Thiazide-Like Diuretics: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Diazoxide. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【90】 Thiopental: May enhance the hypotensive effect of Diazoxide. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【91】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【92】 Diazoxide crosses the human placenta and appears in cord blood. Altered carbohydrate metabolism, hyperbilirubinemia, and thrombocytopenia have been reported in the fetus or neonate. Alopecia and hypertrichosis lanuginosa have also been reported in infants following maternal use of diazoxide during the last 19 to 60 days of pregnancy.\n【93】 Monitoring Parameters\n【94】 Blood glucose, serum uric acid, electrolytes, renal function (BUN, SCr); AST, CBC with differential, platelets; urine glucose and ketones (baseline and frequently during therapy initiation and then periodically); blood pressure (especially with IV therapy), heart rate; signs of pulmonary hypertension (neonates/infants [eg, respiratory, cyanosis, feeding intolerance]); consider echocardiogram in neonates and infants (baseline, after initiation [5 days of therapy], and periodically) (Timlin 2017)\n【95】 Mechanism of Action\n【96】 Opens ATP-dependent potassium channels on pancreatic beta cells in the presence of ATP and Mg2+, resulting in hyperpolarization of the cell and inhibition of insulin release. Diazoxide binds to a different site on the potassium channel than the sulfonylureas (Doyle, 2003).\n【97】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【98】 Onset of action: Hyperglycemic: Oral: Within 1 hour\n【99】 Duration: Hyperglycemic: Oral: Normal renal function: ≤8 hours\n【100】 Protein binding: >90%\n【101】 Half-life elimination: Oral: Children: 9.5 to 24 hours; Adults: 24 to 36 hours\n【102】 Excretion: Urine (50% as unchanged drug)\n【103】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【104】 Altered kidney function: Plasma half-life is prolonged.\n【105】 Brand Names: International\n【106】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Diazoxide  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/diazoxide-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E6%96%B0%E7%94%9F%E5%84%BF%E6%99%9A%E6%9C%9F%E4%BB%A3%E8%B0%A2%E6%80%A7%E9%85%B8%E4%B8%AD%E6%AF%92&source=search_result&selectedTitle=88%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

Reactions reported with Duodote. Also see individual agents.\n【20】 Cardiovascular: Transient increase of blood pressure (usually occurring 15 minutes after administration and returning to baseline 4 hours post-dose)\n【21】 Central nervous system: Hypertonia (at injection site; mild-to-moderate)\n【22】 Local: Pain at injection site (mild-to-moderate)\n【23】 Contraindications\n【24】 No contraindications exist in the treatment of life-threatening organophosphate insecticide or nerve agent poisoning\n【25】 Warnings/Precautions\n【26】 • Atropinization: Signs of atropinization (eg, flushing, mydriasis, tachycardia, dryness of mouth or nose) may occur earlier than expected with the use of a combination product as compared to atropine alone. Monitor effects closely when administering subsequent injections as necessary. The presence of these effects is not indicative of the success of therapy. Reversal of bronchial secretions is the preferred indicator of success.\n【27】 • Hyperthermia: Atropine may inhibit sweating and possibly lead to heat-related injury or hyperthermia in patients exposed to warm environments or exercise.\n【28】 • Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with heart disease, arrhythmias (eg, atrial flutter), severe CAD, or history of recent MI; treatment-related blood pressure increases and tachycardia may lead to ischemia, precipitate an MI, or increase arrhythmogenic potential.\n【29】 • Chronic lung disease: Use with caution in patients with chronic lung disease; may cause inspiration of bronchial secretions and formation of dangerous viscid plugs.\n【30】 • Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; effects of atropine may be prolonged in severe hepatic impairment.\n【31】 • Myasthenia gravis: Use with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis; may precipitate myasthenic crisis.\n【32】 • Narrow-angle glaucoma: Use with caution in patients with severe narrow-angle glaucoma; may precipitate acute glaucoma.\n【33】 • Pyloric stenosis: Use with caution in patients with pyloric stenosis; may cause complete pyloric obstruction.\n【34】 • Renal impairment: Use with caution in renal impairment; pralidoxime is excreted renally and the effects of atropine may be prolonged in severe renal impairment.\n【35】 • Urinary obstruction: Use with caution in patients with urinary obstruction; may cause urinary retention.\n【36】 • Older adult: May be more sensitive to the anticholinergic effects of atropine.\n【37】 • Pediatric: May be more sensitive to the anticholinergic effects of atropine.\n【38】 • Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP [\"Inactive\" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.\n【39】 • Appropriate use: Clinical symptoms consistent with highly-suspected organophosphate insecticide or nerve agent poisoning should be treated with antidote immediately; administration should not be delayed for confirmatory laboratory tests. Treatment should always include proper evacuation and decontamination procedures; medical personnel should protect themselves from inadvertent contamination. Antidotal administration is intended only for initial management; definitive and more extensive medical care is required following administration. Individuals should not rely solely on antidote for treatment, as other supportive measures (eg, artificial respiration) may still be required. Continued administration of additional doses in asymptomatic patients may result in atropine toxicity.\n【40】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【41】 CNS effects (eg, restlessness, tremor, fatigue, locomotor difficulties, delirium, hallucinations) of atropine are often seen earlier and at lower doses in pediatric patients compared to adults.\n【42】 Dosage Forms: US\n【43】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【44】 Injection, solution:\n【45】 ATNAA, Duodote: Atropine 2.1 mg/0.7 mL and pralidoxime chloride 600 mg/2 mL [contains benzyl alcohol; prefilled autoinjector]\n【46】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【47】 No\n【48】 Pricing: US\n【49】 2.1-600 mg (per mL): $22.58\n【50】 Additional Information\n【51】 Evacuation and decontamination procedures should be undertaken as soon as possible. Medical personnel need to protect themselves from accidental exposure. Primary prophylaxis against organophosphate  nerve agents should always consist of appropriate protective garments and masks. Organophosphate agents are well absorbed through skin, lungs, and GI tract. They are usually described as having a petroleum or garlic like odor. Once absorbed, organophosphate agents bind to acetylcholinesterase (also known as RBC acetylcholinesterases) and inactivate the enzyme. Acetylcholinesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of acetylcholine to choline and acetic acid; therefore, once inactivated excess acetylcholine accumulates.\n【52】 Clinical symptoms of toxicity are associated with cholinergic excess and involve the autonomic nervous system, CNS, and neuromuscular junction. Clinical features of acute cholinergic toxicity include bradycardia, miosis, lacrimation, salivation, bronchorrhea, bronchospasm, emesis and diarrhea. At times, mydriasis and tachycardia may be observed. 100% oxygen and fluid resuscitation are important initial steps in management. Onset and duration of clinical features consistent with poisoning vary depending on agent and route of exposure; therefore, every effort should be made to identify poisoning agent. In addition, time interval to “aging” process (irreversible binding between organophosphates and acetylcholinesterase) vary depending on nerve agent. Once “aging” has occurred, oxime therapy (eg, pralidoxime) is ineffective, thus making timing of antidote administration critical, particularly in the case of soman exposure where “aging” process occurs within minutes of exposure.\n【53】 Prescribing and Access Restrictions\n【54】 ATNAA (Antidote Treatment-Nerve Agent Auto-Injector) is only available for use by US Armed Forces military personnel. Information on distribution is available at Defense Services Supply Center-Philadelphia at 215-737-2341.\n【55】 Duodote is only available for use by trained emergency medical services personnel to treat civilians. Distribution is limited to directly from manufacturer (Meridian Medical Technologies, Inc) to emergency medical service organizations or their suppliers.\n【56】 Administration: Pediatric\n【57】 IM:\n【58】 DuoDote: Administer IM into the mid-lateral thigh. Hold the device firmly at the center with the green tip (needle end) pointing down; remove the gray safety release with the other hand; do not touch the green tip at any time. The device is now ready for administration into the mid-lateral thigh; removal of clothing is not necessary, but pockets should be empty. If patient does not have a lot of fat at the injection site, bunch up thigh tissue for a thicker injection area. Firmly push the green tip against the mid-lateral thigh. Hold firmly in place until auto-injector triggers and continue to hold for 10 seconds after the device has triggered. The needle does not retract; after administration, the needle should be visible; if the needle is not visible, repeat the above steps. After use, bend the needle against a hard surface to avoid accidental injury.\n【59】 Administration: Adult\n【60】 ATNAA: May be administered in the lateral thigh muscle or buttocks. The first dose may be self-administered; subsequent doses must be administered by a buddy. Remove the gray safety cap from the back end; place the front end on the outer thigh or buttocks and push hard to activate the injector. Hold firmly in place for 10 seconds. After use, bend the needle into a hook shape against a hard surface.\n【61】 DuoDote: Self-administration: Hold the device firmly at the center with the green tip (needle end) pointing down; remove the gray safety release with the other hand. Do not touch the green tip at any time. Removal of clothing is not necessary, but pockets should be empty. Firmly push green tip straight down (90° angle) against the mid-lateral thigh. Hold firmly in place until auto-injector triggers and for ~10 seconds after device has triggered. After administration, the needle will be visible; if the needle is not visible, repeat the above steps. After use, bend the needle against a hard surface (needle does not retract) to avoid accidental injury.\n【62】 Storage/Stability\n【63】 Store at 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F); avoid freezing.

In general, medications used as antidotes should take into consideration the health and prognosis of the mother; antidotes should be administered to pregnant women if there is a clear indication for use and should not be withheld because of fears of teratogenicity (Bailey 2003).\n【113】 Refer to individual monographs for additional information.\n【114】 Monitoring Parameters\n【115】 Respiratory status, ABGs, pulse oximeter; body temperature (especially in warm climates); blood pressure (peak effect occurs ~15 minutes after administration); symptoms of poisoning.\n【116】 Reference Range\n【117】 Direct measurement of RBC acetylcholinesterase activity provides a measure of degree of toxicity, although symptoms may not correlate with degree of inactivation unless activity reduced to <50%. Sequential measurement (if rapidly available) may help to determine the effectiveness of oxime therapy. Plasma (or pseudo) cholinesterase activity is more easily performed, but does not correlate well with the severity and should not be used to guide therapy.\n【118】 Mechanism of Action\n【119】 Atropine: Functions as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine at muscarinic receptors in the peripheral and central nervous system, thus reducing the symptoms of parasympathetic overstimulation resulting from excess acetylcholine caused by organophosphate insecticide or nerve agent poisoning. The parasympatholytic action of atropine decreases oral and respiratory secretions, relieves airway constriction, and attenuates the bradycardia induced by organophosphate insecticides and nerve agents. Antagonizes acetylcholine accumulation at respiratory center and may reduce centrally-mediated respiratory paralysis.\n【120】 Pralidoxime: An oxime which functions by way of nucleophilic attack on the ester site of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme which has been deactivated by phosphorylation. Displacement of the phosphoryl group allows reactivation of acetylcholinesterase’s hydrolytic activity, thus permitting renewed catalysis of accumulated acetylcholine. Destruction of accumulated acetylcholine allows for restoration of normal functioning at neuromuscular junctions and relief from respiratory muscle paralysis.\n【121】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【122】 See individual agents.", "title": "Atropine and pralidoxime  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/atropine-and-pralidoxime-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%8F%E7%BB%9C%E8%AF%81%EF%BC%88TM1%EF%BC%89&source=search_result&selectedTitle=13%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

These ectopic endometrial implants are usually located in the pelvis but can occur nearly anywhere in the body. The disease can occur in adolescents and can be associated with many distressing and debilitating symptoms, or it may be asymptomatic. Despite numerous studies, considerable controversy remains regarding the incidence, pathogenesis, natural history, and optimal treatment of this disorder.\n【2】 This topic will discuss endometriosis specifically in adolescents. The disease in adults is reviewed separately:\n【3】 In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms \"woman/en\" or \"patient(s)\" as they are used in the studies presented. We encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender diverse individuals.\n【4】 EPIDEMIOLOGY\n【5】 PATHOGENESIS — Many theories have been proposed to explain the etiology of endometriosis. No single theory explains all cases, and all of the theories help to explain some aspects of the disease. The types and frequencies of pathogenetic mechanisms may be different in adolescents and postpubertal/premenarchal endometriosis than in adult endometriosis. It is likely that the cause of endometriosis is multifactorial, with contributions from several of the proposed mechanisms. (See  \"Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical impact\", section on 'Pathogenesis'.)\n【6】 The following theories for the pathogenesis of endometriosis have been proposed:\n【7】 Several early life risk factors may also contribute to the development of endometriosis in adolescence. Prior studies have postulated breastfeeding in early life, secondhand smoke during childhood [21], and sexual and physical abuse in early life [22] are associated with increased risk of endometriosis. Dietary exposures in adolescence may impact the risk of subsequent endometriosis, such as dairy intake [23]. However, early life and adolescent interventions to reduce risk of endometriosis remain understudied and causality cannot be inferred from the above studies.\n【8】 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS — Heightened awareness of the clinical manifestations of endometriosis in the adolescent may decrease the length of time between patient presentation and clinical diagnosis, which averages nine years [8]. Ideally, early diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis will prevent or slow disease progression [24], and subsequently decrease the adverse long-term effects of the disease (chronic pain, endometriomas, infertility), and thus improve the quality of life of adolescents and women with this disorder.\n【9】 Adolescents with endometriosis usually have both acyclic and cyclic pain/cramps (severe, progressive dysmenorrhea) (table 1) [25]; isolated cyclic pain is the least common pain presentation [7]. Bowel symptoms (eg, rectal pain, constipation, painful defecation that may be cyclic, rectal bleeding) and bladder symptoms (eg, dysuria, urgency, hematuria) are also common [7]. Most adolescents with endometriosis have superficial disease, while deeply infiltrative endometriosis and ovarian endometriomas and infertility are rare in this age group.\n【10】 There can be overlap of symptoms that involve pelvic pain and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. If the young patient's pain is cyclic in nature and worse with their periods, a gynecologic evaluation may be warranted prior to a GI evaluation. GI symptoms can be common with endometriosis, but GI disorders do not typically have a cyclic relationship to menstrual cycles. Acyclic pelvic pain may be a strong predictor for the likelihood of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), thus screening for IBS should be considered [26]. If the adolescent has pain and a family history of endometriosis and/or infertility, a gynecologic evaluation may be the best first option for evaluation prior to a GI evaluation.\n【11】 By contrast, adults with endometriosis commonly have cyclic pain, and present with dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, a pelvic mass, infertility, or chronic pelvic pain. (See  \"Endometriosis: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical features'.)\n【12】 Differential diagnosis — Causes of pelvic pain in adolescents include pregnancy (intrauterine or ectopic), appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, müllerian abnormalities with outflow obstruction, hernia, bowel disease, urinary tract disease, and musculoskeletal issues. The etiology and evaluation of chronic pain in this population are discussed in detail separately. (See  \"Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents: Approach to the evaluation\", section on 'Etiology'.)\n【13】 INITIAL EVALUATION\n【14】 History — Questions that should be addressed by the history are listed in the figure (table 2). Having the patient keep a diary documenting the frequency and character of their pain will help determine whether the pain is cyclic, and if it is related to bowel or bladder function. Patients with a history of sexual or physical abuse may be at increased risk of developing chronic pelvic pain [27], but this should not preclude further evaluation for endometriosis. Mental health screening should also be considered as there is an increased risk of anxiety and depression in adolescents with symptoms of pelvic pain [28]. The patient's family may be involved in contributing to the history, but the history, including sexual activity, should be taken in private when appropriate. School absenteeism or decreased engagement in prior work, activities, or relationships should be assessed.\n【15】 A family history should be obtained, and it should be noted that if a patient has a first-degree relative with endometriosis or suspected disease, such as pelvic pain or infertility. In such situations, the patient is advised of a seven times greater risk of having endometriosis compared with the general population [29].\n【16】 Associated diseases — It should be noted that there is a higher than expected rate of autoimmune diagnoses in women with endometriosis compared with the general population [30-35]. There is an increased rate of arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, thyroid disease, migraine headaches, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's disease, postural orthostatic hypotension, and multiple sclerosis.\n【17】 Physical examination — The goal of the physical examination is to determine the etiology of the pain and to rule out an ovarian tumor or obstructive anomaly of the reproductive tract. The approach to abdominopelvic examination depends on the patient. Although important, it may not be possible to perform a complete pelvic examination in all adolescents, particularly those who have not been sexually active or are unable to use tampons. A pelvic exam should not be a barrier to further evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of endometriosis.\n【18】 The abdominal examination is usually normal but can be helpful in localizing the pain. Evidence of a reticulated pattern of hyperpigmentation, called erythema ab igne, would suggest chronic exposure to heat for pain relief (eg, heating pad, hot water bottle).\n【19】 We do not typically perform speculum and bimanual exams on adolescents. These exams will likely be low yield and uncomfortable and generally do not add information that cannot be obtained from imaging studies. On pelvic examination, adolescents rarely have uterosacral nodularity, a common finding in adults with deep or advanced disease. Adnexal enlargement may be palpable if an endometrioma is present, but these masses are also rare in adolescents [36]. Sonographic examination can be performed to augment (or in place of) a limited physical examination and identify/exclude causes of abdominopelvic pain other than endometriosis. (See 'Imaging studies' below.)\n【20】 Laboratory — Laboratory tests to consider include:\n【21】 CA 125 is most commonly used as a biomarker for ovarian cancer, but can be elevated in other conditions, including endometriosis. A serum CA 125 level is not a useful screening test due to its high rate of false positives as it is nonspecific (table 3). It has been used occasionally to follow the progress of disease in patients who have histologically or visually confirmed endometriosis at surgery [37], but we prefer to rely on the patient's report of self-specific symptoms, which is typically pain, to follow endometriosis, and thus do not use CA 125 in clinical management. (See  \"Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, epidemiology, and clinical impact\".)\n【22】 Imaging studies — In adult women with endometriosis, sonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can identify ovarian endometrioma and deeply infiltrative endometriosis, which are signs of more advanced disease. However, these tend to be less useful in diagnosis of endometriosis in adolescents since endometriomas and deep endometriosis are rare and the typical superficial peritoneal lesions of adolescent endometriosis cannot be appreciated with imaging. Still, ultrasound and MRI may be useful to identify/exclude several structural causes of pelvic pain in adolescents, such as ovarian torsion or hemorrhage, tumors, genital tract anomalies.\n【23】 MRI can be helpful to better define an abnormality suspected by sonography, but should not be used as a first-line imaging test because of its expense and poor sensitivity for detecting superficial peritoneal lesions, which is the most common form of endometriosis in adolescents [38-40]. Computed tomography is also an insensitive test in the diagnostic evaluation of endometriosis, unless an endometrioma is identified. (See  \"Endometriosis: Management of ovarian endometriomas\".)\n【24】 OUR APPROACH — The discussion below on the decisions leading to diagnosis and treatment options are not as straightforward as the headings imply (algorithm 1). While there is a clear statement on the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives (or progestin-only therapy for those with a contraindication or who prefer not to use estrogen) for the treatment of dysmenorrhea, the next steps for clinical evaluation and management of persistent pain are less clear. If an adolescent has continued pain on hormonal therapy and NSAID therapy after three months of treatment, there are no data suggesting that a different estrogen-progestin or progestin-only contraceptive will improve their symptoms. Thus, we advise moving to the next step for evaluation rather than opting for an alternative medical treatment.\n【25】 Patients whose pain persists after an initial trial of hormonal contraception with NSAID have several options for continued evaluation and management (algorithm 1). Traditional gynecologic teaching has promoted laparoscopy for surgical diagnosis and surgical management of endometriosis. However, in adult patients with symptoms suggestive of endometriosis, clinical diagnosis followed by medical management and/or surgical management are both viewed as reasonable options. Given the safety of hormonal suppression and similar efficacy to laparoscopy, the thinking has evolved that patients can be given a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis without the need for surgery. For patients who wish to avoid surgery, treatment includes medical suppression with continuous combination estrogen-progestin therapy, progestin alone, GnRH agonist with add-back, or GnRH antagonist. Selection of a specific agent is driven by ease of use, side effects, cost, and availability. In this setting, surgery is reserved for individuals whose pain does not resolve on medical therapy or those who desire a definitive surgical diagnosis before initiating treatment.\n【26】 As supporting data are limited, the decision to pursue surgical diagnosis versus attempt continued medical treatment based on a clinical diagnosis is guided by patient and family preferences. As part of the shared decision-making process, issues for discussion and consideration include:\n【27】 Regardless of which path is selected, for individuals with continued pain despite treatment with cyclic hormones and NSAIDs, the diagnosis is most likely endometriosis, and the treatment plan that most improves quality of life and functionality should be selected.\n【28】 TRIAL OF MEDICAL THERAPY FOR DYSMENORRHEA\n【29】 NSAIDs and hormonal therapy — Medical treatment of dysmenorrhea is appropriate prior to considering surgical intervention for diagnosis/treatment of endometriosis in adolescents with dysmenorrhea and/or who have difficulty participating in normal activities, are missing school, or avoiding extracurricular activities because of pelvic pain. A three month trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) is a reasonable approach when the pain evaluation suggests a nonacute gynecologic source, such as primary dysmenorrhea or endometriosis (table 4) [43]. The medication should be started before the expected onset of severe pain, if possible. (See  \"Primary dysmenorrhea in adolescents\".)\n【30】 Hormonal therapy, such as a cyclic low-dose combination estrogen-progestin oral contraceptive pill (OC), or progestin-only therapy (oral, injectable, or implantable), should be given with the NSAIDs [43]. There are no data suggesting one contraceptive pill formulation is better than another for the treatment of dysmenorrhea. Use of hormonal therapy leads to decidualization and subsequent atrophy of ectopic and eutopic endometrial tissue, thereby decreasing bleeding and, in turn, reducing bleeding-related pain. These agents are particularly useful in adolescents also needing contraception or menstrual management, which NSAIDs would not provide. The vaginal ring and transdermal contraceptive patch are other examples of methods of combined hormonal contraception and are acceptable alternatives to OCs. The vaginal ring may not be a desirable choice for some adolescents, such as those who do not utilize tampons. All of these methods are safe and effective if given cyclically, and the oral pill and vaginal ring may be used in an extended or continuous fashion [44-46]. The extended cycle regimen has been successful in women whose pain did not respond to cyclic therapy but is associated with more unscheduled bleeding. (See  \"Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain\", section on 'Estrogen-progestin contraceptives' and  \"Hormonal contraception for suppression of menstruation\" and  \"Contraception: Issues specific to adolescents\", section on 'Pill, patch, or ring'.)\n【31】 If the pain does not resolve with NSAIDs and hormonal therapy, then further evaluation is necessary.\n【32】 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists — For adult women in whom endometriosis is the suspected cause of the pain, an expert panel opined that a trial of medical therapy with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is justified provided that there are no other indications for surgery (eg, suspicious adnexal mass, urinary or gastrointestinal tract obstruction) [47]. The empiric utilization of a GnRH agonist allows patients with chronic pelvic pain and a high probability of endometriosis to avoid a diagnostic surgical procedure before beginning this therapy. Doses are described below. (See 'GnRH agonists' below.)\n【33】 Placebo controlled randomized trials have confirmed the efficacy of this approach [48]. The only randomized trial that directly compared use of a GnRH agonist (goserelin) with low-dose cyclic OCs in adult women with pelvic pain associated with endometriosis showed that both drugs provided significant relief of pain, but goserelin was superior for treatment of dyspareunia [49].\n【34】 We do not utilize empiric GnRH agonists for adolescents 18 years of age or younger because we have concerns about potential adverse long-term effects on bone formation and bone mineral density [50]. Additionally, some guardians are not comfortable with a trial of empiric therapy due to worries about using a medication with adverse side effects without a definitive diagnosis. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not endorse the use of empiric GnRH agonist therapy for treatment of presumed endometriosis in young women under age 18, but considers it an option for consenting women age 18 or over [43]. Most bone mass in females has accumulated by age 18 [51].\n【35】 PATIENTS WHO FAIL THERAPY FOR DYSMENORRHEA — A definitive diagnosis of endometriosis should be established for adolescents who have persistent pain after three to six months of hormonal therapy and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the treatment of dysmenorrhea [43]. Laparoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis of endometriosis, although there has been a movement to increase the use of clinical diagnosis and treat endometriosis-associated pain without the need for a surgical diagnosis [52,53].\n【36】 When pain persists despite dysmenorrhea therapy, we talk with the adolescent and family to determine the amount of pain that is being experienced. We suggest that if the pain interferes with activities of daily life or places them at a disadvantage in academics, sports, or social activities compared with others, then we, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have classically recommended that the patient undergo laparoscopy for definitive diagnosis [43]. Typically, laparoscopy is performed after three to six months of pain [43], but waiting this long may result in pain continuing to interfere with school and social activities. Therefore, it may be necessary to proceed with laparoscopic evaluation sooner. At surgery, up to 70 percent of adolescents with chronic pelvic pain that has not responded to a trial of NSAIDs and cyclic oral contraceptive pills are found to have endometriosis [7]. These data are from studies in the early 1990s. Based on advances in laparoscopic imaging with high definition digital technology, the current rate is likely higher.\n【37】 Diagnostic (and therapeutic) laparoscopy — The gynecologic surgeon should have experience operating on patients in this age range or consult with an appropriate pediatric gynecologist or pediatric surgeon. In addition to diagnosis, surgical management of the endometriosis should be part of the primary surgery. Purely diagnostic laparoscopy followed by referral for definitive surgery should be avoided whenever possible.\n【38】 Endometriotic implants can have a variable appearance in this age group and differ from findings commonly seen in adults (picture 1) [54].\n【39】 Surgical treatment — Most adult women experience a reduction in pain after surgical treatment [61,62]. There are no large studies in adolescents. One retrospective cohort study of 85 adolescents (mean age 16.3±2.4 years) reported that pain had disappeared in 42 percent and improved in 38 percent at mean follow-up of 56 months after surgery [63]. Twenty percent reported no change or worsened pain.\n【40】 Radical excisional surgery or peritoneal stripping has not been shown to be more effective than ablation or excision in adolescents and may be associated with increased risk of adhesion formation [43,72]. Lysis of adhesions is also performed at the time of surgery. Laparotomy is rarely required. Any large endometriotic cysts should be removed, with preservation of as much ovarian tissue as possible. Care must be taken to avoid damage to the ureters, major blood vessels, bowel, and bladder. (See  \"Endometriosis: Surgical management of pelvic pain\".)\n【41】 It should be noted that no surgical procedure or medical therapy results in a cure for endometriosis. Surgery alone is not adequate treatment for endometriosis as there can be microscopic residual disease that must be suppressed with medical therapy [47]. Symptoms will return within one year in approximately 50 percent of adult women who receive only surgical therapy [47,61,66,73]. Thus, medical treatment is typically initiated postoperatively. (See 'Postoperative medical treatment' below.)\n【42】 POSTOPERATIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT — There are no long-term follow-up data describing the natural history of untreated endometriosis first detected in adolescents; we do not know the proportion of endometriosis that will progress to more advanced disease if left untreated.\n【43】 The general consensus is that adolescents with histologically confirmed endometriosis should receive hormonal medical treatment after surgical ablation/resection until they are ready to attempt pregnancy [43]. Compared with eutopic endometrium, endometriotic implants are characterized by overproduction of prostaglandins and local production of estrogens and cytokines, which synergize the activities of each other, promote implantation of ectopic endometrium, and cause the pain associated with endometriosis. The rationale for medical therapy is inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, decidualization and subsequent atrophy of residual ectopic endometrial tissue, and reduction of ovarian estrogen production, thereby inhibiting the growth and activity of the ectopic endometrium.\n【44】 The goal of medical therapy is to manage pain due to residual disease, allow the patient to function comfortably in their daily activities, and suppress disease recurrence or progression, which could impair fertility. Long-term follow-up data in adolescents show that endometriosis that is surgically identified and destroyed and then followed by medical therapy tends not to progress [24,74]. The follow-up study reported that while disease can persist following surgical resection, it does not tend to progress with surgical management followed by medical suppression. This study also reported no increase in the rates of adhesion formation from the initial surgical procedure [24]. There are limited data on the course of adolescents who undergo complete excision of visible endometriosis but do not undertake postoperative hormonal suppression [75]. It is notable that radical excisional surgery for Stage I or II superficial disease also has the risk of subsequent adhesion formation [76].\n【45】 Treatment efficacy should be assessed regularly, and we do this by asking the patient to rate their pain on a scale of 0 to 10 at each visit. We educate patients that they may not become pain free, but the medications can be adjusted to maximize pain relief and promote participation in school and social activities. Support groups for adolescents with endometriosis are available and can be useful (www.youngwomenshealth.org).\n【46】 Several medical therapies are available, each with differing risks, benefits, and side effect profiles [72,77]. The choice of treatment depends upon the severity of the patient's symptoms, the extent of disease, compliance, and need for contraception. Although numerous options have been described for the treatment of endometriosis [5,50], combination hormonal therapy or gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are usually used for first-line therapy. For adolescents with confirmed endometriosis, we offer both therapies to those ages 16 or over, but use only continuous combination hormonal and progestin-only therapies in those under 16 years of age out of concern about the effects of GnRH agonists on the formation of normal bones and bone density [78].\n【47】 Continuous hormonal therapy — Use of continuous hormonal therapy after surgery may retard progression of disease and control any remaining pain [45]. (See 'NSAIDs and hormonal therapy' above.)\n【48】 Combination estrogen-progestins — Combination therapy can be used to suppress menstruation and induce a \"pseudo-pregnancy\" state for suppression of endometriosis and endometriosis associated pain. A monophasic progestin dominant pill is most effective for the suppression of menses. It is important for adolescents to be reminded that, for this treatment to be successful, the pill must be taken at the same time daily. For many adolescents, the time they take their medication may be in the evening, as most adolescents do not get up at the same time on weekdays and weekends. If the pill is delayed or missed, there appears to be an increased risk of breakthrough bleeding.\n【49】 Progestins — Progestins inhibit endometriotic tissue growth by causing initial decidualization and eventual atrophy. They also inhibit pituitary gonadotropin secretion and ovarian hormone production, resulting in a mildly hypoestrogenic state relative to normal.\n【50】 The most commonly used progestational agents are:\n【51】 Families should be reassured that contraception may be used for noncontraceptive benefits (eg, for endometriosis) and contraception does not increase the likelihood of riskier sexual behavior [79]. However, some families of younger patients may be more interested in use of oral norethindrone acetate or medroxyprogesterone acetate, as they are not approved as contraceptive agents.\n【52】 It should be noted that although a progestin only, norethindrone acetate has been shown to be converted to a low amount of ethinyl estradiol [80].\n【53】 Each of these therapies improves symptoms in approximately 80 to 100 percent of patients with endometriosis [81-85]. Norethindrone acetate alone has been shown to be effective and well tolerated in adolescents [85]. With higher doses of norethindrone acetate (15 mg per day), liver adenomas have been reported as with combination estrogen-progestin pills, and thus, we typically use doses less than 10 mg per day [86]. The etonogestrel subdermal implant has also been used successfully, but experience is limited [87-90]. (See  \"Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain\", section on 'Progestins'.)\n【54】 Potential bothersome side effects of progestins include weight gain, bloating, depression, and unscheduled bleeding [8]; however, many patients tolerate this therapy very well [84]. Oral progestin therapy should be considered prior to long-term intramuscular injections so that side effects can be identified and addressed or the medication easily discontinued.\n【55】 The long-term utilization of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate has been shown to result in loss of bone density, which is reversible after discontinuation of the progestin.\n【56】 Progestin intrauterine devices (IUDs) deliver the progestin levonorgestrel (LNG) to the local uterine environment. Many use LNG IUDs for the treatment of dysmenorrhea and endometriosis-associated pain. No LNG IUD is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of endometriosis-associated pain. We commonly offer LNG IUD placement at the time of anesthesia for endometriosis, such as the time of laparoscopy, to potentially minimize the discomfort of pelvic examination for the adolescent. We consider the simultaneous use of systemic hormonal therapy with the IUD as patients may continue to experience bleeding and pain with the IUD is used alone for endometriosis management [91]. This is expected to inhibit ovulation more consistently, and thus reduce the risk of hemorrhagic ovarian cysts and ovarian endometriomas. The types of LNG IUDs, patient selection, insertion, and management of complications are presented separately.\n【57】 GnRH agonists — GnRH agonists can be prescribed for adolescents with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis who are at least 16 years old. While GnRH agonists are used in adolescents younger than 16 with precocious puberty, treatment duration is shorter for precocious puberty, and therefore, the outcomes and risks cannot be extrapolated to young postpubertal women with endometriosis. For GnRH therapy, our preference is depot leuprolide acetate (11.25 mg intramuscularly every three months); it is always given with add-back therapy. We use the three month formulation to improve compliance with therapy. Occasionally, some patients who receive a one-month formulation experience the expected \"flare effect\" (increased pain and bleeding) and then do not return for their second one month injection. With the three month formulation, patients who have increased pain and bleeding with the flare effect will have the GnRH agonist in their system for three months and thus continue to benefit from the subsequent suppression. Nafarelin nasal spray (one puff twice daily intranasally) is an alternative GnRH agonist, especially in younger adolescents, since the suppression appears to be less than with the intramuscular formulation. Due to the typical twice daily dosing, compliance is often unpredictable in the adolescent population. The dose can thus be titrated to less than twice daily dosing as long as estradiol levels and menses are suppressed. (See  \"Endometriosis: Long-term treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists\".)\n【58】 Over 90 percent of patients will become amenorrheic and hypoestrogenic on this dose of leuprolide [92]. Side effects of GnRH analogs without add-back therapy include hot flashes, headaches, difficulty sleeping, mood swings, depression, and vaginal dryness; therefore, we do not utilize GnRH agonist therapy without add-back therapy. Menses typically return 60 to 90 days after cessation of intramuscular leuprolide therapy.\n【59】 Generally, initial treatment with a GnRH agonist is continued for six months [93]. Upon completion of this initial six month course of GnRH agonist therapy, the patient must then choose a treatment course. One common option is a return to a continuous combined hormonal contraceptive, as described above. GnRH-agonist therapy with add-back has not been approved for use beyond 12 months by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [93], but if the patient is not able to tolerate continuous combination hormonal or progesterone only therapy, then long-term utilization of a GnRH agonist with add-back can be prescribed. A baseline bone density assessment is obtained after the initial six to nine months of therapy and is then repeated every two years. If bone density remains stable, then the assessment is repeated every two years while the patient is receiving GnRH agonists. (See 'Add-back therapy' below.)\n【60】 Add-back therapy — The utilization of add-back therapy can help alleviate the side effects of GnRH agonists without reducing their efficacy, as long as the add-back regimen does not involve high doses of estrogen [94]. Add-back therapy is based upon the \"estrogen threshold hypothesis,\" which is demonstrated in the figure (figure 2) [95]. Basically, adequate sex steroid (estrogen plus progestin, or progestin alone) is provided to prevent significant bone demineralization, but not enough to stimulate growth of endometriotic tissue.\n【61】 Options for sex steroid add-back therapy used in adult women include [96,97]:\n【62】 Patient satisfaction is higher in adult women with use of norethindrone compared with the other options (table 7) [96]. Patient satisfaction and bone density were higher in adolescent women with the use of norethindrone acetate plus conjugated equine estrogens as compared with norethindrone plus placebos [77,98,99].\n【63】 Safety — The safety of long-term use of a GnRH agonist with add-back therapy in adolescents is under investigation [78]. One study performed serial bone mineral density examinations in 36 adolescents receiving a GnRH agonist with norethindrone acetate add-back [100]. Bone density was preserved with this treatment over an 11 month mean treatment period, but preservation of bone density was better at the hip than at the spine. At the hip, 6 subjects had a BMD Z-score between -1.0 and -2.0 SD, while 2 had a Z-score ≤-2.0 SD. At the spine, 11 subjects had a BMD Z-score between -1.0 and -2.0 SD, while 3 had a Z-score ≤-2.0 SD.\n【64】 GnRH antagonists — To date, there are no studies of the use of GnRH antagonists in adolescents. Use of GnRH antagonists in adult patients is reviewed elsewhere. (See  \"Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain\", section on 'Antagonist'.)\n【65】 Danazol — Danazol is a 17-alpha-ethinyltestosterone derivative that creates an acyclic environment. Its mechanisms of action include inhibition of pituitary gonadotropin secretion, direct inhibition of endometriotic implant growth, and direct inhibition of ovarian enzymes responsible for estrogen production. (See  \"Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain\", section on 'Danazol'.)\n【66】 Those taking danazol have side effects that are dose-dependent. Side effects include weight gain, muscle cramps, decreased breast size, acne, hirsutism, oily skin, decreased high density lipoprotein levels, irreversible deepening of the voice, increased liver enzymes, hot flashes, mood changes, and depression [109]. Androgenic side effects are related to decreased sex hormone-binding globulin levels, resulting in an increase of free testosterone.\n【67】 Bothersome to intolerable side effects are a common reason for discontinuation of the drug [109]. Although GnRH agonists are also associated with side effects, patients using these drugs report a better quality of life than those taking danazol [110]. Given the side effect profile, danazol may be a desirable and well-tolerated option by gender-diverse individuals, including transgender men. Endometriosis has been laparoscopically diagnosed in transmasculine adolescents with pelvic pain while receiving testosterone therapy for gender affirmation [111].\n【68】 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents — Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are helpful adjuvant agents for the treatment of pelvic pain associated with endometriosis. In animal models of surgically induced abdominal/peritoneal endometriosis, NSAIDs differentially inhibited lesion establishment and growth, resulting in significantly reduced disease burden [112,113]. This effect may also occur in humans [114,115]. Nonsteroidal therapies, such as antiinflammatory and antiangiogenic drugs, are an emerging area of investigation in treatment of endometriosis [116]. (See  \"Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain\", section on 'Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs'.)\n【69】 MANAGEMENT OF RECURRENT PAIN — Endometriosis is a chronic and inflammatory disease, which can be progressive, thus pain can recur despite therapy. Management options for recurrent pain include:\n【70】 A long-term follow-up study reported that adolescents with early stage superficial peritoneal disease do not tend to have disease progression after surgical management followed by medical suppression [24]. That study also reported no increase in adhesion development with that technique. Radical excisional surgery for early-stage superficial peritoneal disease has been questioned to result in adhesions without proven benefit over destruction and excisional surgery [76].\n【71】 A multi-disciplinary approach to pelvic pain, with the assistance of pain treatment services and complementary and alternative therapies, should be considered in all adolescents with endometriosis. (See  \"Chronic pelvic pain in adult females: Treatment\", section on 'Nonpharmacologic therapies'.)\n【72】 Social work or similar counselor involvement may be helpful and patients with significant school absenteeism may benefit from academic accommodations. Complementary therapies that may be helpful include acupuncture [118] and pelvic floor physical therapy [119]. Physical therapy may need to be tailored to the adolescent as teens uncomfortable with vaginal insertion may need therapy techniques performed on pelvic floor musculature externally.\n【73】 SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  \"Society guideline links: Endometriosis\".)\n【74】 INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, \"The Basics\" and \"Beyond the Basics.\" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【75】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on \"patient info\" and the keyword(s) of interest.)\n【76】 In addition, there is adolescent endometriosis-specific downloadable information as handouts from the Center for Young Women's Health at Boston Children's Hospital and www.youngwomenshealth.org listed below:\n【77】 PATIENT PERSPECTIVE TOPIC — Patient perspectives are provided for selected disorders to help clinicians better understand the patient experience and patient concerns. These narratives may offer insights into patient values and preferences not included in other UpToDate topics.

{"seq_id": 1198, "text": "url: https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/desquamative-inflammatory-vaginitis-div?search=%E9%98%B4%E9%81%93%E5%88%86%E6%B3%8C%E7%89%A9&source=search_result&selectedTitle=10%7E150&usage_type=default\n【0】 脱屑性炎性阴道炎(DIV)\n【1】 ●(See  \"Vaginitis in adults: Initial evaluation\".)\n【2】 ●(See  \"Acute cervicitis\".)\n【3】 ●Possible mechanisms – Proposed underlying contributory mechanisms include estrogen deficiency, a toxic reaction to Staphylococcus aureus, an immunologic abnormality, or a combination [3,4]. Two cases of DIV that appeared to have been triggered by toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1)-producing Staphylococcus aureus strains have been reported [5].\n【4】 ●Inflammation versus infection – The author and most North American investigators believe DIV is an inflammatory vaginitis of noninfectious etiology with secondary bacterial microbiota disruption [6]. In this viewpoint, DIV is believed to be a relatively nonspecific form of immuno-inflammatory or reactive vaginitis that is multifactorial in etiology.\n【5】 Other investigators believe the disorder is due to altered vaginal flora (eg, Escherichia coli), and have termed the spectrum of findings \"aerobic vaginitis\" [7-10]. However, no consistent microbiologic pathogen has been identified except for the near absence of lactobacilli in almost all affected individuals [11].\n【6】 ●Role of dysbiosis – Profound disturbances of vaginal microbiota are uniformly found in DIV and other forms of inflammatory vaginitis. However, to date, advanced vaginal microbiome research has not revealed consistent microbial alterations or new microbial pathogens in these patients. Thus, it is suspected that the characteristic dysbiosis is the result and not the cause of DIV.\n【7】 ●Prevalence – In a prospective cohort study of 200 self-reported women with chronic vulvovaginal symptoms, 8 percent (16 out of 200) were diagnosed with DIV [12]. Those with DIV were older than the mean age (44.2 versus 38.4 years) and least likely to be menstruating. As this study group represented patients referred to a subspecialty center, the actual incidence may be higher or lower in the general population.\n【8】 ●Overlap with plasma cell vulvitis – Overlapping histopathological features have been described for DIV and plasma cell vulvitis, including epithelial thickness, rete ridge appearance exocytosis, and spongiosis [13]. This finding raises the possibility that they are different manifestations of the same underlying process.\n【9】 ●Vaginal discharge and pain – The pain and copious vaginal discharge of DIV may be accompanied by vestibular and vulvar inflammatory symptoms and signs. The pain can be described as dyspareunia, vaginal/introital pain, burning, or a combination thereof [11,12]. A diffuse exudative vaginitis and epithelial cell exfoliation results in profuse vaginal discharge (usually yellow but may be gray or green) [3]. In a series of 98 patients diagnosed with DIV (mean age 49.6 years), 70 to 90 percent had purulent vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, and vaginal inflammation [11].\n【10】 ●Symptom onset and duration – While primary DIV occurs in both pre- and post-menopausal individuals, it is more common in perimenopausal women [3,11,12]. Secondary DIV can occur in individuals of any age. In addition, those with DIV have often noted symptoms for more than one year and been treated for multiple other causes of vaginitis without relief [12].\n【11】 ●External genitalia – Normal vulvovaginal architecture is maintained. The vestibule is often affected and may be thinned, sensitive, erythematous, and/or edematous. These findings may be a result of irritation from the discharge or, more likely, due to vestibule or mucosa inflammation similar to that of the vagina.\n【12】 ●Vagina – Speculum examination of the vagina often reveals a spotty ecchymotic rash or diffuse or focal erythema or linear erosions. Copious vaginal discharge is present (usually yellow but may be gray or green).\n【13】 ●Cervix – Submucosal petechiae and erosive lesions, similar to those seen with trichomoniasis infection, may be present [17-19]. In addition, at least one case report has described DIV associated with persistent cervical ectropion [20].\n【14】 ●Other systems – There are no extra-genital findings (eg, oral lesions) on examination. No epidermal involvement occurs.\n【15】 ●Vaginal pH – Increased (>4.5).\n【16】 ●Saline wet mount microscopy – Increased number of parabasal and inflammatory cells, and the leukocyte to epithelial cell ratio is greater than 1:1 (picture 1) [3,17,19]. Parabasal cells are immature squamous epithelial cells that are rounded and have a large nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio; by contrast, mature squamous epithelial cells are larger, cuboidal, with a smaller nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio, and sometimes folded.\n【17】 ●Laboratory tests – Laboratory tests to exclude bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis are performed in all patients. Those who are sexually active are also tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. Patients with unilateral or vesicular lesions undergo testing for herpes simplex virus.\n【18】 Specific tests for these and other genital infections are discussed in detail in related content:\n【19】 ●Vaginal symptoms (at least one must be present) – vaginal discharge, dyspareunia, pruritus, burning, irritation.\n【20】 ●Vaginal inflammation (spotted ecchymotic rash, erythema, focal or linear erosion).\n【21】 ●Vaginal pH >4.5.\n【22】 ●Saline microscopy – Increased numbers of parabasal and inflammatory cells with a leukocyte to epithelial cell ratio greater than 1:1 (picture 1).\n【23】 ●Exclusion of other infectious etiologies – Bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and when indicated, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Trichomonas vaginalis infection should be excluded as etiologies (algorithm 1).\n【24】 ●Isolated vaginal discharge – Of individuals who present for evaluation of abnormal vaginal discharge, 9 percent have been reported to have physiologic vaginal discharge (ie, leukorrhea) [12]. Physiologic vaginal discharge, which is also a diagnosis of exclusion, is distinguished from DIV by a vaginal pH of 4.5 or less and normal saline microscopy. (See  \"Vaginitis in adults: Initial evaluation\", section on 'Normal vaginal discharge'.)\n【25】 ●Atrophic vaginitis – In hypoestrogenic patients, severe atrophic vaginitis can mimic DIV and microscopy findings are similar for both conditions. Improvement in symptoms with estrogen therapy helps distinguish atrophic vaginitis from DIV. (See  \"Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\".)\n【26】 ●Erosive disorders – The differential diagnosis for erosive vaginal lesions includes erosive lichen planus, pemphigus vulgaris, and cicatricial pemphigoid [17]. DIV typically occurs in perimenopausal women, while erosive lichen planus and cicatricial pemphigoid typically occur in menopausal women. (See  \"Vulvar lesions: Differential diagnosis of vesicles, bullae, erosions, and ulcers\", section on 'Erosions, excoriations, and fissures'.)\n【27】 Biopsy from the edge of an erosion or blister for histopathological examination and immunofluorescence studies are needed to confirm these other diagnoses.\n【28】 ●Dyspareunia or sexual pain – Dyspareunia or pain with sexual activity may result from atrophy related to hypoestrogenism or vaginismus; copious vaginal discharge is not typically present. Improvement in symptoms with targeted therapy (topical estrogen, pelvic floor physical therapy) helps distinguish causes of isolated sexual pain from DIV.\n【29】 ●Vaginal pain – In the absence of other findings, isolated vaginal pain may represent a centralized pain syndrome similar to that of chronic pelvic pain. (See  \"Chronic pelvic pain in adult females: Evaluation\".)\n【30】 ●Topical clindamycin – We use 2% clindamycin cream, to fill a typical applicator (approximately 5 grams containing approximately 100 mg clindamycin) intravaginally at night for four to six weeks [11]. The next steps are determined by treatment response after four to six weeks of therapy. (See 'Treatment response and follow-up' below.)\n【31】 Others use 2% clindamycin cream 4 to 5 grams (approximately one full typical applicator) intravaginally at night for one to three weeks followed by maintenance therapy once or twice a week for two to six months [19].\n【32】 OR\n【33】 ●Topical hydrocortisone – Ten percent hydrocortisone cream, 3 to 5 grams (dosed by typical vaginal applicator) intravaginally at night for four to six weeks. Ten percent hydrocortisone cream is not commercially available but can be compounded by a pharmacist. For mild disease, twice daily vaginal insertion of either hydrocortisone cream 0.5% (base) or one 25 mg rectal suppository is an option, particularly if 10% hydrocortisone cream is not available [23].\n【34】 ●Topical clobetasol gel – Clobetasol gel 0.05%, 5 gram dosed by typical applicator, applied intravaginally at night for one week [19]. In our experience, intravaginal clobetasol gel needs to be continued for several weeks to achieve treatment response and is often more expensive than the above drugs. The maximum total dose should be below 50 g per week.\n【35】 ●Vulvovaginal atrophy – Vulvovaginal atrophy, one component of genitourinary syndrome of menopause, is typically treated with low-dose topical estrogen but other treatments are available. (See  \"Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy): Treatment\".)\n【36】 ●Vulvovaginal candidiasis – Patients with documented vulvovaginal candidiasis at the time of DIV diagnosis are treated. We prefer oral fluconazole 150 mg given once to minimize the use of topical treatments that may increase skin irritation. We have found that individuals with a history of confirmed frequent vulvovaginal candidiasis may also benefit from prophylaxis with oral fluconazole 150 mg given once a week. Additional supporting data are lacking.\n【37】 ●Response – Treatment response is seen in three weeks in most (over 80 percent) of patients [11].\n【38】 ●Follow-up – The patient is re-evaluated approximately four weeks after starting therapy. Based on our experience, we advise the patient to stop using the vaginal maintenance medication approximately two to three days before evaluation; trial-based data are lacking.\n【39】 ●Retreatment – Patients who have a relapse of disease are retreated. In our experience, the following is helpful:\n【40】 ●Remission followed by reduction of drug frequency – If remission is sustained for two to three months with nightly dosing, we then reduce the medication frequency to every other night for six to eight weeks and reassess the patient.\n【41】 ●Symptom recurrence or microscopic evidence of disease – If symptoms occur or there is an increase in leukocytes and parabasal cells (even if the patient is asymptomatic), we increase the dosing frequency to the prior level that achieved the most recent remission. Once remission is again achieved, we then slowly taper, again at six- to eight-week intervals, to the lowest dose at which the patient remains in remission. The patient then continues at that dosing frequency and is reassessed. Follow-up visits are essential; the timing is variable and depends on disease response and patient amenability to the plan. In general, we initially assess the patient's response at 6- to 12-week intervals and then space out visits to three to six months.\n【42】 ●Long-term suppressive therapy – Some patients require use of suppressive therapy for months or years before it is possible to discontinue therapy without relapse. Prolonged use of intravaginal clindamycin has not been associated with colitis and 10% hydrocortisone does not cause adrenal suppression. However, as safety data specific to patients with a history of C. difficile infection are lacking, we favor hydrocortisone treatment rather than clindamycin for these individuals [24]. We do not suggest routine prophylaxis against vulvovaginal candidiasis in these patients.\n【43】 ●Lack of response – For individuals whose symptoms or microscopic findings do not respond to either clindamycin or hydrocortisone, treatment with the immunosuppressant tacrolimus is an option. Tacrolimus 0.03% (prescribed as 30 or 60 g tube) is applied sparingly into the vagina with a finger twice daily. Alternately, clobetasol 0.05% applied twice daily may be useful [23]. Once clinical remission has been achieved, the patient is reassessed in six- to eight-week intervals and the drug frequency is slowly tapered as above.\n【44】 ●Beyond the Basics topics (see  \"Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adult women (Beyond the Basics)\" and  \"Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)\" and  \"Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)\")\n【45】 ●Etiology – Desquamative inflammatory vaginitis (DIV) appears to be an inflammatory vaginitis of noninfectious etiology with secondary bacterial microbiota disruption. However, some investigators have attributed the primary defect to altered vaginal flora (eg, E. coli) and have termed the spectrum of findings \"aerobic vaginitis.\" No consistent microbiologic pathogen has been identified except for the near absence of lactobacilli in almost all patients. (See 'Pathogenesis and epidemiology' above.)\n【46】 ●Clinical presentation – Patients with DIV present with nonspecific findings of purulent vaginal discharge, vulvovaginal burning or irritation, dyspareunia, and vulvar and vaginal erythema. Affected individuals are often in the perimenopausal or menopausal periods. The clinical presentation is the same for primary (ie, idiopathic) and secondary (drug or immune-mediated) DIV.\n【47】 ●Diagnostic evaluation – Individuals who present with an alteration in vaginal discharge (qualitative or quantitative) are evaluated with a history, physical examination, and appropriate laboratory tests, such as pH and microscopy. Other causes of vaginal discharge and pain, particularly infectious etiologies (eg, bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis), need to be excluded (algorithm 1). (See 'Diagnostic evaluation' above.)\n【48】 ●Diagnosis – The diagnosis requires all of the following criteria (see 'Diagnosis' above):\n【49】 ●Differential diagnosis – DIV is a diagnosis of exclusion. The differential diagnosis includes severe atrophic vaginitis, erosive lichen planus, pemphigus vulgaris, and cicatricial pemphigoid. (See 'Differential diagnosis' above.)\n【50】 ●Treatment – The two most common treatments are intravaginal clindamycin or glucocorticoids. Trials evaluating treatment approaches are lacking.\n【51】 ●Relapse – For patients who relapse after discontinuation of primary treatment, we treat with the drug that was not used for their initial treatment (clindamycin instead of hydrocortisone or vice versa). This drug is continued until complete remission is again achieved and then tapered gradually.

Anaphylaxis may present as respiratory distress, hypoxia, hypotension, urticaria, and/or tongue/throat angioedema. Monitor closely during and after infusion. Appropriate medical support should be readily available. Patients with compromised respiratory function or acute respiratory disease are at risk of respiratory disease exacerbation due to hypersensitivity; additional monitoring may be required. Discontinue immediately if anaphylactic or acute reaction occurs. Patients experiencing initial severe or refractory reactions may need prolonged monitoring. Antihistamines, corticosteroids and/or decreased infusion rates may be used to manage subsequent infusions.\n【47】 • Antibody formation: Development of anti-idursulfase IgG antibodies has been reported in 51% of patients; may increase incidence of hypersensitivity reactions.\n【48】 • Acute febrile/respiratory illness: Hypersensitivity reactions may occur. Use caution and consider delaying treatment in patients with compromised respiratory function or acute febrile or respiratory illness; may be at increased risk for life-threatening complications from hypersensitivity reactions.\n【49】 • Fluid overload: Use with caution in patients at risk for fluid overload or in conditions where fluid restriction is indicated (eg, acute underlying respiratory illness, compromised cardiac and/or respiratory function); conditions may be exacerbated during infusion. Extended observation may be necessary for some patients.\n【50】 • Genetic mutations: Use with caution in patients with severe genetic mutations (eg, complete gene deletion, large gene rearrangement, nonsense, frameshift or splice site mutations); may increase risk of hypersensitivity reactions, serious adverse reactions, and antibody development.\n【51】 • Registry: Patients and healthcare providers are encouraged to participate in the Hunter Outcome Survey, intended to monitor disease progression, patient outcomes, and long-term effects of therapy. For more information, refer to www.elaprase.com or call OnePathsm at 1-866-888-0660.\n【52】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【53】 When compared to pediatric patients >7 years, the patients ≤7 years of age were shown to have more frequent development of anti-idursulfase IgG antibodies (68% vs 51%) and neutralizing antibodies (79% vs 41%). In patients <5 years of age, an association between the presence of antibodies and reduced systemic idursulfase exposure has been observed; this has not been reported in older pediatric patients (≥5 years of age). Younger pediatric patients have also been shown to develop neutralizing antibodies earlier in therapy (at week 9 vs 27) and at higher titers.\n【54】 Dosage Forms: US\n【55】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【56】 Solution, Intravenous [preservative free]:\n【57】 Elaprase: 6 mg/3 mL (3 mL)\n【58】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【59】 No\n【60】 Pricing: US\n【61】 6 mg/3 mL (per mL): $1,254.33\n【62】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【63】 Solution, Intravenous:\n【64】 Administration: Pediatric\n【65】 IV: Administer using an infusion set containing a 0.2 micron low protein-binding inline filter.

Rate may be decreased, temporarily stopped, or discontinued based on tolerance. Initial infusion should be over 3 hours; if tolerated, subsequent infusions may be gradually reduced to a 1-hour infusion. Total infusion time should not exceed 8 hours. Note: For subsequent doses, current guidelines suggest that shortened infusion time of 1 hour is not desirable and increased the risk of infusion-related reaction; extra precautions should be used (Scarpa 2011).\n【66】 Administration: Adult\n【67】 IV: Administer using an infusion set containing a 0.2 micron low protein-binding inline filter. Infuse at an initial rate of 8 mL/hour for the first 15 minutes. If tolerated, may increase rate by 8 mL/hour increments every 15 minutes; maximum infusion rate of up to 100 mL/hour. Rate may be decreased, temporarily stopped, or discontinued based on tolerance. Initial infusion should be over 3 hours; if tolerated, subsequent infusions may be gradually reduced to a 1-hour infusion. Total infusion time should not exceed 8 hours.\n【68】 Storage/Stability\n【69】 Store vials under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Protect from light, do not freeze or shake.

Although the swelling is self-limited, laryngeal involvement may cause fatal asphyxiation. Prior to the availability of effective therapy, this disorder was associated with a mortality rate of approximately 30 percent due to asphyxiation from laryngeal swelling.\n【2】 The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, triggering and exacerbating factors, and prognosis of HAE are discussed in this topic review. The laboratory evaluation, establishing definitive diagnosis, and acute and prophylactic therapies of this disorder are discussed separately:\n【3】 ●(See  \"Hereditary angioedema (due to C1 inhibitor deficiency): Pathogenesis and diagnosis\".)\n【4】 ●(See  \"Hereditary angioedema: Acute treatment of angioedema attacks\".)\n【5】 ●(See  \"Hereditary angioedema (due to C1 inhibitor deficiency): General care and long-term prophylaxis\".)\n【6】 Terminology — HAE types I and II are the focus of this topic review. These disorders are caused by deficiency or dysfunction of the C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) protein. They are referred to as HAE-C1-INH or simply HAE in this review.\n【7】 HAE with normal C1-INH (also called type III HAE) is a clinically similar disorder, seen mostly in women, in which C1-INH is normal. Some patients have mutations in factor XII, plasminogen, angiopoietin 1, or kininogen 1. This disorder is discussed separately. (See  \"Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor\".)\n【8】 EPIDEMIOLOGY — The prevalence of HAE is estimated at approximately 1 individual per 60,000 [1,2]. Males and females are affected equally, and there are no known differences in prevalence among ethnic groups [3-5].\n【9】 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\n【10】 Age of onset — The age at which attacks begin is variable, with rare reports of initial episodes of angioedema in the perinatal period [6]. Approximately 40 percent of patients experience their first HAE attack before age 5, and 75 percent, by age 15, although repeated attacks in preadolescent children are uncommon [6-9]. Thus, for the majority of patients, the disease first presents in childhood or adolescence. The time of the onset of the initial symptoms does not differ between boys and girls [10,11]. Attack frequency usually increases after puberty. In most cases, the diagnosis is eventually made in the second or third decade of life and can be further delayed if there is no family history.\n【11】 Laboratory findings — Patients with HAE with C1 inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency demonstrate characteristic abnormalities in the complement system, upon which the diagnosis is based. These are discussed in detail separately. (See  \"Hereditary angioedema (due to C1 inhibitor deficiency): Pathogenesis and diagnosis\".)\n【12】 Other than abnormal complement studies, patients with HAE are usually healthy and most commonly have normal routine laboratory values, although hypergammaglobulinemia has been noted in some patients [12,13].\n【13】 Characteristic features of angioedema attacks — Attacks most often affect three anatomical locations:\n【14】 ●The skin (cutaneous attacks)\n【15】 ●The gastrointestinal tract (gastrointestinal attacks)\n【16】 ●The upper airway\n【17】 Many HAE attacks involve only one site at a time, although multilocational attacks may also occur. HAE attacks are always self-limited, lasting two to five days, and range in severity from inconvenient cutaneous swelling to life-threatening upper airway edema [14,15]. Approximately 50 percent of patients experience all three manifestations during the course of their lives [7]. Other general observations about HAE include the following:\n【18】 ●HAE attack frequency varies from weekly to one or two episodes per year [15]. Untreated, patients with frequent attacks may miss up in excess of 100 work days per year [7]. A few subjects remain asymptomatic and are identified as having HAE only as a result of family screening [6,16].\n【19】 ●Disease severity differs markedly among affected members within families, despite the presence of the same mutation [6]. Disease severity may also vary significantly in the same patient over time. The factors determining disease severity are unknown.\n【20】 Prodromal symptoms and skin changes — Prodromal symptoms include fatigue, nausea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, and myalgias and flu-like symptoms [17,18]. Some patients develop skin changes that are usually described as a serpentine, mottled, and/or \"chicken-wire\" pattern of erythematous discoloration (picture 1) [19-22]. Erythema marginatum occurs in approximately 42 to 58 percent of cases [19,23,24]. Prodromal symptoms usually occur within 24 hours before the onset of angioedema, although not all prodromal symptoms are followed by an angioedema episode [18].\n【21】 Cutaneous attacks — Cutaneous attacks are common and temporarily disfiguring, although not generally dangerous. Skin swelling was present in 97 percent of 131,110 angioedema episodes in a retrospective series of 221 patients [6]. The extremities, face, and genitals are most commonly affected, although any site can be involved (picture 2). Swelling occurs in nondependent areas and is not pitting or pruritic. Cutaneous attacks are often associated with pain and dysfunction in addition to swelling [25]. An episode typically begins in the skin with a peculiar tingling or sensation of fullness and irritation, followed by swelling and a sense of tightness in the next two to three hours. The angioedema builds over the first 24 hours, then gradually subsides over 48 to 72 hours [26]. Swelling may last up to five days in some patients. Attacks can also last longer if the swelling spreads from one site to another.\n【22】 Face and lips — Angioedema of the face and lips comprises approximately 3 percent of the episodes of subcutaneous edema. Swelling in these areas should be monitored closely by the patient, because up to 30 percent of episodes of upper airway edema are preceded by facial/labial edema [26].\n【23】 Upper airway attacks — Laryngeal swelling can occur in isolation, or in association with swelling of the lips, tongue, uvula, and soft palate [6]. Initial signs and symptoms of upper airway attacks may include: a sore, scratchy, or itchy throat, the sensation of tightness or a lump in the throat, dysphagia, voice changes, hoarseness, roughness of voice, or a resonant, \"barky\" cough [27].\n【24】 Laryngeal edema occurs in approximately one-half of all patients over their lifetimes; however, only a few percent experience recurrent episodes, and in the large retrospective series mentioned above, laryngeal attacks accounted for less than 1 percent of all angioedema episodes [6]. Laryngeal attacks are less common in patients over the age of 45 [26]. Tooth extraction and oral surgery are common triggers. (See 'Triggers and exacerbating factors' below.)\n【25】 Laryngeal swelling usually develops over hours, with a reported mean of seven hours [28]. However, there are disturbing reports of fulminant laryngeal attacks, including a nine-year-old boy with a family history of HAE, but no previous attacks, who died of asphyxiation 20 minutes after the apparent onset of symptoms [28-30]. In comparison to adults, asphyxia may ensue more rapidly in children because of smaller airway diameter [31]. Although each laryngeal attack has the potential to become life-threatening, the majority resolve before complete airway obstruction, and one large series documented only two intubations and four cricothyrotomies among 342 laryngeal attacks [26].\n【26】 In a study of 70 fatal laryngeal attacks, researchers proposed that three phases of an attack can be distinguished [30]:\n【27】 ●The predyspnea phase, which starts with the first noticeable symptom and ends when dyspnea develops (average length, 3.7 hours, range 0 to 11 hours). During this phase, patients typically reported the initial symptoms, but not frank dyspnea. Six patients did not appear to have a predyspnea phase at all, as their initial symptom was dyspnea.\n【28】 ●The dyspnea phase, from onset of dyspnea to loss of consciousness (average length 41 minutes, range 2 minutes to 4 hours).\n【29】 ●The loss of consciousness phase, which starts with loss of consciousness and ends with death (average length 9 minutes, range 2 to 20 minutes).\n【30】 Thus, there is a window of opportunity in the predyspnea phase in which patients can seek and receive help, followed by a much shorter period in the dyspnea phase. In this study, 63 patients had not been diagnosed with HAE at the time of death, and 7 had. Possible triggers were apparent in a minority of patients (eight had preceding upper respiratory tract infections and six had tooth extractions). The mean age of death by asphyxiation in undiagnosed patients was 40.6 years.\n【31】 Gastrointestinal attacks — Gastrointestinal attacks present as varying degrees of gastrointestinal colic, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea [32]. These symptoms result from bowel wall edema. Gastrointestinal attacks are experienced by a majority of patients with HAE-C1-INH and can be the principal presentation in one-quarter of patients [6,15]. A few families have been reported in which bowel attacks were the only manifestation.\n【32】 Symptoms and patterns of symptom development were analyzed in a large, mostly retrospective, observational study of over 33,000 gastrointestinal attacks in 153 patients with HAE, [33]. The patients included in this series had received treatment with analgesics or spasmolytics only. At least one prodromal symptom occurred at the onset of 70 percent of the attacks, and included fatigue, irritability, hunger, sensitivity to noise, and erythema marginatum. All attacks were painful, with a mean pain score of 8.4 on a subjective scale of 1 (minimal) to 10 (maximal). Three-quarters included nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension, and 41 percent involved diarrhea. Four percent of patients experienced circulatory collapse, which can result from hypovolemia. Attacks lasted four days on average, from the onset of prodromal symptoms to complete resolution, and peaked on the second day.\n【33】 Gastrointestinal attacks can be challenging to diagnose and the clinician must determine if the abdominal symptoms are due to angioedema or to an unrelated process. Recurrent abdominal complaints of unknown etiology should always raise the suspicion of HAE. Patients who have had previous gastrointestinal attacks should be questioned carefully to ascertain if their current symptoms are similar to past episodes. Because of the clinical similarities between bowel attacks of angioedema and true surgical emergencies, as many as one-third of patients with undiagnosed HAE may undergo unwarranted abdominal surgery [7,34].\n【34】 Objective findings\n【35】 ●Most abdominal attacks are not associated with fever, peritoneal signs, or an elevated white blood cell count. However, during severe abdominal attacks, elevations of neutrophils (without increased bands), hypovolemia from fluid losses, or hemoconcentration from plasma extravasation and/or vasodilation have been reported [35-37]. Neutrophils have been reported to be elevated and activated but without a left shift (ie, without an increase in bands) [37,38].\n【36】 ●Imaging is not routinely needed during an abdominal attack in a patient with known HAE who is reporting characteristic symptoms. However, if the cause of the patient's presentation is unclear, an abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan is useful in confirming the findings of gastrointestinal angioedema. Ultrasound findings include edema of the intestinal wall and free peritoneal fluid, which resolve after the attack. Although not specific to HAE, these findings can be a sensitive, rapid, and non-invasive means of excluding other disorders [37,39,40].\n【37】 Unusual manifestations of hereditary angioedema — Unusual forms of HAE attacks include episodic swelling of the bladder and urethra, pancreatic duct, gallbladder, circumscribed induration of muscles, chest tightness or pain, renal colic, cephalalgia, joint swelling, and pleural or pericardial fluid accumulations [6,41]. There is sometimes accompanying or preceding cutaneous swelling.\n【38】 Associated conditions — Most patients with HAE are otherwise healthy. However, the following conditions are reported in association with HAE in some individuals:\n【39】 ●Depression: Those with severe or frequent HAE attacks have impaired quality of life and may suffer from depression [42,43].\n【40】 ●Pancreatitis: Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients with HAE, although it is not clear if the two disorders are pathologically related [12,44-51]. Although HAE attacks are rarely associated with pancreatitis, a review of literature suggested that HAE (due to mutations in either C1-INH or factor XII) should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with idiopathic pancreatitis [52].\n【41】 ●Celiac disease: A higher prevalence of celiac disease is observed among patients with HAE compared with the general population (18.1 versus 1.2 percent) [53].\n【42】 ●Autoimmunity: There appears to be an association between HAE and both autoimmune diseases and enhanced autoantibody production. Autoimmune conditions were reported in 19 of 157 patients (12 percent) in one series of patients with HAE [12]. Associated disorders include thyroiditis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren's syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, glomerulonephritis, and a nonrheumatoid erosive arthritis of the wrists and hips [54-56]. It has been proposed that the depressed levels of C4 seen in patients with HAE may contribute to the development of autoimmune disease, since C4 is important in the solubilization and clearance of immune complexes [57,58]. Chronic overactivation of B cells (as determined by heightened expression of toll-like receptor 9), has also been demonstrated [59]. High rates of positivity for antinuclear antibodies were found in two series (16 and 28 percent, compared with 5 percent in the general population) [59,60].\n【43】 TRIGGERS AND EXACERBATING FACTORS — Patients report a variety of triggers for episodes of angioedema. Stress (either mental or physical) and dental procedures are the most common.\n【44】 Physical triggers — Mild trauma, including dental work, is a common trigger and will precipitate episodes of angioedema in many patients. Intubation is another important trigger. Prophylaxis for prevention of attacks associated with dental work or surgery is discussed elsewhere. (See  \"Hereditary angioedema (due to C1 inhibitor deficiency): General care and long-term prophylaxis\".)\n【45】 Tongue-piercing and snoring-induced local trauma of the soft palate have been implicated in isolated case reports [61,62]. Genital swelling in women can be precipitated by sexual intercourse, as well as bicycle or horse riding [63]. The reason one type of insult precipitates attacks, while another does not, is poorly understood.\n【46】 Infections and other stressors — Other triggers that have been reported (although not all necessarily validated) include excitement, sleep deprivation, viral upper respiratory tract infections, bacteriuria, cold exposure, prolonged sitting or standing, ingestion of certain foods, and menstruation [57,64,65].\n【47】 Medications — The following medications can exacerbate the frequency and/or severity of HAE attacks:\n【48】 ●Estrogen-containing medications, such as hormone replacement therapy and contraceptives [68]. (See 'Hormonal changes in women' below.)\n【49】 ●Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) that has mixed agonist/antagonist actions on the estrogen receptor. In one reported case, a patient with HAE who developed increased episodes on tamoxifen was successfully treated with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole [69].\n【50】 ●Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors [64]. In contrast, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are generally well-tolerated.\n【51】 Hormonal changes in women — The impact of hormonal fluctuations, including pregnancy, on women with HAE is variable [23,70-73]. The largest study was a retrospective questionnaire-based survey of 150 postpubertal women with HAE (both on and off therapy) from eight European countries, which reported the following observations [71]:\n【52】 ●Disease worsened with puberty in 62 percent and did not change for the others.\n【53】 ●Attacks were associated with the perimenstrual or menstrual period in 35 percent.\n【54】 ●Use of oral contraceptives containing both estrogen and progesterone worsened disease severity in 80 percent of respondents. In contrast, progesterone-only contraceptives improved disease in 64 percent. Intrauterine devices were well-tolerated by 83 percent.\n【55】 ●Pregnancy was associated with more attacks in 38 percent, fewer in 30 percent, and no change in 32 percent [71]. Most women reported that the effects during an initial pregnancy were similar in subsequent pregnancies. Women who had attacks in association with menses were more likely to have worsening of disease during pregnancy, indicating that a subset of women is particularly sensitive to hormonal triggers [74].\n【56】 ●Delivery did not precipitate attacks in most women, as noted in other studies [23,72]. The majority (89 percent) were not given prophylactic treatment in preparation for delivery, and yet attacks during or within two days of delivery occurred in only 6 percent.\n【57】 ●Of the 29 percent of participants who had experienced menopause, 55 percent noticed no change in disease activity. A worsening of attacks was reported by 32 percent.\n【58】 ●There were no detectable differences in the rates of gynecologic disease, infertility, or spontaneous abortion in women with HAE compared with those in the general population.\n【59】 Another study followed 22 women with HAE through 35 pregnancies and found an increase in attack rates during pregnancy or in the postpartum period in 83 percent [73]. All women received replacement C1 inhibitor therapy during pregnancy and just prior to delivery, and none experienced attacks during labor or delivery. These patients were followed at a referral center, and so the severity of their disease may have been greater than that of patients with HAE treated elsewhere.\n【60】 Recommendations for the gynecologic and obstetric care of women with HAE are reviewed elsewhere. (See  \"Hereditary angioedema (due to C1 inhibitor deficiency): General care and long-term prophylaxis\", section on 'Gynecologic and obstetric care'.)\n【61】 PROGNOSIS — The prognosis for patients with HAE-C1-INH is variable. Once attacks have begun, they generally continue throughout the patient's life, although the frequency of attacks can be dramatically reduced by therapy.\n【62】 Prior to the introduction of effective therapies for HAE, up to one-third of patients died of asphyxiation [23]. However, despite effective therapies, deaths secondary to laryngeal attacks still occur with some regularity, although data are limited. A series of Austrian, Swiss, and German patients published in 2004 cited a mortality rate as high as 13 percent [57].\n【63】 SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  \"Society guideline links: Hereditary angioedema and other forms of nonhistaminergic angioedema\".)\n【64】 SUMMARY — Hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency (abbreviated here as HAE-C1-INH or simply HAE) is a rare disorder characterized clinically by recurrent episodes of angioedema, without accompanying hives or pruritus, which most commonly affect the skin, bowel, or upper airway. (See 'Introduction' above.)\n【65】 ●HAE affects men and women equally. There are no known racial predilections. Although symptoms often begin in childhood, the disease is commonly diagnosed during puberty or early adulthood, when attacks become more frequent and show inter- and intraindividual differences. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)\n【66】 ●An attack of HAE usually involves one site at a time (skin, upper airway, or gastrointestinal tract). A prodrome of fatigue or erythematous rash is noticed by some patients. Attacks build in severity for 24 hours and then subside over the next 24 to 72 hours. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above.)\n【67】 ●The most life-threatening type of attack involves the upper airway, and any swelling in this area should be regarded as an emergency. Laryngeal attacks usually develop over hours, but there are reports of precipitous airway closure. Laryngeal edema occurs in approximately one-half of all patients over their lifetimes, although only a few percent experience recurrent episodes. (See 'Upper airway attacks' above.)\n【68】 ●Cutaneous attacks are common and temporarily disfiguring, although not generally dangerous. The extremities, face, and genitals are most commonly affected, although any site can be involved (picture 2). Swelling occurs in nondependent areas and is nonpitting. (See 'Cutaneous attacks' above.)\n【69】 ●Gastrointestinal attacks are experienced by a majority of patients with HAE and present as varying degrees of gastrointestinal colic, nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea, which result from bowel wall edema. (See 'Gastrointestinal attacks' above.)\n【70】 ●Mild trauma, including dental work, is the most common trigger for cutaneous and laryngeal attacks. Other triggers that have been reported include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, stress, exogenous estrogens, and changes in sex hormones (menstruation, pregnancy). (See 'Triggers and exacerbating factors' above.)\n【71】 ●Once attacks have begun, they generally continue throughout the patient's life, although the frequency of attacks can be dramatically reduced by therapy. The mortality rate for patients with HAE, despite effective therapies, has been estimated to be as high as 13 percent. (See 'Prognosis' above.)\n【72】 ACKNOWLEDGMENT — The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Marco Cicardi, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.", "title": "遗传性血管性水肿：流行病学、临床表现、恶化因素和预后", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis?search=%E7%9A%AE%E8%82%A4%E9%BA%BB%E5%88%BA%E6%84%9F&source=search_result&selectedTitle=3%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

Frequency not defined. Toxicity depends on duration of treatment and/or rate of administration.\n【36】 Cardiovascular: Angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac failure, cerebrovascular accident, ischemic heart disease, local thrombophlebitis, myocardial infarction, vasospasm, ventricular ectopy\n【37】 Central nervous system: Cerebellar syndrome (acute), confusion, disorientation, euphoria, headache\n【38】 Dermatologic: Alopecia, changes in nails (including nail loss), dermatitis, hyperpigmentation (supravenous), maculopapular rash (pruritic), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, skin fissure, skin photosensitivity, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, xeroderma\n【39】 Gastrointestinal: Anorexia, diarrhea, esophagopharyngitis, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastrointestinal ulcer, mesenteric ischemia (acute), nausea, stomatitis, tissue sloughing (gastrointestinal), vomiting\n【40】 Hematologic & oncologic: Agranulocytosis, anemia, leukopenia (nadir: days 9 to 14; recovery by day 30), pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia\n【41】 Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity reaction (generalized)\n【42】 Ophthalmic: Lacrimal stenosis, lacrimation, nystagmus, photophobia, visual disturbance\n【43】 Respiratory: Epistaxis\n【44】 <1%, postmarketing, and/or case reports: Dysgeusia (Syed 2016)\n【45】 Contraindications\n【46】 There are no contraindications listed in the manufacturer’s US labeling.\n【47】 Warnings/Precautions\n【48】 • Bone marrow suppression: Fluorouracil can cause severe and fatal hematologic toxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia). The neutrophil nadir usually occurs between 9 to 14 days after administration.\n【49】 • Cardiotoxicity: Based on postmarketing reports, fluorouracil may cause cardiotoxicity (angina, MI/ischemia, arrhythmia, and heart failure). Risk factors for cardiotoxicity include continuous infusion administration (versus IV bolus) and coronary artery disease. The risks of resuming fluorouracil in patients with resolved cardiotoxicity have not been established. In a scientific statement from the American Heart Association, fluorouracil has been determined to be an agent that may either cause reversible direct myocardial toxicity or exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction (magnitude: moderate/major) (AHA [Page 2016]).\n【50】 • GI toxicity: Fluorouracil is associated with severe diarrhea. Mucositis, stomatitis, or esophagopharyngitis (which may lead to mucosal sloughing or ulceration) may occur with fluorouracil. The incidence of mucositis is reported to be higher with IV bolus fluorouracil administration (vs continuous infusion).\n【51】 • Hand-foot syndrome: Fluorouracil is associated with palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (hand-foot syndrome; HFS). Symptoms of HFS include a tingling sensation, pain, swelling, erythema with tenderness, and desquamation. HFS occurs more commonly when fluorouracil is administered as a continuous infusion (compared to IV bolus) and has been reported to occur more frequently in patients with prior chemotherapy exposure. The onset of HFS is usually after 8 to 9 weeks of fluorouracil, although may occur earlier.\n【52】 • Hyperammonemic encephalopathy: Fluorouracil may result in hyperammonemic encephalopathy in the absence of liver disease or other identifiable cause (postmarketing reports). The onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy signs/symptoms (altered mental status, confusion, disorientation, coma, or ataxia, in the presence of concomitant elevated serum ammonia level) was within 72 hours after fluorouracil infusion initiation. The risks of resuming fluorouracil in patients with resolved hyperammonemic encephalopathy have not been established.\n【53】 • Neurotoxicity: Fluorouracil may cause neurologic toxicity, including acute cerebellar syndrome and other neurologic events (postmarketing reports). Neurologic symptoms included confusion, disorientation, ataxia, or visual disturbances. There are insufficient data on the risks of resuming fluorouracil in patients with resolved neurologic toxicity.\n【54】 • Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency: Patients with select homozygous or compound heterozygous dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) gene mutations that result in complete or near complete absence of DPD activity are at increased risk for acute early-onset of toxicity and severe, life-threatening, or fatal adverse reactions (eg, mucositis, diarrhea, neutropenia, neurotoxicity) due to fluorouracil. Patients with partial DPD activity may also have increased risk of severe, life-threatening, or fatal adverse reactions when administered fluorouracil. Based on clinical assessment of toxicity onset, duration, and severity, withhold or permanently discontinue fluorouracil in patients with evidence of acute early-onset or unusually severe toxicity, which may indicate near complete or total absence of DPD activity. There is no fluorouracil dose that has been proven safe in patients with complete absence of DPD activity and data are insufficient to recommend a specific dose in patients with partial DPD activity as measured by any specific test.\n【55】 • Warfarin: Clinically significant coagulation parameter elevations have been reported with concomitant use of warfarin and fluorouracil. Closely monitor INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving concomitant coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin and adjust the anticoagulant dose accordingly.\n【56】 • Administration safety issues: Serious errors have occurred when doses administered by continuous ambulatory infusion pumps have inadvertently been given over 1 to 4 hours instead of the intended extended continuous infusion duration. Depending on protocol, infusion duration may range from 46 hours to 7 days for fluorouracil continuous infusions. Ambulatory pumps utilized for continuous infusions should have safeguards to allow for detection of programming errors. If using an elastomeric device for ambulatory continuous infusion, carefully select the device and double check the flow rate. Appropriate prescribing (in single daily doses [not course doses] with instructions to infuse over a specific time period), appropriate training/certification/education of staff involved with dispensing and administration processes, and independent double checks should be utilized throughout dispensing and administration procedures (ISMP [Smetzer 2015]).\n【57】 • Antidote: Uridine triacetate has been studied in cases of fluorouracil overdose. In a clinical study of 98 patients who received uridine triacetate for fluorouracil toxicity (due to overdose, accidental capecitabine ingestion, or possible DPD deficiency), 96 patients recovered fully (Bamat 2013). Of 17 patients receiving uridine triacetate beginning within 8 to 96 hours after fluorouracil overdose, all patients fully recovered (von Borstel 2009). Refer to Uridine Triacetate monograph.\n【58】 Dosage Forms: US\n【59】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Stability of fluorouracil 1 mg/mL or 10 mg/mL in NS or D5W in PVC bags was demonstrated for up to 14 days at 4°C (39.2°F) and 21°C (69.8°F) (Martel 1996). Stability of undiluted fluorouracil (50 mg/mL) in ethylene vinyl acetate ambulatory pump reservoirs was demonstrated for 3 days at 4°C (39.2°F) (precipitate formed after 3 days) and for 14 days at 33°C (91.4°F) (Martel 1996). Stability of undiluted fluorouracil (50 mg/mL) in PVC ambulatory pump reservoirs was demonstrated for 5 days at 4°C (39.2°F) (precipitate formed after 5 days) and for 14 days at 33°C (91.4°F) (Martel 1996).

Risk X: Avoid combination\n【192】 Dietary Considerations\n【193】 Increase dietary intake of thiamine.\n【194】 Reproductive Considerations\n【195】 Patients who could become pregnant and patients with partners who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months following cessation of fluorouracil therapy.\n【196】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【197】 Based on the mechanism of action and available human data, fluorouracil may cause fetal harm if administered during pregnancy (NTP 2013). Use in the first trimester is not recommended (Silverstein 2020).\n【198】 The European Society for Medical Oncology has published guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of cancer during pregnancy. The guidelines recommend referral to a facility with expertise in cancer during pregnancy and encourage a multidisciplinary team (obstetrician, neonatologist, oncology team). In general, if chemotherapy is indicated, it should be avoided during in the first trimester, there should be a 3-week time period between the last chemotherapy dose and anticipated delivery, and chemotherapy should not be administered beyond week 33 of gestation (ESMO [Peccatori 2013]).\n【199】 A long-term observational research study is collecting information about the diagnosis and treatment of cancer during pregnancy. For additional information about the pregnancy and cancer registry or to become a participant, contact Cooper Health (1-877-635-4499).\n【200】 Monitoring Parameters\n【201】 CBC with differential and platelet count, renal function tests, liver function tests; signs of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, stomatitis, diarrhea, hemorrhage, or gastrointestinal ulcers or bleeding\n【202】 Mechanism of Action\n【203】 Fluorouracil is a pyrimidine analog antimetabolite that interferes with DNA and RNA synthesis; after activation, F-UMP (an active metabolite) is incorporated into RNA to replace uracil and inhibit cell growth; the active metabolite F-dUMP, inhibits thymidylate synthetase, depleting thymidine triphosphate (a necessary component of DNA synthesis).\n【204】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【205】 Distribution: Fluorouracil distributes throughout the body, including brain tissue, CSF, bone marrow, intestinal mucosa, and liver.\n【206】 Metabolism: Hepatic; via a dehydrogenase enzyme; FU must be metabolized to form active metabolites, 5-fluoroxyuridine monophosphate (F-UMP) and 5-5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine-5’-O-monophosphate (F-dUMP)\n【207】 Half-life elimination: Following bolus infusion: 8 to 20 minutes\n【208】 Excretion: Urine (5% to 20% as unchanged drug within 6 hours; metabolites over 3 to 4 hours)\n【209】 Brand Names: International\n【210】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Fluorouracil (systemic)  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/fluorouracil-systemic-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E8%90%A5%E5%85%BB%E7%BC%BA%E4%B9%8F%E6%BA%90%E6%80%A7%E7%A5%9E%E7%BB%8F%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E9%9A%9C%E7%A2%8D&source=search_result&selectedTitle=92%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

(See  \"Multiple myeloma: Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Diagnostic criteria'.)\n【11】 ●Differentiation from MGUS – SMM is differentiated from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) based on the size of the M protein and the level of bone marrow involvement (table 2 and table 3). It is considered a separate premalignant entity because the risk of progression is much higher than with MGUS especially during the first five years (10 percent per year for the first five years versus 1 percent per year, respectively). As a result, patients with SMM need more frequent follow-up compared with patients with MGUS, at least during the first five years.\n【12】 ●Differentiation from MM – SMM is differentiated from MM based on either the presence of end-organ damage or on the presence of at least one of the three biomarkers described above that accurately identify a subset of patients who are at imminent risk of developing end-organ damage (table 2 and table 1). If there are doubts about the differentiation of MGUS/SMM from MM and whether to begin treatment, one should re-evaluate in two or three months. Importantly, to be considered a criterion for the diagnosis of MM, the end-organ damage must be due to the plasma cell disorder. Examples of comorbidities that may mimic end-organ damage include kidney impairment related to hypertension or diabetes and anemia due to iron or vitamin deficiency. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"Multiple myeloma: Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Diagnostic criteria'.)\n【13】 The management of MM and indications for treatment are presented in more detail separately. (See  \"Multiple myeloma: Overview of management\", section on 'Verify the diagnosis'.)\n【14】 ●10 percent per year for the first five years\n【15】 ●3 percent per year for the next five years\n【16】 ●1 to 2 percent per year for the following 10 years\n【17】 ●Bone marrow plasma cells >20 percent\n【18】 ●Monoclonal (M) protein >2 g/dL\n【19】 ●Involved/uninvolved free light chain (FLC) ratio >20\n【20】 ●High risk (two or three factors present) – Estimated median time to progression (TTP) 29 months; estimated risk of progression of 24 percent per year during the first two years, 11 percent per year for the next three years, and 3 percent per year for the next five years.\n【21】 ●Intermediate risk (one factor present) – Estimated median TTP 68 months; estimated rate of progression of 15 percent per year during the first two years, 7 percent per year for the next three years, and 4 percent per year for the next five years.\n【22】 ●Low risk (no factors present) – Estimated median TTP of 110 months; estimated rate of progression of 5 percent per year during the first 10 years.\n【23】 ●Immunoglobulin A (IgA) isotype [13].\n【24】 ●Immunoparesis with reduction of two uninvolved immunoglobulin isotypes [13,16,17].\n【25】 ●Abnormal plasma cell immunophenotype with immunoparesis (reduction of ≥1 uninvolved immunoglobulin isotypes) [17,18]. In contrast, an MGUS-like immunophenotype on flow cytometry may be associated with a lower risk of progression [19].\n【26】 ●Increased circulating plasma cells by immunofluorescence [20] or flow cytometry [21].\n【27】 ●Detection of lesions on MRI of the spine and pelvis [22], evolving pattern of M-spike [23,24].\n【28】 ●Presence of Bence Jones proteinuria in IgG or IgA SMM [25].\n【29】 ●PET/computed tomography (CT) with focal lesion with increased uptake without underlying osteolytic bone destruction [26,27].\n【30】 ●Laboratory studies should include a serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), complete blood count (CBC), serum creatinine, serum calcium, urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) with immunofixation, FLC ratio, and bone marrow biopsy.\n【31】 ●Cross-sectional imaging with either low-dose whole-body CT without contrast or whole-body combined fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT), followed by a whole-body MRI or MRI of the spine and pelvis. Conventional skeletal surveys are no longer a preferred imaging modality. (See  \"Multiple myeloma: Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Choice of modality'.)\n【32】 ●For patients with SMM and no lesions on initial CT (or PET/CT) and MRI, we perform annual MRI to monitor for the development of asymptomatic bone lesions.\n【33】 ●For patients with SMM whose initial imaging demonstrated one focal lesion on MRI, we image every six months, alternating whole-body MRI and whole-body low-dose CT or PET/CT.\n【34】 ●An evolving monoclonal protein level (eMP) defined as an increase in the M protein level of ≥25 percent within the first 12 months (minimum increase ≥0.5 g/dL) and/or a ≥10 percent increase within the first six months of diagnosis in patients with a baseline M protein ≥3 g/dL.\n【35】 ●An evolving change in hemoglobin (eHb) defined as decrease in hemoglobin concentration by ≥0.5 g/dL within 12 months of diagnosis.\n【36】 ●Bone marrow plasma cells ≥20 percent.\n【37】 ●Osteoporosis – Patients with SMM should be evaluated for osteoporosis with a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan and have their vitamin D and calcium intake optimized. If osteoporosis is present, treatment with bisphosphonates may be considered at the same dosing and schedule used for osteoporosis in patients without SMM. Analogs of PTH (eg, teriparatide) and PTH-related protein (eg, abaloparatide) are generally avoided due to their tendency to exacerbate hypercalcemia. (See  \"Multiple myeloma: The use of osteoclast inhibitors\", section on 'Use in smoldering MM, MGUS, or solitary plasmacytoma'.)\n【38】 ●Thromboembolism – There is an increased incidence of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) and arterial thrombosis in patients with plasma cell dyscrasias, including SMM [38-40]. While the mechanisms involving this increased incidence are unclear, a hypercoagulable state secondary to an ongoing clonal plasma cell activity has been suggested [40,41]. Despite this, SMM itself is not an indication for VTE prophylaxis or specific avoidance of medications that increase risk for VTE. (See  \"Multiple myeloma: Prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients receiving immunomodulatory drugs (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide)\".)\n【39】 ●Infections – Patients with plasma cell dyscrasias have an increased risk of developing bacterial and viral infections over that seen in the general population. There are limited data regarding the magnitude of this risk, but it likely falls between that of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS; approximately twofold increased risk [42,43]) and that of symptomatic MM (approximately sevenfold increased risk [44]). For most patients, we follow standard age-based vaccine recommendations that do not differ from the general population. For patients who begin myeloma-directed therapy, we follow an approach similar to that used for patients treated for MM. (See  \"Infections in patients with multiple myeloma\".)\n【40】 ●Second cancers – Persons with MGUS, SMM, and MM also have a higher incidence of developing second cancers [45]. We recommend that patients with SMM be encouraged to participate in age-appropriate cancer screening programs. No additional cancer screening has been recommended for this population. (See  \"Clinical course and management of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance\", section on 'Second malignancies'.)\n【41】 ●Lenalidomide 25 mg on the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle, continued as tolerated for up to two years [35].\n【42】 ●Lenalidomide 25 mg on the first 21 days of each 28-day cycle plus dexamethasone 40 mg weekly [18]. After nine cycles, reduce the lenalidomide dose to 10 mg and discontinue dexamethasone. Continue as tolerated for up to two years.\n【43】 ●Lenalidomide improved PFS in the entire study population (93 versus 76 percent at two years; HR 0.28, 95% CI 0.12-0.62). In the lenalidomide arm, there were fewer progression events due to end-organ damage, including fewer cases of kidney failure (0 versus 3 events) and bone lesions (3 versus 11 events).\n【44】 ●On subgroup analysis, the PFS benefit was clear in patients with high-risk SMM (HR 0.09, 95% CI 0.02-0.44) but did not reach statistical significance in those with intermediate-risk SMM (HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.15-1.85).\n【45】 ●Longer follow-up is needed to evaluate OS. There were two deaths in the lenalidomide arm and four deaths in the observation arm (HR for death 0.46, 95% CI 0.08-2.53).\n【46】 ●Most toxicities were managed with dose modifications. Approximately 20 percent of patients stopped lenalidomide early due to toxicities.\n【47】 ●≥10 percent clonal bone marrow plasma cells plus presence of a monoclonal component (serum IgG ≥3 g/dL, IgA ≥2 g/dL, or Bence-Jones proteinuria >1 g/24 hours); or\n【48】 ●One of the two criteria above plus aberrant plasma cell immunophenotype in >95 percent of clonal plasma cells and immunoparesis (reduction in one or more uninvolved immunoglobulins by more than 25 percent compared with normal)\n【49】 ●Improved PFS (median 9.5 years versus 2.1 years; HR 0.28; 95% CI 0.18-0.44).\n【50】 ●Improved OS (median not reached versus 8.5 years; HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.34-0.95).\n【51】 ●One treatment-related death (a respiratory infection). Severe (grade 3/4) toxicities included infection (6 percent), asthenia (6 percent), neutropenia (5 percent), rash (3 percent), and more second primary malignancies (6 versus 1).\n【52】 ●(See  \"Patient education: Multiple myeloma (The Basics)\".)\n【53】 ●Definition and distinction from other entities – Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is defined as a monoclonal (M) protein ≥3 g/dL and/or 10 to 59 percent bone marrow plasma cells but no end-organ damage (lytic lesions, anemia, renal disease, or hypercalcemia) that can be attributed to the underlying plasma cell disorder or other myeloma-defining events, and no amyloidosis (table 1). Patients with SMM are distinguished from those with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by the size of the M protein and the level of bone marrow involvement, and from multiple myeloma (MM) by the absence of any myeloma-defining event (table 2 and algorithm 1 and table 3). (See  \"Multiple myeloma: Overview of management\", section on 'Verify the diagnosis' and  \"Multiple myeloma: Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Diagnosis'.)\n【54】 ●Natural history – The natural history of patients with SMM is variable. Patients with SMM will progress to symptomatic MM or AL amyloidosis at an approximate rate of 10 percent per year for the first five years, 3 percent per year for the next five years, and 1 to 2 percent per year for the following 10 years. As such, most patients with SMM will progress with a median time to progression of 4.8 years. (See 'Clinical course' above.)\n【55】 ●Risk stratification – We risk stratify individuals with SMM using the Mayo 2018/IMWG risk stratification system (also called the 20/2/20 criteria). Individuals with two or three of the following risk factors are considered to have high-risk SMM (see 'Risk stratification' above):\n【56】 ●Management of low- and intermediate-risk SMM – Observation with deferral of treatment is standard for patients with low-risk SMM (algorithm 2). For patients with intermediate-risk SMM, we suggest observation rather than treatment (Grade 2B). Some patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk SMM can remain stable without treatment over extended periods of time, and it is not clear that treatment with available therapies improves outcomes.

The following findings, if attributable to the underlying plasma cell disorder, are diagnostic of MM (table 1): anemia, hypercalcemia, kidney impairment, lytic bone lesions, and extramedullary plasmacytoma. In addition, the following are diagnostic biomarkers of MM in the absence of symptoms: ≥60 percent clonal plasma cells in the marrow; involved/uninvolved FLC ratio ≥100; or more than one focal bone lesion on MRI.

It is broadly divided in two main types: small plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) and large plaque parapsoriasis (LPP). In both types, lesions are typically asymptomatic or accompanied by mild pruritus and are predominantly located on the trunk. While SPP is generally considered a chronic benign condition, LPP is regarded as a premalignant dermatosis with a substantial risk of progression to mycosis fungoides, the most common type of cutaneous T cell lymphoma. (See  \"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mycosis fungoides\", section on 'Premycotic period'.)\n【2】 SPP and LPP will be discussed in this topic. Other cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders and mycosis fungoides are discussed separately.\n【3】 ●(See  \"Pityriasis lichenoides chronica\".)\n【4】 ●(See  \"Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA)\".)\n【5】 ●(See  \"Lymphomatoid papulosis\".)\n【6】 ●(See  \"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mycosis fungoides\".)\n【7】 EPIDEMIOLOGY — Small plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) and large plaque parapsoriasis (LPP) are rare disorders. Their exact incidence and prevalence are not known. Both SPP and LPP occur most commonly in middle-aged or older individuals; approximately two-thirds of patients are male [3].\n【8】 ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS — The etiology and pathogenesis of small plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) and large plaque parapsoriasis (LPP) are unknown. Both are thought to be cutaneous T cell lymphoproliferative disorders. However, whether they are precursors of mycosis fungoides (MF) or early MF from the outset (the so-called premycotic stage) is still controversial. The superficial dermal infiltrate is composed primarily of CD4+ T cells. Dominant T cell clonality has been demonstrated in many cases of LPP and in a few cases of SPP, although the presence of a dominant T cell clone does not appear to increase the malignant potential of these dermatoses [4-10].\n【9】 The hypothesis of a viral etiology for parapsoriasis has not been confirmed. Evidence of infection with lymphotropic viruses (eg, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and human herpesviruses [HHV] 6 and HHV8) has not been found consistently in patients with parapsoriasis [11-16].\n【10】 SMALL PLAQUE PARAPSORIASIS — Small plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) is a chronic, asymptomatic dermatosis characterized by the presence of small, persistent, scaly patches predominantly located on the trunk. Several terms have been used to describe this condition, including chronic superficial dermatitis, persistent superficial dermatitis, chronic superficial scaly dermatitis, and digitate dermatosis.\n【11】 Clinical manifestations — SPP typically presents with pink or yellowish-brown macules or patches 2 to 5 cm in diameter (picture 1A-B). Macules and patches are often round or oval and variably scaly. The trunk, flanks, and proximal extremities are most commonly involved [2].\n【12】 A distinctive variant of SPP called \"digitate dermatosis\" presents with elongated (digitate, finger-shaped) patches with an atrophic, cigarette-paper-like surface. Lesions are typically located on the flanks, along the skin cleavage lines (picture 2A-B).\n【13】 SPP lesions are most often asymptomatic or mildly pruritic. They may fade or disappear after sun exposure during the summer, but typically recur during the winter months.\n【14】 Histopathology — The histologic features of SPP are nonspecific and resemble those of a mild eczema. The epidermis manifests mild spongiosis (intercellular edema) with focal areas of parakeratosis, scale, and exocytosis of small lymphocytes with normal mature morphology (picture 3). In chronic lesions, the spongiosis is often absent and the epidermis develops a psoriasiform acanthosis [17]. The dermis shows edema, a sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, and dilation of the papillary vessels [17-19].\n【15】 Immunostaining reveals a normal mature T cell phenotype, predominantly CD4+. In some cases, polymerase chain reaction studies demonstrate a dominant clonal pattern of T cells [5,7]. However, it is unclear if this finding is associated with an increased risk of progression to MF.\n【16】 Diagnosis — The diagnosis of SPP is based upon the combination of clinical and histologic findings and clinical course:\n【17】 ●Presence of asymptomatic, erythematous macules <5 cm in diameter mainly located on the trunk (picture 1A), especially if presenting as digitate lesions parallel to skin lines (picture 2A-B)\n【18】 ●Histopathologic finding of nonspecific, superficial dermatitis (see 'Histopathology' above)\n【19】 ●Persistence of the lesions over time and history of resistance to treatment\n【20】 Multiple skin biopsies may be required if lesions of diverse morphology (eg, erythematous, atrophic, poikilodermatous) are present. Repeated biopsies over time also may be needed in difficult cases.\n【21】 Differential diagnosis — The differential diagnosis of SPP includes:\n【22】 ●Mycosis fungoides – The main differential diagnosis of SPP is with early mycosis fungoides (MF). In MF, lesions are usually larger (>5 cm in diameter) and less uniform in size, color, and shape than SPP lesions. Histology of early MF shows haloed atypical lymphocytes within the epidermis (epidermotropism), sometimes forming intraepidermal aggregates (Pautrier microabscesses), single lymphocytes arranged linearly along the dermoepidermal junction, vacuolar interface dermatitis, and dermal fibrosis [9]. (See  \"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mycosis fungoides\".)\n【23】 ●Pityriasis lichenoides chronica – Pityriasis lichenoides chronica typically presents with recurrent crops of erythematous scaly papules that spontaneously regress over several weeks to months (picture 4). Histology shows a band-like lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. There is exocytosis, extravasation of erythrocytes, and focal parakeratosis. (See  \"Pityriasis lichenoides chronica\".)\n【24】 ●Guttate psoriasis – Guttate psoriasis presents with small, erythematous plaques with fine scale (picture 5A-B). Histology of early lesions demonstrates mild acanthosis, papillary dermal edema, capillary dilatation, and a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate. Older lesions show hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis, acanthosis, and collections of neutrophils in the epidermis (Munro microabscesses). (See  \"Guttate psoriasis\".)\n【25】 ●Pityriasis rosea – Pityriasis rosea typically presents in children and young adults with round or oval, sharply delimited, pink or salmon-colored lesions on the chest, neck, or back (picture 6A-D). The presence of a herald patch (picture 7A-B)and resolution within a few weeks to months differentiates pityriasis rosea from SPP. (See  \"Pityriasis rosea\".)\n【26】 ●Nummular dermatitis – Nummular dermatitis is characterized by intensely pruritic, coin-shaped lesions of eczematous dermatitis, with crusting and serous oozing on close inspection (picture 8A-B). (See  \"Overview of dermatitis (eczematous dermatoses)\", section on 'Nummular eczema'.)\n【27】 Management — Patients with SPP are usually asymptomatic and require minimal or no treatment. Scaling and mild pruritus may be controlled with emollients [20]. However, treatment is required for patients whose pruritus is not controlled with emollients or who have cosmetic concerns.\n【28】 Initial therapy — For patients with SPP who require treatment, we suggest topical corticosteroids rather than simple emollients. We generally use moderate to high-potency corticosteroids (group two to four (table 1)) once or twice a day for 8 to 12 weeks. Emollients can be used liberally in conjunction with topical corticosteroids. The clearance of all skin lesions indicates a good response to treatment. Recurrence is common and may occur weeks to months after stopping the treatment. Recurrent lesions can be treated with another course of topical corticosteroids.\n【29】 The use of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of SPP has not been evaluated in randomized trials. Their use is based upon clinical experience and indirect evidence of efficacy in inducing lesion regression in early MF [21,22]. (See  \"Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides\", section on 'Topical corticosteroids'.)\n【30】 The long-term use of topical corticosteroids, particularly those belonging to the high- and super high-potency groups, may result in skin atrophy, telangiectasia, and striae. In addition, if applied to large skin surfaces, topical corticosteroids may result in systemic absorption and adrenal suppression. (See  \"Topical corticosteroids: Use and adverse effects\", section on 'Adverse effects'.)\n【31】 Poor response to initial therapy — For patients with unsatisfactory response to topical corticosteroids (eg, clearance of less than 50 percent of lesions), we suggest phototherapy with broadband or narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) or, less frequently, psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA). Phototherapy is generally administered two to three times per week for several months until clearance of lesions is achieved. The frequency of treatments is gradually tapered to once per week or less and then discontinued. (See  \"UVB phototherapy (broadband and narrowband)\".)\n【32】 There is limited evidence of efficacy of phototherapy in the treatment of SPP from small case series or single case reports [23-28]. The optimal length of treatment and the tapering schedule have not been determined. In one study including 14 patients with SPP, treatment duration of less than four months was associated with relapse in all patients after an average time of six months [26].\n【33】 Monitoring — Given the chronic, benign course of SPP, patients with SPP can be monitored with yearly total body skin examination. Changing or progressing lesions should be biopsied because there are scattered reports of patients with an initial diagnosis of SPP who subsequently developed overt MF [3,5].\n【34】 Prognosis — SPP may persist for years or decades and then resolves spontaneously. Most experts consider SPP to be a benign disorder without malignant potential. However, there are rare reports of patients with an initial diagnosis of SPP who subsequently developed MF [3,5].\n【35】 LARGE PLAQUE PARAPSORIASIS — Large plaque parapsoriasis (LPP) is a chronic dermatosis characterized by the presence of fixed, large, atrophic, erythematous patches, usually located on the trunk. Other terms that have been used to describe LPP include poikiloderma vasculare atrophicans and parakeratosis variegata.\n【36】 Clinical manifestations — LPP presents with large (>5 cm in diameter), irregularly shaped, erythematous, dusky red or brown patches with fine scaling (picture 9A-D). Lesions frequently show epidermal atrophy (\"cigarette paper\" wrinkling) or poikiloderma (ie, the combination of mottled pigmentation, telangiectasia, and epidermal atrophy) (picture 10A-B). LPP typically involves areas not exposed to the sun (eg, buttocks, thighs, lower trunk, flexural surfaces, as well as breasts and inframammary areas).\n【37】 Histopathology — The histopathology of LPP reveals (picture 11) [17]:\n【38】 ●Variable psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia (or atrophy in poikilodermatous areas [ie, areas with a combination of mottled pigmentation, telangiectasia, and epidermal atrophy])\n【39】 ●Vacuolization in the basal keratinocyte layer\n【40】 ●Capillary dilation\n【41】 ●Brisk lymphocytic infiltrate with a band-like distribution that can obscure the dermoepidermal junction\n【42】 The infiltrate is composed of small lymphocytes, some of which may have cerebriform, convoluted nuclei. There is focal lymphocytic epidermotropism, but Pautrier microabscesses (ie, clusters of atypical lymphocytes in the epidermis), a classic histologic characteristic of mycosis fungoides (MF), are usually absent in LPP [17,18].\n【43】 Immunophenotyping demonstrates normal CD4/CD8 ratio and maintenance of the pan-T cell antigen CD7, a marker of mature T cells [29]. However, some studies have demonstrated that benign T cell infiltrates, including parapsoriasis, may lose CD7 expression [30,31]. Both small plaque parapsoriasis (SPP) and LPP have increased expression of the dendritic/Langerhans cell marker CD1a [32,33].\n【44】 Most cases of LPP appear to express the thymocyte selection-associated high-mobility group box protein gene (TOX), a potential marker of MF [34]. However, whether TOX expression is a predictor of progression of LPP to MF or a marker to discriminate those LPP cases that are MF from the outset has not been determined. Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1) has also been found to have upregulated expression in MF as compared with parapsoriasis and may be helpful for identifying a transformation into malignancy [35].\n【45】 Clonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements have been identified by polymerase chain reaction analysis in up to 50 percent of LPP cases [4,8]. However, the presence of a predominant T cell clone is not diagnostic of LPP nor is an indication of increased risk of progression to MF.\n【46】 Diagnosis — A careful clinicopathologic correlation is required for the diagnosis of LPP. Multiple skin biopsies may be required if lesions of diverse morphology (eg, erythematous, atrophic, poikilodermatous) are present. (See 'Clinical manifestations' above.)\n【47】 A diagnosis of LPP is usually made in a patient presenting with multiple, asymptomatic erythematous, scaly, and slightly atrophic patches, mainly located on the trunk (picture 9A-D), showing on histopathologic examination features that are suspicious for MF (eg, dense band-like lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction, focal epidermotropism) but do not fulfill the morphologic criteria for early MF [9,36]. The diagnosis may be especially difficult in those cases of LPP that show immunophenotypic and molecular features similar to early MF. (See 'Histopathology' above and  \"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mycosis fungoides\", section on 'Morphology'.)\n【48】 Repeated biopsies over time are needed to monitor for possible progression to MF. (See 'Differential diagnosis' below.)\n【49】 Differential diagnosis — The differential diagnosis of LPP includes:\n【50】 ●Mycosis fungoides – The clinical differentiation of early (patch stage) MF and LPP may be difficult or impossible in some cases. Clinical monitoring and repeated skin biopsies often are required for definitive diagnosis. The primary patches of LPP are more likely to fade in the summer than the more persistent patches of early MF.\n【51】 Histologically, MF is characterized by a papillary dermal infiltrate of small- to medium-sized atypical mononuclear cells with cerebriform nuclei, single-cell epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes, or atypical lymphocytes forming intraepidermal aggregates (Pautrier microabscesses) (picture 12). Spongiosis (intercellular edema in the epidermis) is not a feature of MF.\n【52】 However, some of these findings may be missing in early MF. Although there are no universally accepted minimal criteria for the diagnosis of MF, the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphoma and the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer has devised an algorithm for the diagnosis of early MF based upon the integration of clinical, histopathologic, molecular, and immunophenotypic criteria (table 2) [9]. Cases that fail to meet any specific set of criteria for the diagnosis of early MF may be diagnosed as LPP. (See  \"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mycosis fungoides\", section on 'Diagnostic algorithm'.)\n【53】 ●Contact dermatitis – Subacute or chronic allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) may be difficult to differentiate from LPP (picture 13). On histology, both diseases show minimal or absent spongiosis and lymphocytic exocytosis. However, history of allergen exposure, positive patch test results to suspected allergens, and response to treatment and avoidance measures support the diagnosis of ACD. (See  \"Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis\".)\n【54】 ●Plaque psoriasis – In contrast with the flat lesions of LPP, the psoriasis plaques are erythematous with sharply defined margins raised above the surrounding normal skin (picture 14A-C). There is frequent involvement of elbows and knees, and nail pitting may be seen at close inspection (picture 15). Histology shows prominent epidermal hyperplasia, parakeratosis, neutrophilic exocytosis, and dilated vessels in dermal papillae, which are typically less prominent or absent in LPP. (See  \"Psoriasis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Chronic plaque psoriasis'.)\n【55】 Management — Patients with LPP require treatment to control pruritus if present and suppress the skin lesions. They also require close clinical monitoring because of the substantial risk of developing MF.\n【56】 Patients for whom a clear-cut distinction between LPP and early MF cannot be made either clinically or histologically may be treated with skin-directed therapies as indicated for stage IA MF. (See  \"Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides\", section on 'Our approach'.)\n【57】 Initial therapy — We suggest topical corticosteroids as initial treatment for patients with LPP. We typically use high- to super high-potency topical corticosteroids (groups one and two (table 1)) twice daily for 12 weeks and continue once daily or taper off if improvement is noted. Emollients can be used liberally in conjunction with topical corticosteroids.\n【58】 The clearance of all or most skin lesions indicates a good response to treatment. If no response is observed after 12 weeks of treatment, topical corticosteroids should be stopped. Patients who do not respond to topical corticosteroids may be treated with phototherapy.\n【59】 In patients who respond to topical corticosteroids, recurrence is common and may occur weeks to months after stopping the treatment. Recurrent lesions can be treated with another course of topical corticosteroids.\n【60】 The use of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of LPP has not been evaluated in randomized trials. Indirect evidence of efficacy in inducing lesion regression is derived from observational studies of patients with patch stage MF [21,22]. (See  \"Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides\", section on 'Topical corticosteroids'.)\n【61】 Extensive or recalcitrant disease — We suggest phototherapy with broadband or narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) or, less frequently, psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) for the treatment of LPP in the following situations:\n【62】 ●Patients with LPP who have extensive skin involvement, marked skin atrophy, or poikiloderma\n【63】 ●Patients who fail to respond to topical corticosteroids (ie, clearance of less than 50 percent of lesions)\n【64】 ●Patients who have disease progression\n【65】 Phototherapy is generally administered two to three times per week for several months, until clearance of lesions is achieved. The frequency of treatments is gradually tapered to once per week or less and then discontinued. The benefits of a long-term maintenance treatment have not been evaluated. Recurrences may be treated by resuming the initial phototherapy schedule. (See  \"UVB phototherapy (broadband and narrowband)\" and  \"Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) photochemotherapy\".)\n【66】 There are no randomized trials or large observational studies of phototherapy for the treatment of LPP. Its use is based upon limited evidence of efficacy from small case series and indirect evidence of efficacy in early MF [37-39]. (See  \"Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides\", section on 'Phototherapy'.)\n【67】 The short-term and long-term adverse effects of phototherapy are discussed in detail separately. (See  \"UVB phototherapy (broadband and narrowband)\", section on 'Short- and long-term adverse effects' and  \"Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) photochemotherapy\", section on 'Adverse effects'.)\n【68】 The use of topical nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine) or topical carmustine has been described in patients with LPP, particularly those in whom LPP cannot clearly be distinguished from MF [40,41]. These agents and their adverse effects are discussed separately. (See  \"Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides\", section on 'Topical mechlorethamine' and  \"Treatment of early stage (IA to IIA) mycosis fungoides\", section on 'Topical carmustine'.)\n【69】 Monitoring — Patients with LPP require a close clinical monitoring because of the substantial risk of evolution to MF [3,42]. A total body skin examination ideally should be performed every six months. Patients should be counseled about the risk of developing MF and advised to seek medical attention if thicker plaques or nodules develop. There are no guidelines suggesting how often patients with LPP should be rebiopsied to detect a possible progression to MF. However, significant clinical change (eg, thicker plaques, increased atrophy, nodules, ulceration, an \"ugly duckling\" lesion) is an indication for biopsy. Additionally, presence of a cutaneous T cell clone in LPP may increase the risk of progression to MF [10].\n【70】 Prognosis — LPP may persist for years or decades. In retrospective observational studies, approximately 10 to 30 percent of cases of LPP evolved to overt MF [2,3,42-44]. Patients with LPP may also have an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphomas other than MF and nonhematologic cancers [43].

{"seq_id": 11605, "text": "url: https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/rehabilitative-and-integrative-therapies-for-pain-in-patients-with-cancer?search=%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%96%E9%83%A8%E8%A3%85%E7%BD%AE%E7%9A%84%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85%E3%80%81%E8%B0%83%E6%95%B4%E6%88%96%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86&source=search_result&selectedTitle=19%7E150&usage_type=default\n【0】 癌症疼痛的康复和整合治疗\n【1】 Although opioid-based pharmacotherapy is widely accepted as the mainstay of treatment for moderate to severe pain in patients with active cancer, other treatment approaches should be considered in every case. A multimodality approach that includes nonpharmacologic therapies in conjunction with opioids has the potential to augment pain relief, reduce opioid side effects through lower opioid doses, and yield better physical and psychosocial outcomes. There are numerous nonpharmacologic therapies, including primary treatments for the etiology of the pain (eg, radiotherapy), and both invasive (eg, nerve blocks) and noninvasive symptomatic therapies.\n【2】 This topic review discusses a diverse group of noninvasive, nonpharmacologic therapies that are widely used as adjuncts to opioid therapy for patients with cancer pain. Included are the so called integrative (complementary) approaches and rehabilitative therapies that employ physical medicine techniques for analgesic purposes. Classification approaches for integrative therapies vary and this review encompasses well accepted psychologic approaches that are sometimes included among the integrative therapies, specifically mind-body approaches (eg, relaxation training, meditation, guided imagery and clinical hypnosis). Cognitive behavioral therapy is considered a mainstream, conventional psychologic approach. However, because it often incorporates mind-body practices (eg mindfulness) it can be described as an integrative therapy [1,2].\n【3】 Assessment of cancer pain, a review of specific cancer pain syndromes, general principles of cancer pain management, the clinical use of opioid analgesics, non-opioid analgesics (including adjuvant analgesics), invasive symptomatic therapies for cancer pain management, and an overview of complementary and integrative therapies in oncology care are covered separately:\n【4】 ●(See  \"Assessment of cancer pain\".)\n【5】 ●(See  \"Overview of cancer pain syndromes\".)\n【6】 ●(See  \"Cancer pain management: General principles and risk management for patients receiving opioids\".)\n【7】 ●(See  \"Cancer pain management with opioids: Optimizing analgesia\".)\n【8】 ●(See  \"Cancer pain management: Role of adjuvant analgesics (coanalgesics)\".)\n【9】 ●(See  \"Cancer pain management: Interventional therapies\".)\n【10】 ●(See  \"Radiation therapy for the management of painful bone metastases\".)\n【11】 ●(See  \"Overview of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine practices in oncology care, and potential risks and harm\".)\n【12】 Other approaches that use electricity or magnetic waves are invasive (eg, dorsal column stimulation) or yet rarely considered for cancer patients (eg, transcranial neuromodulation) and are not discussed in this topic. Some of these techniques and other invasive interventional therapies for cancer pain are discussed elsewhere. (See  \"Cancer pain management: Interventional therapies\".)\n【13】 Therapeutic exercise (physical therapy) can be a time-limited intervention that may ameliorate pain and other musculoskeletal symptoms. Therapeutic exercise involves the systematic implementation of planned physical movements, postures, or activities designed to ameliorate impairment, improve function, and enhance overall wellbeing. Manual stretching, myofascial therapy, passive mobilization, and active exercises are some of the modalities utilized within this approach. The type, frequency, and duration of exercise is always informed by the specific needs and medical condition of the patient and the overall goals of care. Self-exercises using an inflatable ball and Pilates (a low-impact exercise program that focuses on improving flexibility, stability, core strength and range of motion) may be considered in tandem with therapeutic exercise as approaches that may address pain and function impairment in cancer patients.\n【14】 Particularly in patients who have musculoskeletal pathology contributing to pain or dysfunction, physical therapy may address this pathology and yield positive effects. Indirect positive effects resulting from general conditioning or other physiologic or psychologic changes also may occur [3].\n【15】 There are very few data from high-quality controlled studies that assess the impact of therapeutic exercise on pain [4]. Nonetheless, studies in cancer populations, including populations with advanced cancer [5], suggest benefits for exercise in terms of symptom control and other aspects of quality of life:\n【16】 ●A systematic review of 18 randomized studies demonstrated the effectiveness of physical therapy for improving postoperative pain and range of motion after breast cancer treatment [6].\n【17】 ●A multicenter trial that randomized 355 patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) to usual care or usual care plus Exercise for Cancer Patients (EXCAP; a six-week, individualized, moderate-intensity program of progressive walking and resistance training) found that EXCAP was effective in reducing numbness and tingling and hot/coldness in hands and feet [7]. Another randomized trial of a 10-week, home-based exercise program (incorporating muscle strengthening and balancing exercise) in 45 patients with CIPN showed that this program yielded significant positive change in neuropathic pain scores and quality of life [8]. The benefits of exercise in patients with chemotherapy-induced chronic neuropathy are addressed in more detail elsewhere. (See  \"Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy\", section on 'Exercise'.)\n【18】 ●Another randomized trial of 121 breast cancer survivors with aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia found that 150 minutes of aerobic exercise a week and supervised strength training sessions twice a week yielded a significant reduction of joint pain, pain severity, and interference group [9]. A similar benefit was shown in the randomized HOPE trial [10]. (See  \"Adjuvant endocrine and targeted therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer\", section on 'Musculoskeletal pains and stiffness'.)\n【19】 ●A retrospective study of 102 adult cancer patients found that an individualized exercise program resulted in a significant improvement in cardiopulmonary function and both fatigue and pain [11]. (See  \"Cancer-related fatigue: Treatment\", section on 'Exercise'.)\n【20】 ●A quasi-experimental study of inflatable ball exercise in breast cancer survivors found that the intervention significantly improved flexion and extension of shoulder range of motion compared with conventional exercise (n = 38 in inflatable exercise group and n = 34 in conventional exercise group). The authors concluded that inflatable ball exercise could be appropriate to start a physical rehabilitation program and should be followed by conventional exercise after the pain and range of motion have improved [12].\n【21】 ●A systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized studies and two uncontrolled trials evaluating Pilates concluded that this approach was superior to other therapeutic exercise programs in improving pain and self-reported upper extremity function in patients with breast cancer [13].\n【22】 Hydrotherapy has been used in many disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and fibromyalgia [14-16]. (See  \"Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults not responsive to initial therapies\", section on 'Exercise and physical therapy' and  \"Treatment of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults\", section on 'Nonpharmacologic interventions' and  \"Nonpharmacologic therapies for patients with rheumatoid arthritis\", section on 'Physical therapy'.)\n【23】 Hydrotherapy has also been used in the management of pain and other symptoms in populations with cancer. A 2022 systematic review of studies reporting the use, effectiveness, and potential harms associated with water therapy for cancer-related symptoms identified 12 studies describing 430 patients [17]; outcomes were heterogeneous and definitive conclusions were not possible, but the data suggested that the approaches are generally safe and can benefit some patients. For example, a single-blind randomized trial of 40 breast cancer survivors with aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia found that aquatic exercise in a chest-high pool (three sessions/week for a total of 24 sessions over two months) decreased the pressure pain threshold in neck, hand, shoulder, and leg, with no worsening of pain, compared with controls [18]. (See  \"Managing the side effects of tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors\", section on 'Musculoskeletal pains and stiffness'.)\n【24】 As with other therapeutic exercise approaches, hydrotherapy and aquatic exercise should always be preceded by a consultation between the physiatrist and the oncologist and careful evaluation of the patient.\n【25】 ●Immobilizers of the shoulder and arm for a painful brachial plexopathy.\n【26】 ●Corsets for persistent pain after treatment for vertebral metastases.\n【27】 ●Wrist or ankle splints for distal extremity weakness or pain related to neuropathy.\n【28】 Patients with pain on movement may benefit from a splint that is designed to limit those motions that incite the pain. In the cancer population, and particularly in the setting of advanced illness, the use of an orthosis may be preferable to other interventions, such as physical therapy, that attempt to improve function. A return to full function may not be possible, or it may not be the primary treatment goal. Evaluation by an occupational therapist, with input by the oncologist, can clarify the availability and cost of various options.\n【29】 Stump pain may be ameliorated by a well-fitting prosthesis, an ambulation aid may reduce pain exacerbation with walking, and devices designed to facilitate specific functions such as toileting or eating can have analgesic consequences or reduce the risk of secondary painful complications related to immobility.\n【30】 Physical modalities may be especially useful as adjuncts for mild to moderate pain and while awaiting the effect of a breakthrough analgesic. They are never adequate alone for managing moderate or severe cancer pain. There are no comparative data to guide suggestions concerning the selection of specific modalities when used as adjunctive treatment for pain, and the choice of technique is empirical. Based on inference and concern about adverse cutaneous effects, guidelines often suggest avoiding the topical application of these stimuli to areas with reduced sensation and those that are directly superficial to tumor masses.\n【31】 Nevertheless, clinical experience suggests that some patients with cancer-related pain benefit from TENS, and TENS is included in the list of potential nonpharmacologic interventions for adult cancer pain in guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network [29].\n【32】 TENS can be tried during a home trial or as a supervised trial when working with a physical therapist. Given the lack of certainly about the stimulation parameters most likely to help in an individual patient, a serious trial of TENS requires many days and should explore various sites and timing of stimulation, as well as a variety of stimulation parameters (amplitude, frequency, and pattern).\n【33】 ●A prospective survey of 219 patients treated with Scrambler therapy for different types of chronic pain (37.9 percent with cancer pain) documented pain reduction for at least two weeks [35].\n【34】 ●On the other hand, two randomized, sham-controlled pilot trials of scrambler therapy for CIPN yielded conflicting results, one positive [33] and one negative [34].\n【35】 The available data support the conclusion that Scrambler therapy is safe [36], and notwithstanding the need for larger randomized studies, the available data suggest that Scrambler therapy may be a useful alternative for some patients [37,38]. A neuropathic component to the pain may increase the likelihood of benefit. The use of Scrambler therapy for treatment of patients with CIPN is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See  \"Prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy\", section on 'Scrambler therapy'.)\n【36】 Numerous clinical guidelines have been developed to guide the treatment of lymphedema; several focus on the cancer population [39]. Most of these guidelines, whether cancer-related or not, recommend an integrated approach that considers both physical and psychologic interventions. Rigorous treatment protocols may start with education focused on skin care and avoidance of trauma, and depending on the cause and other factors, may recommend manual lymph drainage, intermittent pneumatic compression, compression bandaging, complete decongestive physiotherapy, taping, or exercises (including aquatic exercises). If the girth in the affected limb can be reduced, patients usually experience a decline in uncomfortable heaviness or stretch, and in secondary myofascial pains [40]. (See  \"Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema\" and  \"Breast cancer-associated lymphedema\", section on 'Effectiveness of conservative treatments' and  \"Lower extremity lymphedema\", section on 'Conservative care'.)\n【37】 Exercise may also be beneficial, particularly for breast cancer-related lymphedema. Specific recommendations are provided in more detail elsewhere. (See  \"Breast cancer-associated lymphedema\".)\n【38】 Some of the approaches for extremity lymphedema also may benefit lymphedema in other sites, such as in the head and neck region. As an example, a retrospective study of 32 patients with head and neck cancer who received physical therapy (lymphatic drainage; massage; compression therapy; facial, tongue, and neck exercises) and patient education for lymphedema showed significant improvement in face and neck lymphedema and pain after an average of 23.9 sessions [41]. (See  \"Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment\", section on 'Lymphedema and fibrosis'.)\n【39】 Some classifications distinguish complementary therapies into the following broad categories:\n【40】 ●Traditional and whole medical systems, such as traditional East Asian medicine, Ayurveda, homeopathy, naturopathy, and chiropractic care.\n【41】 ●Mind and body practices, such as meditation, mindfulness-based interventions (eg, Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction [MBSR]), meditation, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), clinical hypnosis, creative arts therapy, yoga, and manipulative body-based practices such as massage, reflexology, and acupuncture/acupressure.\n【42】 ●Biologic-based therapies, such as herbal therapies (dietary supplements and botanicals), specialized diets.\n【43】 ●Energy therapies, such a therapeutic touch, healing touch, and reiki.\n【44】 Like traditional allopathic medical approaches, all integrative therapies are associated with risks, which must be evaluated for the individual patient and balanced with the potential for benefits. Some treatments have inherently high risks (eg, spinal manipulation in the setting of symptomatic bone metastases or the use of herbal remedies that directly interact with other anticancer therapies, such as chemotherapy) and clinicians should strongly recommend against these. Many others, however, carry very low levels of risk and may be supported by clinicians despite limited evidence of benefit. If practitioners are available and the cost is affordable, there is no reason to discourage patients from integrating these latter types of treatments with other conventional therapies, at least for a therapeutic trial. (See  \"Overview of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine practices in oncology care, and potential risks and harm\", section on 'Potential risks and harms of caim use'.)\n【45】 ●Studies that have evaluated clinician-patient communications about the use of integrative therapies have highlighted concerns about disclosure and the need for improvements [42]. A trusting relationship with a treating clinician will encourage patients not only to disclose their interest in complementary therapies, but also to be forthcoming in discussing therapies they are already following. This will allow the clinician to discuss any contraindications and risks with the patient and to make treatment recommendations. (See  \"Overview of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine practices in oncology care, and potential risks and harm\", section on 'Discussing CAIM with patients'.)\n【46】 Many of these treatments require a competent and specifically trained health professional, but some, such as relaxation training based on slow and mindful breathing, may be taught by a knowledgeable primary care provider. (See  \"Overview of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine practices in oncology care, and potential risks and harm\".)\n【47】 The benefits of some mainstream MBPs (meditation, hypnosis, relaxation, guided imagery, therapeutic suggestion, and CBT) have been addressed in the following systematic reviews:\n【48】 ●In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 60 randomized trials (6404 participants) that evaluated the use of MBPs for symptom management in adults also prescribed opioids for clinical pain (acute or chronic); only five of the trials focused on patients with cancer pain [44]. The trials evaluated meditation/mindfulness (n = 5), hypnosis (n = 25), relaxation (n = 14), guided imagery (n = 7), therapeutic suggestion (n = 6), and CBT (n = 7) interventions. The primary outcome was pain intensity, which was standardized using a 0 to 10-point numeric rating scale.\n【49】 Taken together, MBPs had a significant, albeit moderate, association with reduced pain (29 studies, 2916 patients, mean difference -0.51, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.27, with some heterogeneity of effect size). Whether this change represents a clinically meaningful result is unclear. Benefits for cancer pain were not reported separately. The analysis also addressed the benefits of MBPs in terms of opioid dose. MBPs also had a significant but small association with reduced opioid use (eight studies, 435 patients, mean difference -0.26, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.08, with homogeneous effect sizes).\n【50】 ●In a meta-analysis of 37 randomized trials of psychotherapy, CBT, and some other MBPs (relaxation, hypnosis, desensitization with imagery or biofeedback, meditation) in 4199 cancer patients in whom pain intensity and interference were measured as outcomes, the mean effect size for reduction in pain intensity, the primary outcome, was 0.34 (95% CI 0.23-0.46), and for pain interference, it was 0.40 (95% CI 0.21-0.60) [45]. These differences between intervention and control were defined as medium effect sizes.\n【51】 ●In a systematic review of 10 randomized controlled trials published between 28 January, 2015 and December 15, 2020 evaluating various MBPs for cancer pain, the most effective therapies were mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, guided imagery, progressive muscle relaxation, and emotional and symptom focused engagement [46]. Music therapy and brief cognitive behavioral strategies require more research, while coping skills training and yoga did not show positive effects. Effect sizes were moderate and tended to increase at follow-up.\n【52】 ●Another systematic review and meta-analysis of 40 randomized controlled studies involving a total of 3569 participants showed a significant effect of MBPS on intensity of cancer pain (mean difference -0.39, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.16) but with considerable heterogeneity [47]. Excluding four \"outlier\" studies in sensitivity analyses resulted in an effect size that remained significant but was weaker. There was a high risk of bias in all studies and many were of low quality.\n【53】 Acupuncture, acupressure, and reflexology may be effective integrative therapies for a variety of cancer pain conditions. In 2008, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declared in a consensus statement that acupuncture is not an experimental therapy but a sound medical technique comparable in effectiveness to common conventional medical treatments for certain clinical conditions, such as nausea and pain [49]. Despite this statement, the effectiveness of acupuncture for patients with cancer pain has been difficult to prove. Although some studies have suggested that acupuncture and electroacupuncture can be useful in ameliorating cancer-related and cancer treatment-related neuropathic pain, there are few well-conducted, rigorous trials that include a sham acupuncture control group, which is necessary because of the strong placebo effect of both acupuncture and sham acupuncture. (See  \"Overview of the clinical uses of acupuncture\", section on 'Research challenges'.)\n【54】 The clinical uses and evidence base to support benefit for acupuncture, acupressure, and reflexology are outlined in the following sections.\n【55】 At least seven trials have explored the benefit of foot reflexology for general or musculoskeletal pain during cancer therapy (cytotoxic therapy, chemoradiotherapy, molecularly targeted and/or hormonal therapy) [50-56]. They were mostly small (four trials had fewer than 50 patients per arm), all used different methods to implement the reflexology intervention, and the type of control varied between trials (attention control, in which the individuals receive the same dose of interpersonal interaction as intervention participants but no other elements of the intervention to control for the benefits of attention that may come from behavioral interventions, usual or standard care, or other active treatment such as relaxation). Nevertheless, six of the seven noted significantly less pain in the intervention group compared with controls.\n【56】 A 2022 joint American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/Society for Integrative Oncology (SIO) guideline endorsed the use of reflexology for pain during systemic therapy for cancer (benefits outweigh harms, evidence quality intermediate, strength of recommendation moderate) [57]. (See 'Clinical practice guidelines' below.)\n【57】 Multiple meta-analyses have addressed the benefits of acupuncture and acupressure for a variety of types of cancer-related pain, including general or musculoskeletal pain unrelated to aromatase inhibitor use, and postsurgical pain:\n【58】 ●A 2015 Cochrane review of five randomized trials (only one of which included a sham acupuncture control group [58]; the others compared acupuncture to placebo or systemically administered analgesics) totaling 285 patients with cancer pain concluded that there was insufficient evidence to judge whether acupuncture was effective in treating cancer pain from a variety of etiologies in adults [59].\n【59】 ●A similar conclusion was reached in a later Cochrane review of acupuncture for chronic peripheral neuropathic pain in adults, including cancer-related neuropathy [60].\n【60】 ●On the other hand, a benefit for acupuncture and acupressure in reducing pain in patients with cancer was supported by a more rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials (with 1111 patients) [61], including seven sham-controlled randomized trials [62-68]. The primary outcome was pain intensity, as measured by a score of 1 to 10 on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Numeric Rating Scale, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), or Verbal Rating Scale. Thirteen studies focused on a specific type of cancer pain (six on aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgias, two on lung cancer pain, one on gastric cancer pain, one on pancreatic cancer pain, one on malignant neuropathic pain, one on bone metastatic pain, and one on persistent pain after a surgical procedure), while four investigated general cancer pain with a mix of diagnoses.\n【61】 An analysis of the seven sham-controlled trials, which were judged to be of high quality and at a low risk of bias, showed that real (as compared with sham) acupuncture was associated with reduced pain intensity (mean difference -1.38 points, 95% CI -2.13 to -0.64). In the non-sham-controlled studies, a favorable association was also noted when acupuncture and acupressure were combined with analgesic therapy versus analgesic therapy alone (six trials, mean difference in pain intensity -1.44 points, 95% CI -1.98 to -0.89) and in two trials of acupressure or acupuncture plus analgesic therapy versus analgesic therapy alone for reduced opioid dose (mean difference -30 mg, 95% CI -37.5 to -22.5). The certainty of evidence was judged to be moderate because of the substantial heterogeneity among studies.\n【62】 ●A later randomized trial of electroacupuncture or auricular acupuncture versus usual care for chronic musculoskeletal cancer pain included 360 cancer survivors; the group receiving usual care received standard pain management including analgesic medications, physical therapy, and glucocorticoid injections; they were offered the option of receiving 10 acupuncture treatments after week 12 (the duration of the primary end point) [69]. Compared with usual care, electroacupuncture reduced pain severity by 1.9 points on a scale of 0 to 10 (97.5% CI 1.4-2.4 points), and auricular acupuncture reduced pain severity by 1.6 points (97.5% CI 1.0-2.1) from baseline to week 12. Adverse events were mild; only 10 percent of those receiving auricular acupuncture and 1 percent of those receiving electroacupuncture discontinued treatment for adverse effects.\n【63】 At least 12 randomized trials assessing the impact of acupuncture or acupressure in reducing pain associated with surgery or other procedures in cancer patients, all of which are limited by small size, and either uncertain or high risk of bias [70-81]. Of the nine trials addressing postoperative pain, six showed no significant difference between the acupuncture and control groups, while three demonstrated a lower pain score compared with usual postoperative care [74-76]. Two trials on bone marrow aspiration and biopsy pain concluded that acupressure significantly reduced procedure-related pain compared with a sham control group [70,71], and one trial showed that acupuncture significantly reduced pain, nausea, and anxiety in the first two postoperative days compared with usual care [72].\n【64】 Two published guidelines on the role of integrative therapy in patients with cancer concluded that acupuncture can be offered to patients with pain after cancer surgery, but the certainty of the evidence was low [57,82]. (See 'Clinical practice guidelines' below.)\n【65】 Cancer pain is significantly affected by psychologic factors and an individual's cognitive style. According to the cognitive-behavioral model, an individual's interpretation of external events and bodily sensations directly affects his or her emotional reactions to these events and subsequent behavior. The three main components of CBT are: cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, and problem solving. Cognitive restructuring involves identifying and modifying unhelpful thinking patterns that are believed to increase distress [83-85]. Dichotomous thinking, catastrophizing, and overgeneralization, among others, are considered dysfunctional cognitive patterns because they typically arise from limited information and do not accurately reflect reality (table 1).\n【66】 CBT approaches to management of cancer pain can effectively improve coping, self-efficacy, and a sense of control over the pain [86]. Many of these interventions were initially developed for patients with chronic, noncancer pain and subsequently applied to the treatment of patients with cancer. (See  \"Approach to the management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults\", section on 'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'.)\n【67】 While numerous studies have investigated the role of CBT in the treatment of mood disturbances in patients with cancer, few have considered cancer-related pain as the outcome variable:\n【68】 ●At least three well-designed randomized controlled trials [87-89] demonstrated that behavioral skill training could reduce cancer-related pain during a short follow-up period of six months. On the other hand, two other trials of CBT to reduce treatment-related pain (mainly from mucositis) in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation failed to show a benefit [90,91].\n【69】 ●A meta-analysis of randomized trials examining CBT for distress and pain in breast cancer patients, which included two randomized trials in which pain was an outcome measure [92,93], concluded that patients who were administered CBT had significantly less distress and pain compared with those in control groups [94].\n【70】 ●A systematic review and meta-analysis examined 95 clinical trials evaluating the impact of CBT and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy approaches on functional health variables, including pain, in cancer survivors [95,96]. Subgroup analyses of common outcomes within the functional health domain revealed a small but statistically significant treatment effect for pain (0.209, 95% CI 0.051-0.367). Overall, CBT had a significant positive treatment effect on functional health outcomes in patients receiving active cancer treatment and during the survivorship phase but not in those with newly diagnosed cancers. The authors postulated that newly diagnosed patients may feel overwhelmed by the news and may not respond well, at least initially, to a structured approach such as CBT. However, as patients adjust to the diagnosis and focus on identifying strategies to improve coping, CBT has a significant positive impact across cancer diagnoses.\n【71】 At least three small randomized trials suggest potential benefits for yoga in the management of pain in cancer patients [97-99]:\n【72】 ●Two of these trials included patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain after treatment for breast cancer [97] or head and neck cancer [98]; both had small sample sizes (≤42 patients), both assessed outcomes at 2 to 2.5 months, and both showed modest but significant benefits for yoga when comparing baseline versus posttreatment outcomes.\n【73】 ●In the third trial, 62 individuals with a myeloproliferative neoplasms were randomly assigned to a 12-week online yoga intervention or wait list controlled [99]. Only 48 completed the intervention (27 yoga, 21 control group). There were small effects of yoga on patient-reported pain intensity from scores at baseline, that were evident at week 7, and persisted through week 16, but it is not clear that any achieved a clinically important difference.\n【74】 The year 2022 ASCO/SIO Clinical Practice Guideline on use of integrative therapies for pain in oncology patients concluded that a trial of yoga may be offered to patients with general cancer pain/musculoskeletal pain (benefits outweigh risks, low certainty of evidence, weak recommendation) [57]. (See 'Clinical practice guidelines' below.)\n【75】 Hypnosis can be defined as an induced state of attentive, focused concentration with suspension of some peripheral awareness. Major components of the hypnotic state include absorption (capacity to contemplate deeply a selected theme or focal point), controlled alteration of one's attention, dissociation (the capacity to compartmentalize different aspects of an individual experience), and suggestibility (the capacity for heightened responsiveness to instructions). Hypnosis has been increasingly utilized for chronic and acute pain conditions and is increasingly accepted for both acute and procedure-related pain [100].\n【76】 Patients vary widely in their ability to achieve a hypnotic state. (See  \"Overview of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine practices in oncology care, and potential risks and harm\", section on 'Hypnotherapy'.)\n【77】 There is some evidence in favor of the positive effects of hypnosis on pain in cancer patients, mainly for control of procedure-related pain, but the quality of the evidence is generally low. On the other hand, few adverse events are reported with hypnosis [101].\n【78】 ●One review of hypnosis for breast cancer care, which included three randomized trials of females undergoing diagnostic breast biopsy [103,104,109], found that preprocedure hypnosis decreased perioperative pain and distress [105]. Although all studies were judged to have a low risk of bias, there was no meta-analysis to quantify benefit, and the control groups in these studies were variable, and consisted of standard care or no treatment, or a standardized attention control group.\n【79】 ●A systematic review of available data on hypnosis prior to diagnostic procedures conducted by the expert panel convened by ASCO/SIO [57] noted that of the five available trials that evaluated the use of hypnosis during procedures in cancer patients [103,104,106-108], three had methodologic weaknesses; the two most robust trials are described below:\n【80】 The expert panel concluded that hypnosis may be offered to patients experiencing pain during cancer treatment procedures or diagnostic workups (benefits outweigh harms, evidence quality intermediate, strength of recommendation moderate) [57].\n【81】 ●A systematic review evaluating the role of hypnosis in breast cancer found promising effects of hypnosis on pain and distress in females with metastatic breast cancer and concluded that hypnosis can be considered as an ancillary intervention in symptoms management related to breast cancer [105]. Three randomized trials have found modest beneficial effects on pain and distress in patients with metastatic breast cancer [111-113]. In the largest of these, 125 females with metastatic breast cancer were randomized to hypnosis plus supportive-expressive therapy or to use of self-directed educational material [112]. Over 12 months, intervention resulted in significantly less of an increase in the intensity of pain and suffering compared with the education-only group, but there were no significant effects on the frequency of pain episodes or the amount of constant pain.\n【82】 ●An analysis of the published literature performed by the NIH Technology Assessment Panel concluded that there was strong evidence to support benefit from hypnosis in management of chronic cancer pain [114]. However, a separate systematic review concluded that low methodologic quality and small sample size limited the conclusions that could be drawn from the available literature [115].\n【83】 ●In the systematic review and meta-analysis described above of a variety of MBPs, 15 of 23 hypnosis studies reported significant improvements in pain outcomes, although very few were conducted in patients with cancer pain. Meta-analytic results indicated a significant moderate association with pain reduction (mean difference in pain intensity -0.54, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.20) [44].\n【84】 ●Four randomized trials that addressed the benefit of hypnosis for pain during palliative care or radiation therapy have shown some benefit, but all were small and the benefits were modest, at best [90,112,116,117].\n【85】 Overall, it is clear that hypnosis research would benefit from more rigorous methodology, including standardization of interventions [110]. A year 2022 ASCO/SIO Clinical Practice Guideline on use of integrative therapies for pain in oncology patients concluded that while hypnosis may be offered to patients with procedural pain, the evidence in other settings was insufficient or inconclusive [57]. (See 'Clinical practice guidelines' below.)\n【86】 Relaxation techniques share two components: the repetitive focus on a word or phrase, sound, or breath, body sensation such as muscular activity, and the adoption of a passive attitude towards intrusive thoughts. As a group, relaxation techniques attempt to induce a so-called relaxation response characterized by decreased arousal and diminished sympathetic activity (eg, decreased heart rate and lower blood pressure). This is accompanied by increased electroencephalographic slow wave activity. When used therapeutically, relaxation techniques may be divided into two methods, deep and brief, or by the specific strategy used to induce the relaxed state, including progressive muscle relaxation, autogenic training, and breath training. The data are currently insufficient to conclude that any one technique is more effective than another for any given condition.\n【87】 A benefit for relaxation for cancer pain has been shown in several small randomized trials [91,92,118-120], but in some cases, the benefits have been transient. In a trial of 59 patients with cancer pain requiring opioid therapy who were randomly assigned to one of three active CBTs (distraction, positive mood, or relaxation interventions) or to a control, patients in the relaxation and distraction groups reported significantly decreased pain intensity immediately after intervention [120]. However, at two weeks after enrollment, no differences were apparent between any of the treatment groups.\n【88】 The results of systematic reviews and meta-analyses are conflicting:\n【89】 ●A year 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials evaluating progressive muscle relaxation for cancer-related outcomes included twelve studies involving 1147 patients and found significant albeit modest effects on pain (standardized mean difference -1.02, 95% CI -1.93 to -0.11) [121]. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate to very low.\n【90】 ●An earlier systematic review also concluded that relaxation techniques were effective in reducing chronic pain in a variety of medical conditions, including cancer [114].\n【91】 ●However, a later systematic literature review concluded that low methodologic quality and small sample size limited the conclusions that could be drawn from the available literature [115].\n【92】 ●In the systematic review described above, 12 of 16 relaxation studies (only four of which were conducted in patients with cancer pain) reported significant improvements in pain outcomes; however, when subjected to meta-analysis, the results were not significantly different (mean difference -0.45, 95% CI -1.13 to +0.22) [44]. (See 'Mind and body practices' above.)\n【93】 There is a small chance of adverse reactions during relaxation training:\n【94】 ●In a survey of 116 clinicians who conducted relaxation practice with 17,542 patients, the most common adverse reactions were intrusive thoughts, fear of losing control, upsetting sensory experiences, muscle cramps, sexual arousal, and psychotic symptoms [122].\n【95】 ●Adverse reactions to relaxation practice have also been described as relaxation-induced anxiety or relaxation-induced panic. In contrast to relaxation-induced anxiety, relaxation-induced panic is more severe anxiety and has a rapid onset [123]. Patients with a history of generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder and those with a history of hyperventilation are more likely to experience these adverse effects. Although the risk is small, patients with these histories should be carefully monitored during the relaxation process.\n【96】 Because of these issues, the deep breathing techniques used in relaxation training (eg, diaphragmatic breathing) should be introduced in a gradual manner. Until a relaxation technique is mastered by the patient under supervision from a clinician, patients with risk factors (eg, anxiety disorders) should be discouraged from practicing deep breathing on their own for more than a couple of minutes at a time.\n【97】 ●Imagery with or without progressive muscle relaxation – Given that benefits are likely to outweigh risks, a trial of guided imagery with progressive muscle relaxation may be offered to patients with treatment-related cancer pain, although the certainty of the evidence for benefit is very low. Benefit in other settings is unclear.\n【98】 Guided imagery utilizes recall of pleasant sights, smells, sounds, tastes, or somatic sensations (touch, movements, or positions) to create a positive cognitive and emotional state that can prevent or ameliorate pain or other sources of distress. Guided imagery practitioners use words to create states of focused attention that are thought to alter the experience of pain. Other techniques, such as distraction, mental dissociation, muscle relaxation, and controlled abdominal breathing, are also practiced as part of guided imagery.\n【99】 Two of the most common clinical imagery techniques are mental rehearsal imagery and end-state imagery.\n【100】 Published outcomes from older studies on mental rehearsal imagery were almost uniformly positive, reporting significant reductions in pain and anxiety, length of postoperative hospital stay, pain medication use, and fewer treatment-related side effects [91,115,119,125,126]. However, a systematic review concluded that low methodologic quality and small sample size limited the conclusions that could be drawn from these available studies [115].\n【101】 More recently, at least three trials suggest benefit:\n【102】 The joint ASCO/SIO guidelines panel on integrative therapy for pain in cancer patients endorsed offering guided imagery with progressive muscle relaxation to patients experiencing cancer treatment-related pain, but the small size of several studies, the inconsistent lack of blinding, and overall lack of safety data and quality concerns led the panel to conclude that the relative benefits and harms were not assessable, the evidence quality was low, and the strength of recommendation weak [57]. (See 'Clinical practice guidelines' below.)\n【103】 ●Biofeedback – The benefits of biofeedback for management of cancer pain are uncertain, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against use. However, for interested patients, a trial of biofeedback might be considered for any motivated patient with pain or distress, if the resources exist.\n【104】 Biofeedback is a form of relaxation therapy that involves the use of a machine to allow monitoring and feedback control over a specific physiologic parameter. The instrument transforms a physiologic response, such as skin temperature, into an electrical signal, which is amplified and displayed in the form of a visible and/or audible stimulus such as a changing tone, a light bar, or a moving line on a computer screen [130,131]. By monitoring the stimulus and learning to control the physiologic response that generates it, biofeedback can facilitate healthier cognitive and behavioral response patterns to pain and stress. It can help patients learn to modify the internal, subjective experience by providing corrective information to either validate the strategy that is being used to achieve a desired state (eg, relaxation) or show its inadequacy [132].\n【105】 The physiologic responses that are most commonly used for biofeedback are respiration, heart rate or pulse, peripheral skin temperature, electrical skin conductance, and muscle tension (surface electromyography [EMG]). Surface EMG biofeedback, for example, has been used for the treatment of cancer-related pain by targeting muscle groups associated with the patient's response to pain; relaxing these muscles can also help induce a general relaxation response, which can further alter pain perception or reduce anxiety [133,134]. Neurofeedback may also be accomplished using electroencephalograms [135].\n【106】 The available data on biofeedback to cancer-related pain are as follows:\n【107】 Additional studies are needed to evaluate approaches to biofeedback and the analgesic effectiveness of these approaches compared with other integrative therapies. The NIH Technology Assessment Panel and a later meta-analysis both concluded that there was only moderate evidence to support benefit from any form of biofeedback in the management of chronic cancer pain [114,115].\n【108】 The term \"meditation\" is an umbrella term that covers a large number of traditions and practices with specific evidence on their effectiveness for improved symptom management and ability to improve the stress response. They all require focused attention and involve specific training in the ability to adopt a witness stance and \"let go,\" of thoughts, feeling sensations, and external distractions. Generally, meditation involves consistent daily or regular practice. Some examples include mindfulness meditation, transcendental meditation, and Zen meditation.\n【109】 Mindfulness is the practice of focusing attention on internal or external stimuli without evaluating or judging and it can be a core component of several interventions. Among these, MBSR developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn, has been investigated in several studies. It is an eight-week, evidence-based and group intervention that uses meditation practices to increase awareness, learn self-regulation strategies, and improve adaptation to stress and physical and psychologic discomfort. This patient-centered educational and training approach essentially teaches people how to live in the moment and take better care of themselves. (See  \"Overview of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine practices in oncology care, and potential risks and harm\", section on 'Meditation and mindfulness-based stress reduction'.)\n【110】 These self-regulation practices focus on training attention and awareness to bring mental processes under greater voluntary control. Most meditation practices have four elements in common: a quiet location with few distractions; a specific, comfortable posture achieved by sitting or lying down; a focus of attention; and an open attitude of letting thoughts come and go naturally without judgment [137]. The focus of attention may be on a specific target, such as the breath or a repeated sound or mantra (known as concentration meditation); on all experiences that enter the field of awareness (called open awareness or mindfulness meditation); or a combination of both.\n【111】 Very few studies have suggested benefit for meditation in controlling pain in cancer patients:\n【112】 ●In a prospective single arm study, for example, 75 breast cancer survivors practiced Pranic meditation 20 minutes at a time, twice daily, for eight weeks and experienced a significant improvement in quality of life scores and scores for pain, as well as fatigue self-image, and sleep disturbance [138].\n【113】 ●In a retrospective analysis of 34 children receiving anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody treatment (which is associated with a high prevalence of visceral pain during the infusion) for high-risk neuroblastoma [139], 24 were able to complete 11 minutes of meditation on the first or second attempt, and this group received significantly fewer doses of analgesic medication. (See  \"Treatment and prognosis of neuroblastoma\", section on 'High-risk disease'.)\n【114】 The absence of control groups in these studies does not permit the conclusion that the observed benefits were due to the intervention, but the positive findings warrant additional research.\n【115】 By contrast, studies of mindfulness-based interventions suggest that these approaches have efficacy for cancer pain in some contexts:\n【116】 ●A meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials evaluating mindfulness-based interventions included 843 patients [140] and found significant pooled effects on pain intensity at both short-term (standard mean difference [SMD] = -0.19, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.04) and long-term (SMD = -0.20, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.05) follow-up, but no significant effects on pain interference with function. In subgroup analyses, significant intervention effects were only seen in clinic-based programs, and pooled effects on pain had a relatively small effect size. GRADE ratings showed moderate certainty of evidence in mindfulness-based interventions for pain intensity but low certainty for benefit in pain interference.\n【117】 ●A systematic review of mindfulness meditation for cancer-related pain [141], which included six randomized trials published between 2000 and 2017 in which pain was a defined primary or secondary outcome [87,142-146], came to the following conclusions:\n【118】 A more recent randomized controlled trial of MBSR in breast cancer survivors with chronic neuropathic pain found no significant differences between patients enrolled in the eight-week intervention (n = 49) as compared with patients who were in the wait list control group (n = 49) [147]. These results suggest that the effectiveness of MBSR may vary significantly across patient presentations and conditions.\n【119】 Adverse effects may also occur with meditation. In a study of a small group of meditators, participants reported a 63 percent incidence of at least one adverse event, which included disorientation, confusion, depression, increased awareness of one's negative qualities and emotions, increased fears and anxiety, boredom, and pain [148].\n【120】 Creative arts therapies attempt to ameliorate physical and emotional distress through the use of music, dance/movement, and art. Music therapy can improve pain symptoms, anxiety, and depression in a variety of populations. (See  \"Management of psychiatric disorders in patients with cancer\", section on 'Other modalities'.)\n【121】 Creative arts therapy can also improve pain and other symptoms, and improve quality of life among cancer patients, although the effect may be transient [57,149-151]. Most of the data on relief of cancer pain are with music therapy [150-157]:\n【122】 ●A 2022 systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating music therapy for physical, cognitive, and psychosocial outcomes associated with cancer, including pain [158], found that 23 of 25 included trials reported statistically and clinically significant improvements across outcome variables.\n【123】 ●A 2021 Cochrane review of music interventions (defined as music therapy offered by trained music therapists) for improving psychologic and physical outcomes in people with cancer included 81 trials with a total of 5576 participants; 74 trials involved adults and 7 trials included children [157]. There was a moderate pain-reducing effect of music interventions (12 studies, 632 adult participants; SMD, on a 0 to 10 point VAS scale, -0.67, 95% CI -1.07 to -0.26, very low certainty evidence).\n【124】 ●The benefit of music therapy for postsurgical pain has been addressed in three trials [159-161]:\n【125】 While all three studies showed a significant effect of music therapy in improving surgical pain scores over usual care, two trials had a high risk of bias [160,161], and the third was very small [159].\n【126】 Notably, all of these trials just used prerecorded music, and did not employ a trained music therapist to deliver a specific music therapy intervention. (See  \"Overview of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine practices in oncology care, and potential risks and harm\", section on 'Music therapy'.)\n【127】 A year 2022 ASCO/SIO Clinical Practice Guideline on use of integrative therapies for pain in oncology patients concluded that music therapy may be offered to patients with postsurgical pain, but that the evidence in other settings was insufficient or inconclusive [57].\n【128】 Other potential benefits of music therapy for cancer symptoms and treatment-related side effects are addressed elsewhere. (See  \"Overview of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine practices in oncology care, and potential risks and harm\", section on 'Music therapy'.)\n【129】 The benefits of dance/movement therapy are less certain. A Cochrane review of three studies totaling 207 participants that focused on dance/movement therapy provided to patients with cancer by a formally trained dance/movement therapist concluded that there was no demonstrable effect on mood, mental health, body image, fatigue, or pain [162].\n【130】 Massage therapy has been used as a form of medical therapy since ancient times. Some of the earliest references are found in ancient Chinese medical texts. The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine, written more than 2500 years ago and believed to be the first book on Chinese medicine, includes information on Tuina, an ancient form of massage and acupressure (applied finger pressure to points that are putatively sensitized by organ impairment) [163].\n【131】 Massage is defined as the systematic manipulation of the soft tissues of the body to enhance health and healing [164]. It includes a group of manual techniques that include applying fixed or movable pressure. The primary characteristics are the application of touch and movement. The goals of massage therapy are to promote relaxation, address muscle stiffness and pain, and resolve musculoskeletal complaints.\n【132】 Some studies conducted with adult and pediatric patients with both limited and advanced cancer have suggested that massage can yield at least temporary benefit for pain, other symptoms, and mood [165-171]; however, others have not [172-174], and methodologic limitations preclude definitive conclusions about outcomes in many of these studies [115,175]. The bulk of the data are in patients with breast cancer and those receiving palliative care.\n【133】 ●In a quasi-experimental study of 70 post-breast surgery patients, 35 were randomized to receiving oral analgesics only and 35 received oral analgesics and foot massage; pain and analgesic use were significantly lower in the latter group [171].\n【134】 ●A small randomized trial in 42 advanced cancer patients (22 with breast cancer) found that massage therapy transiently improved quality of life compared with no touch control or usual care, but there was no significant change in pain scores from baseline to one-week or one-month follow-up times [176].\n【135】 ●A 2016 Cochrane review that evaluated the effects of massage with or without the addition of aromatherapy on pain and other symptoms (eg, anxiety and depression) in patients with cancer (the majority with breast cancer) concluded that there is a lack of evidence due to low reliability of studies and poor methodologic quality [175].\n【136】 ●On the other hand, a later systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized trials (total 127 patients) with chronic musculoskeletal pain after breast cancer treatment did find a benefit for massage therapy [177]. The interventions included myofascial induction, myofascial release, classic massage, ischemic compression of trigger points, and myofascial therapy; controls included an educational session, physical therapy, or sham massage. Massage therapy significantly reduced pain but the effect size was small to moderate (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.06-0.57) compared with controls.\n【137】 ●A year 2009 systematic review of 14 trials (mostly low-quality) concluded on the basis of four trials that there is evidence that massage therapy can alleviate various types of pain in palliative care patients [178].\n【138】 The largest of these studies [169] was a multisite randomized trial that in which 380 patients with advanced cancer who were experiencing moderate to severe pain were randomly assigned to either six 30-minute massage sessions or simple-touch sessions over two weeks. A total of 298 patients were included in the immediate outcome analysis and 348 were included in the sustained outcome analysis. Both groups demonstrated immediate improvement in pain (on a 0 to 10 point scale), massage decreased pain (-1.87, 95% CI -2.07 to -1.67) as did simple touch (-0.97, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.76), mean pain difference 0.90, p <0.001. However, there was no significant difference in sustained pain relief between the groups. The authors concluded that massage may have immediately beneficial effects on pain and mood in a population with advanced cancer, but given the lack of sustained effects, the potential benefits of attention and simple touch should also be considered.\n【139】 ●A later systematic review included three randomized trials of massage therapy for pain in patients receiving palliative care [179], one of which was included in the above systematic review [169]. All three trials showed favorable results for massage.\n【140】 Clinicians who refer a cancer patient to a massage therapist should ensure that information about potential risk is transmitted to the therapist. The therapist should individualize treatment to minimize risk and specifically avoid vulnerable areas.\n【141】 Importantly, there is no scientific evidence supporting the existence of the energy field thought to play a role in Reiki. Proponents of Reiki suggest that it can reduce stress and induce a relaxation response, which may be therapeutic in a manner similar to other MBPs. The Reiki practitioner can provide a calm and reassuring presence. Additionally, they will typically attune their breathing to the patient's and progressively slowing and deepening their breath, which can have a beneficial effect on the patient's well-being.\n【142】 Reiki for patients with cancer has received increasing interest in clinical settings, including palliative care, but the limited data on effectiveness and the lack of large and well-controlled studies prevent drawing firm conclusions as to its benefits for pain management [180,181]. The following data are available:\n【143】 ●In the only randomized trial, 24 patients with cancer pain received either standard opioid therapy plus rest or opioid therapy plus two Reiki treatments one hour after their first afternoon analgesic dose [182]. The addition of Reiki to opioid therapy significantly reduced pain, but not opioid use, immediately after treatment. The statistical power of the study to demonstrate benefits such as this was limited because the study was terminated prematurely because of the unwillingness of patients to be randomly assigned to the control arm.\n【144】 ●A review of seven randomized trials of Reiki, which included the study above, evaluated the technique as a treatment for pain and anxiety in cancer patients, postsurgical patients, and community-dwelling older adults [183]. Although the quality of the studies was limited, a comparison of effect sizes led the authors to conclude that Reiki may be effective for pain and anxiety.\n【145】 ●A mixed-method study that evaluated the impact of a volunteer-based Reiki program on 213 cancer patients who were receiving treatment for the first time found an immediate decrease in pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and distress [184]; most patients reported that they liked the session, found it helpful, planned on receiving more sessions, and would recommend Reiki to others.\n【146】 ●Another study explored the impact of Reiki on patients attending an oncology clinic for chemotherapy treatment [185]. Twenty-two of 118 patients enrolled received the full cycle of four Reiki treatments. Their mean anxiety score decreased from 6.77 to 2.28 (p <0.000001) and their mean pain score decreased from 4.4 to 2.32 (p = 0.0191).\n【147】 ●A 2008 Cochrane review included some studies conducted in cancer patients and concluded that touch therapies such as Reiki may have a modest effect in pain relief, but that more studies were needed [186].\n【148】 Nonetheless, some observations support the view that cancer patients may perceive benefit when this approach is tried [189-191]. A single randomized trial evaluating therapeutic massage also assessed healing touch as a separate intervention for symptom control in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy, the majority for breast cancer [172]. This study included 230 subjects with cancer pain who were randomly assigned to therapeutic massage, healing touch (eight 45 minute sessions, by a specifically trained registered nurse), presence alone, or standard care. Of the 56 patients assigned to healing touch who completed all eight sessions, compared with both control and presence alone, healing touch provided significantly better immediate pain reduction compared with the pretreatment baseline, but the intervention effects were not sustained over four weeks either in the pain index or the interference in living due to pain.\n【149】 There is sparse research about the adverse effects of homeopathy. However, initial and temporary worsening of symptoms before improvement is noted (ie homeopathic aggravations), and is frequently reported in trials and case reports. Additionally, a case report seems to suggest that ethanol in homeopathic preparations may interact with escitalopram, as they are both metabolized by enzymes CYP450 [192].\n【150】 Derived from the Greek words Homoios, \"similar\" and Pathos, \"suffering,\" homeopathy was founded by the German physician Samuel Hahnemann in the 1790s. It is based on the premise that cure can result from stimulation of the body's natural healing abilities. This is achieved by introducing into the body a substance that, in a healthy person, can induce symptoms that are identical to the symptoms of the disease. The philosophical foundations of homeopathy can be found in Hippocrates' teachings of the Law of Similars, or \"like cures like.\" It is also based on the \"law of minimum dose,\" the notion that the lower the dose of the medication, the greater its effectiveness. Thus, homeopathic remedies are dilutions of substances that are derived from plants, minerals, and animals; patients are prescribed the remedies that most closely match their symptom profile. (See  \"Overview of complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine practices in oncology care, and potential risks and harm\", section on 'Homeopathy' and  \"Homeopathy\".)\n【151】 Homeopathy is one of the most popular complementary/integrative therapies chosen to address chemotherapy side effects among cancer patients in Europe [193]. Similarly, its use is prevalent in Italy [194], Germany [195], and the United Kingdom [196]. Despite its popularity, the evidence to support benefit from homeopathy in patients with cancer and cancer treatment-related pain is very limited:\n【152】 ●A 2022 systematic review of 18 trials with a total of 2016 patients found that the majority of studies had low methodologic quality and concluded that the available evidence was inconclusive and failed to provide a scientifically based hypothesis for the use of homeopathy in cancer care [197].\n【153】 ●One case report series and two small prospective observational studies found that homeopathy was helpful in controlling posttreatment pain and radiation-induced itching, and in relieving adverse effects associated with estrogen withdrawal in breast cancer patients [198-200].\n【154】 ●However, a systematic review of six trials in which homeopathy was used as a sole or adjunctive treatment in cancer care concluded that methodologic quality was variable and the evidence was insufficient to recommend its use in any setting [201].\n【155】 ●A randomized trial that studied the effectiveness of Arnica montana on pain and other outcomes after mastectomy for breast cancer (n = 53) found that surgical drainage was lower among those receiving the Arnica montana, but other outcomes (including pain) were unaffected [202].\n【156】 ●A pilot observational study explored the homeopathic remedies Ruta graveolens 5CH and Rhus toxicodendron 9CH for reducing joint pain and stiffness in 40 females taking aromatase inhibitors who received the treatment for three months; relative to a comparison group, the treated females experienced a significant decrease in pain scores and a more rapid disappearance of morning stiffness [203].\n【157】 These outcomes may be nonspecific or related to placebo effects. The NCCIH considers that there is little evidence to support homeopathy as an effective treatment for any specific health condition. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to better understand the potential contribution of homeopathy to management of cancer and cancer treatment-related pain, and to understand the adverse effect profile.\n【158】 As an example, a systematic review of cancer pain clinical practice guidelines identified 11 that made recommendations for the use of complementary or alternative medicine therapies [204]. These guidelines recommended acupuncture (n = 8), mind-body modalities (n = 7), application of heat or cold (n = 6), massage (n = 6), distraction and relaxation techniques (n = 3), music therapy (n = 3), behavioral and cognitive therapies (n = 3), coping skills training (n = 1), exercise (n = 1), yoga (n = 1), capsaicin (n = 1), emotional counseling (n = 1), and herbal remedies (n = 1). Using the AGREE II tool to assess 23 characteristics of these guidelines, the authors noted significant variability in quality, content, and evidence level.\n【159】 Nonetheless, two guidelines from expert groups may be worthy of consultation:\n【160】 ●A 2017 clinical practice guideline on the use of integrative therapies in patients during and after breast cancer treatment from the SIO rated the strength of available evidence for each integrative modality based upon a modified version of the recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force [48]. They emphasized the continued lack of A- or B-graded (ie, high-quality) integrative therapies for cancer and cancer treatment-associated pain compared with an earlier guideline [82]. Healing touch for postchemotherapy pain, music therapy and hypnosis for postsurgery pain, and acupuncture for aromatase inhibitor-related pain and for pain after surgery each received a \"C\" grade (weak evidence of benefit) due primarily to a lack of multiple large trials. The authors concluded that these modalities could be offered or recommended to selected patients based on the understanding that they may bring a small benefit. Of note, music therapy, meditation, and yoga received higher grades for the evidence-based treatment of anxiety and stress, as well as depression and mood disorder.\n【161】 These guidelines were subsequently endorsed by the ASCO in 2018 [149].\n【162】 ●A later joint guideline from ASCO and SIO that covered evidence-based recommendations for integrative medicine for pain management in a broader range of cancer patients was subsequently published in 2022 [57]. The evidence quality was judged low to intermediate for most interventions, and most recommendations were weak or moderate. The specific recommendations are summarized in the table (table 2), outlined in the algorithm (algorithm 1), and discussed in more detail in the sections below. Recommendations that are sorted by type of pain and stratified according to the quality of evidence and strength of the recommendation are outlined in the table (table 3).\n【163】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

For many patients with moderate to severe cancer pain, a multimodality approach that includes nonpharmacologic therapies in conjunction with opioids may improve pain relief with fewer drug side effects, and/or provide better outcomes with regard to physical and psychosocial functioning.\n【166】 Nonpharmacologic therapies treatments that target pain etiology (eg, radiotherapy), invasive symptom-directed therapies (eg, nerve blocks), and noninvasive symptomatic therapies, such as rehabilitation and complementary/integrative therapies.

Use with caution in patients with prior drug-induced bone marrow suppression. Infection or neutropenic fever due to neutropenia or bleeding due to thrombocytopenia may occur.\n【83】 • Cytarabine syndrome: Cytarabine (ARA-C) syndrome is characterized by fever, myalgia, bone pain, chest pain (occasionally), maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, and malaise; generally occurs 6 to 12 hours following administration.\n【84】 • GI toxicities: Toxicities (less serious) include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, oral ulcerations, and hepatic dysfunction.\n【85】 • Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis resulting in acute cardiopulmonary arrest has been reported (rare).\n【86】 • Pancreatitis: There have been reports of acute pancreatitis in patients receiving continuous infusion cytarabine and in patients receiving cytarabine who were previously treated with L-asparaginase.\n【87】 • Sudden respiratory distress syndrome: Sudden respiratory distress, rapidly progressing to pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly, has been reported with high-dose cytarabine. May present as severe dyspnea with a rapid onset and refractory hypoxia with diffuse pulmonary infiltrates, leading to respiratory failure; may be fatal (Morgan 2011).\n【88】 • Tumor lysis syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome and subsequent hyperuricemia may occur.\n【89】 • Drug-drug interactions: There have been case reports of fatal cardiomyopathy when high-dose cytarabine was used in combination with cyclophosphamide as a preparation regimen for transplantation.\n【90】 • Pediatric: Delayed progressive ascending paralysis has been reported in two children who received combination chemotherapy with IV and intrathecal cytarabine at conventional doses for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (was fatal in one patient).\n【91】 • Benzyl alcohol: Some products may contain benzyl alcohol; do not use products containing benzyl alcohol or products reconstituted with bacteriostatic diluent intrathecally or for high-dose cytarabine regimens. Benzyl alcohol is associated with gasping syndrome in premature infants.\n【92】 • Experienced providers: Administer under the supervision of experienced cancer chemotherapy providers. Due to the potential toxicities, induction treatment with cytarabine should be in a facility with sufficient laboratory and supportive resources.\n【93】 • High-dose treatment: High-dose regimens have been associated with GI, CNS, pulmonary, ocular (reversible corneal toxicity and hemorrhagic conjunctivitis; prophylaxis with ophthalmic corticosteroids is recommended) toxicities, and cardiomyopathy. Neurotoxicity associated with high-dose treatment may present as acute cerebellar toxicity (with or without cerebral impairment), personality changes, or may be severe with seizure and/or coma; may be delayed, occurring up to 3 to 8 days after treatment has begun; possibly irreversible.

Limb and ear defects have been noted in case reports of cytarabine exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. The following have also been noted in the neonate: Pancytopenia, WBC depression, electrolyte abnormalities, prematurity, low birth weight, decreased hematocrit or platelets. Risk to the fetus is decreased if treatment can be avoided during the first trimester.\n【203】 Monitoring Parameters\n【204】 Liver function tests, CBC with differential and platelet count, serum creatinine, BUN, serum uric acid; signs of neurotoxicity\n【205】 Mechanism of Action\n【206】 Cytarabine inhibits DNA synthesis. Cytarabine gains entry into cells by a carrier process, and then must be converted to its active compound, aracytidine triphosphate. Cytarabine is a pyrimidine analog and is incorporated into DNA; however, the primary action is inhibition of DNA polymerase resulting in decreased DNA synthesis and repair. The degree of cytotoxicity correlates linearly with incorporation into DNA; therefore, incorporation into the DNA is responsible for drug activity and toxicity. Cytarabine is specific for the S phase of the cell cycle (blocks progression from the G1 to the S phase).\n【207】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【208】 Absorption: Not effective when administered orally; less than 20% absorbed orally.\n【209】 Distribution: Vd: 3 ± 11.9 L/kg; total body water; widely and rapidly since it enters the cells readily; crosses blood-brain barrier with CSF levels of 40% to 50% of plasma level.\n【210】 Bioavailability: SubQ: 89% to 100% (Leveque 2014).\n【211】 Protein binding: 13%.\n【212】 Metabolism: Primarily hepatic; metabolized by deoxycytidine kinase and other nucleotide kinases to aracytidine triphosphate (active); about 86% to 96% of dose is metabolized to inactive uracil arabinoside (ARA-U); intrathecal administration results in little conversion to ARA-U due to the low levels of deaminase in the cerebral spinal fluid.\n【213】 Half-life elimination: IV: Initial: 7 to 20 minutes; Terminal: 1 to 3 hours; Intrathecal: 2 to 6 hours.\n【214】 Time to peak, plasma: SubQ: 20 to 60 minutes.\n【215】 Excretion: Urine (~80%; 90% as metabolite ARA-U) within 24 hours.", "title": "Cytarabine (conventional)  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/cytarabine-conventional-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E9%A3%9F%E7%AE%A1%E6%BA%83%E7%96%A1&source=search_result&selectedTitle=85%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

While still not commonplace, a dramatic increase occurred early in the HIV pandemic and R. equi has increasingly been appreciated, especially as an opportunistic pathogen. Increasing recognition of R. equi as a pathogen has subsequently led to improved laboratory identification of infections in both immunocompromised and normal humans.\n【2】 The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of R. equi infections will be reviewed here. The microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of R. equi infections are discussed separately. (See  \"Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Rhodococcus equi infections\".)\n【3】 CLINICAL FEATURES — R. equi has increasingly been appreciated as a cause of infection in patients with immune system dysfunction [3-13]. The majority of R. equi infections occur in adults, but infection in children and infants (including preterm infants) has also been reported [14]. Although such patients often have epidemiologic risk factors for disease (eg, contact with horses), disease has been reported even in those without a known exposure [13]. (See  \"Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Rhodococcus equi infections\".)\n【4】 Pulmonary infections are the most common form of human disease caused by R. equi. Extrapulmonary disease, with or without a concurrent pulmonary infection, can also occur. In one large review of 72 cases, pneumonia occurred in 76 percent of patients, and the lung was the sole site of infection in 82 percent [7]. Pneumonia was accompanied by extrapulmonary infection in 18 percent of cases, while infection at extrapulmonary sites occurred without evidence of pulmonary involvement in 24 percent.\n【5】 Immunocompromised hosts\n【6】 Pulmonary infection — Most published cases of pneumonia have occurred in immunocompromised hosts, including transplant recipients (both solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell recipients) [13,15,16]. In such patients, infection is typically subacute in onset but results in high fever, cough (which may or may not be productive), and prominent fatigue [3-11]. Chest pain and weight loss are also common [17].\n【7】 Hemoptysis can occur in some patients, and is sometimes severe enough to require multiple transfusions and even pneumonectomy. In a series of 67 HIV-infected patients with R. equi infection, cough, sputum production, and hemoptysis were present in 88, 85, and 31 percent, respectively [12]. However, in a case-control study that evaluated 18 transplant patients, none had hemoptysis [13].\n【8】 A number of local complications can occur in R. equi pulmonary infection. Cavitation arises in greater than 50 percent of cases and pleural effusion in approximately 20 percent. Invasion of contiguous chest structures (chest wall, pericardium, mediastinum) and recurrent pneumothorax are unusual complications. In endemic regions, this can mimic tuberculosis. (See 'Differential diagnosis' below.)\n【9】 Malakoplakia, a rare chronic granulomatous condition, can also occur in the setting of R. equi infection. Although malakoplakia is a nonspecific finding when seen elsewhere [18], when seen in lung parenchyma, it is generally more specific to R. equi. Pulmonary masses from malakoplakia may mimic lung tumors [19]. Pathologically, malakoplakia appears as a dense tissue infiltrate, comprising sheets of foamy histiocytes, with abundant cytoplasm-containing coccobacilli, and extra- or intracellular, target-like, calcific inclusions (Michaelis Gutmann bodies) that likely represent infected phagocytes with ingested bacteria which likely behave as a nidus for mineralization [20].\n【10】 Extrapulmonary infection — The signs and symptoms of extrapulmonary infection depend upon whether the patient has concurrent pulmonary disease.\n【11】 With concurrent pulmonary infection — For immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infection, the most common extrapulmonary sites are the skin (subcutaneous abscesses) and brain. Brain abscesses, surrounding cerebral edema, and sometimes meningitis [21] may result in a variety of neurologic symptoms such as confusion, agitation, obtundation, coma, seizures, and motor weakness. Kidney and bone involvement, as well as isolated bacteremia, may also be seen. (See 'Diagnosis' below.)\n【12】 Extrapulmonary manifestations can occur at various times during infection. As examples:\n【13】 Patients without pulmonary infection — Extrapulmonary infections not associated with pulmonary disease have been reported in approximately 25 percent of patients with R. equi infection [7]. They can be categorized by several patterns, including:\n【14】 Primary inoculation via the lungs or gastrointestinal tract with spread to regional lymph nodes can also occur. Although infection may be asymptomatic [30], patients can present with cervical, thoracic, or mesenteric lymphadenitis [31-33]; peritonitis [34,35]; and pelvic and/or paraspinous masses, which may also involve adjacent bone [32,36,37]. Rare cases of osteomyelitis have been described [38]. Relapse after discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy can occur [31,34,37].\n【15】 Immunocompetent hosts — Pneumonia due to R. equi has been described in immunocompetent hosts [7,39-41]. However, this is uncommon, representing only about 10 percent of cases in the literature. Most reported cases have had cavitary lesions on chest roentgenograms, and have recovered with either prolonged antibiotic therapy or lobectomy without antibiotics. Extrapulmonary complications are rarely reported.\n【16】 DIAGNOSIS — A diagnosis of R. equi infection should be suspected in immunocompromised patients with cavitary lung disease and epidemiologic risk factors for disease [17]. (See 'Clinical features' above and  \"Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Rhodococcus equi infections\", section on 'Microbiology'.)\n【17】 A diagnosis is typically made by culturing the organism from a clinical specimen. R. equi is easily cultivated on ordinary nonselective media when incubated aerobically at 37ºC. (See  \"Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Rhodococcus equi infections\", section on 'Microbiology'.)\n【18】 The sites of infection and the specimens from which R. equi can be isolated include [3-12]:\n【19】 Blood cultures are positive in more than one-half of immunocompromised patients with R. equi infection compared with only 10 percent of normal hosts [7,13]. Patients with AIDS have the highest rate of accompanying bacteremia. The magnitude of the bacteremia may correlate with the risk of hematogenous dissemination. Occasionally, the isolation of R. equi from blood or tissue is the first clue to the etiology of an infection. If R. equi infection is diagnosed in an apparently normal host, further evaluation of the patient's immune status should be pursued. (See  \"Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Rhodococcus equi infections\", section on 'Immune response' and  \"Laboratory evaluation of the immune system\", section on 'Evaluation for specific types of disorders'.)\n【20】 One of the most important factors in the timely diagnosis of R. equi infection is communication between clinicians and laboratory personnel. Although the organism is easy to grow, it can easily be dismissed as a contaminant, given its appearance as a diphtheroid. In addition, Rhodococcus are sometimes called \"aerobic actinomycetes\" [20]. (See  \"Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Rhodococcus equi infections\", section on 'Microbiology'.)\n【21】 Newer technologies, such as 16S rRNA sequencing and Mass Absorption Laser Depolarizing Ionization time-of-flight, may also be useful to diagnose \"difficult to identify\" bacteria from clinical specimens, or (for 16S rRNA sequencing) to identify the etiology of culture-negative infections. (See  \"Approach to Gram stain and culture results in the microbiology laboratory\", section on 'MALDI-TOF'.)\n【22】 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — For immunocompromised patients with cavitary lung disease, the differential diagnosis includes fungal, bacterial, and mycobacterial pathogens. The clinical presentation of these different infections depends in part upon the type of immunosuppression. As examples:\n【23】 ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY — The mainstay of treatment for R. equi is antimicrobial therapy. Adjunctive therapies are described below. (See 'Adjunctive treatment interventions' below.)\n【24】 Multiple antibiotics can be used for the treatment of R. equi infections. Methods for determining in vitro susceptibilities are not standardized, and there are no established Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines for antibiotic testing for this organism. However, several series using disc diffusion and/or minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) techniques have found that R. equi is usually susceptible in vitro to erythromycin and extended spectrum macrolides, rifampin, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, glycopeptides (ie, vancomycin), linezolid, and imipenem [2-10,44]. Bactericidal agents against R. equi include vancomycin, amikacin, gentamicin, and fluoroquinolones [45].\n【25】 Of concern, increased rates of multidrug-resistant R. equi have been reported in horses on breeding farms in the United States where mass macrolide/rifampin prophylaxis is used [46].\n【26】 Treatment of immunocompromised hosts — We suggest combination antimicrobial therapy with at least two agents in immunocompromised hosts given concerns for emerging resistance. One report from Taiwan that described susceptibility patterns in 13 R. equi isolates noted the emergence of multidrug-resistant R. equi [11]. The emergence of resistance during treatment has also been demonstrated with doxycycline [6], rifampin [47], and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) [2]. One study showed significantly more TMP-SMX resistance in Europe than the United States [41].\n【27】 The ultimate combination should be based upon in vitro data regarding susceptibility, synergy, and antagonism. In vitro, the combination of a macrolide with rifampin considerably decreases the emergence of resistant mutants [48]. Studies in the veterinary literature (where combination therapy is frequently recommended) have found in vitro combinations that include a macrolide (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin) with either rifampin or doxycycline, or the combination of doxycycline plus rifampin were synergistic [45]. By contrast, amikacin, when administered with a macrolide or rifampin, or the combination of gentamicin plus rifampin were antagonistic.\n【28】 Preferred agents — For initial therapy, we administer a macrolide or fluoroquinolone in combination with rifampin or in combination with two of the following: vancomycin, imipenem, linezolid, or an aminoglycoside. Use of antibiotics with intracellular activity, such as rifampin, fluoroquinolones, and azithromycin may be particularly useful because survival within histiocytes is a significant virulence determinant in R. equi pathogenesis [49-51]. (See  \"Microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of Rhodococcus equi infections\", section on 'Pathogenesis'.)\n【29】 Once susceptibility data are available, two active agents should be continued; at least one of these should be a macrolide or quinolone if possible. For patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, it is important that the second agent has good CNS penetration (eg, imipenem, vancomycin, rifampin, or linezolid) since macrolide and fluoroquinolone penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid is generally poor. The duration of therapy is described below (see 'Duration' below). Specific considerations regarding the individual agents include:\n【30】 While on therapy, patients should be monitored for toxicity. As an example, monitoring of the QT interval is recommended when a patient is on multiple agents that may prolong the QT interval (macrolides, fluoroquinolones). Additional monitoring depends upon the specific agent that is used.\n【31】 Alternative agents — Additional agents that can be considered in the setting of allergies or other drug intolerances include doxycycline, TMP-SMX, meropenem, and amoxicillin-clavulanate or ampicillin-sulbactam. Rates of resistance to clindamycin likely preclude use of this agent until susceptibility has been demonstrated. Beta-lactams (such as cephalosporins) should generally be avoided, even if initial susceptibility testing is favorable, since resistance has been shown to develop during therapy [32,53,54].\n【32】 Duration — Initial therapy in immunocompromised persons should last at least two months due to the frequency of relapses following shorter courses. However, radiographic improvement is needed to help guide the ultimate duration of treatment, and patients should have repeat imaging (eg, chest computed tomography [CT], brain magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) prior to discontinuing therapy. Longer courses should be administered to patients who have persistent clinical or radiographic evidence of infection.\n【33】 Secondary prophylaxis should be administered to patients who remain immunosuppressed, as such patients are likely to suffer relapses. The duration of prophylaxis has not been studied, but should potentially continue for the duration of immunosuppression. For organ transplant recipients, this may be lifelong. (See 'Secondary prevention' below.)\n【34】 The duration of treatment is based largely upon case reports of patients with prolonged immunosuppression who had complex disease. Some experts have postulated that 10 to 14 days of treatment may be adequate therapy for simple infections (ie, no pulmonary masses or cavitary lesions) in patients who are unlikely to be immunosuppressed for a prolonged period of time (eg, a patient with HIV on antiretroviral therapy) [55]. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of shorter treatment courses, and we continue to administer prolonged courses pending further data.\n【35】 Treatment of immunocompetent hosts — In immunocompetent persons, single-agent therapy with an extended-spectrum macrolide or fluoroquinolone is typically sufficient [56]. Duration may range from two to eight weeks (or longer), depending on the extent of disease, which should be monitored by clinical and radiographic exams. More detailed information regarding the specific agents is found above. (See 'Preferred agents' above.)\n【36】 ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT INTERVENTIONS\n【37】 Improving immune function — Improving the host's immune function can be an important therapeutic adjunct in treating R. equi infections since the immune status of the host may have a substantial impact upon the outcome of the infection. This can be accomplished by reducing the use of immunosuppressive medications or in patients with AIDS, initiating antiretroviral therapy. In one case, an immune reconstitution syndrome secondary to Rhodococcus was reported with HIV [57]. (See  \"Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome\".)\n【38】 Chronic or fatal outcomes have been reported in approximately 70 to 80 percent of immunocompromised hosts [7]. By contrast, hosts with normal immune function generally can be cured of R. equi infection. In a series of 67 HIV-infected patients, 23 patients died of R. equi infection; however, none of these deaths occurred in patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy [12].\n【39】 Drainage/resection — In some circumstances, surgical resection of infected tissue combined with antimicrobial therapy has improved survival in patients with R. equi infection [3,58,59]. Resection may be particularly beneficial when lung infection has evolved into an inflammatory pseudotumor or large abscess [59]. Drainage procedures for localized abscesses and empyemas have also proven helpful in selected cases.\n【40】 Resection alone has been curative in rare cases of lung infection. Whether additional antimicrobial therapy might decrease the risk of surgical site complications, including bronchopleural fistulae, has not been studied, but would generally be included in many situations.\n【41】 Extrapulmonary disease — In addition to antimicrobial therapy and improving immune function, there are specific treatment considerations for certain extrapulmonary manifestations. The extrapulmonary manifestations of R. equi infection are described above. (See 'Extrapulmonary infection' above.)\n【42】 Drainage of infected sites, where feasible, may hasten resolution when used in conjunction with antibiotics. For patients with peritoneal catheter infections, antibiotic therapy for greater than two weeks may be curative without catheter removal, but removal may be required in some cases. In cases of meningitis refractory to systemic therapy, vancomycin via Ommaya reservoir has been used [60].\n【43】 PREVENTION\n【44】 Primary prevention — Among HIV-infected patients, the best way to prevent infection with R. equi is early initiation of antiretroviral therapy to preserve immunologic function [41]. (See  \"When to initiate antiretroviral therapy in persons with HIV\" and  \"Selecting antiretroviral regimens for treatment-naïve persons with HIV-1: General approach\".)\n【45】 Prospective evaluation of other approaches to prevent R. equi infection cannot be conducted since the infection occurs relatively infrequently and sporadically. However, immunocompromised persons living or working in environments near horses and other grazing animals should be advised about reducing exposure. In addition, lung transplant patients are sometimes maintained on long-term azithromycin (primarily for anti-inflammatory properties), which might be preventative.\n【46】 Secondary prevention — Secondary prophylaxis should be administered to patients who are persistently immunocompromised, even if the patient appears to have achieved a full clinical remission of R. equi infection with initial treatment. Although there have been cases of cure without prolonged secondary prophylaxis in immunocompromised hosts [49], cases of relapsing disease in immunocompromised hosts are not uncommon [61]. (See 'Antimicrobial therapy' above.)\n【47】 Antimicrobial therapy for secondary prophylaxis should consist of a single oral agent that has demonstrated in vitro activity against the specific isolate. Azithromycin and trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole would be common agents for secondary prophylaxis. Fluoroquinolones could also be considered, balancing the risk of tendinopathy. Linezolid and rifampin would be unlikely to be tolerated on a long-term basis, given the predilection for side effects (eg, bone marrow suppression) and drug interactions.\n【48】 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n【49】 ACKNOWLEDGMENT — The editorial staff at UpToDate acknowledge Leonard Slater, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.", "title": "Clinical features, diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of Rhodococcus equi infections", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-therapy-and-prevention-of-rhodococcus-equi-infections?search=%E4%BA%BA%E7%B1%BB%E5%81%8F%E8%82%BA%E7%97%85%E6%AF%92%E5%BC%95%E8%B5%B7%E7%9A%84%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E&source=search_result&selectedTitle=84%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": 2025, "text": "url: http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-beyond-the-basics?search=%E7%BB%A7%E5%8F%91%E6%80%A7%E7%94%B2%E7%8A%B6%E6%97%81%E8%85%BA%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E4%BA%A2%E8%BF%9B%E7%97%87&source=search_result&selectedTitle=139%7E139&usage_type=default\n【0】 Patient education  Primary hyperparathyroidism (Beyond the Basics)\n【1】 HYPERPARATHYROIDISM OVERVIEW — The parathyroid glands (figure 1) make a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH), which helps control the amount of calcium in the blood. In people with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), one or more of the parathyroid glands become overactive and secrete excess amounts of hormone. As a result, the blood calcium rises to a level that is higher than normal; this is called hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause many short-term and long-term complications.\n【2】 Primary hyperparathyroidism is different from secondary hyperparathyroidism, which occurs when the parathyroid glands appropriately respond to a reduced blood calcium level. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is characterized biochemically by elevated parathyroid hormone levels and normal or low blood calcium levels. In this situation, the low calcium level is caused by another condition, such as calcium not being absorbed correctly from the intestines or kidney failure. In these situations, the parathyroid glands are responding appropriately and are not diseased.\n【3】 This article discusses the causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism.\n【4】 WHAT ARE THE PARATHYROID GLANDS? — Four parathyroid glands are located in the neck, two on each side (figure 1). Rarely, a person has five or six parathyroid glands in the neck, and occasionally one or more parathyroid glands located within the chest cavity. The parathyroid glands secrete a hormone called parathyroid hormone (PTH) that helps the body maintain a normal blood calcium level.\n【5】 When the blood calcium level drops, the normal response is for the parathyroid glands to release PTH; this raises the blood calcium level back to normal by pulling calcium out of bone and reducing calcium excretion by the kidneys. When the blood calcium level rises, less PTH is released by the parathyroid glands, causing the kidneys to retain less calcium. These actions help keep the body's calcium level within a normal range.\n【6】 PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM CAUSES — Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) can be caused by several conditions, including:\n【7】 PHPT can occur at any age but is more common in females who have been through menopause (and no longer have monthly periods). At younger ages, PHPT is often caused by a familial hyperparathyroidism syndrome, which usually causes several of the parathyroid glands to enlarge rather than a single gland to become enlarged. In familial hyperparathyroidism, there is also a possibility of abnormalities of other endocrine glands, including the pituitary, thyroid, pancreas, or adrenal glands.\n【8】 PHPT has been reported in people who have had past radiation to the head and neck (eg, to treat childhood cancer, to treat certain benign conditions, or after nuclear power plant accidents). People who have been exposed to radiation are more likely to have thyroid nodules (growths on the thyroid gland) as well as PHPT. If thyroid nodules are also present, they may impact the interpretation of some tests and the choice of treatment of PHPT.\n【9】 PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM SYMPTOMS — Approximately 80 percent of people with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) have few or no symptoms. In these people, PHPT is typically diagnosed after an elevated calcium is detected when a blood test is done for some other reason. Most often, the calcium level is only mildly elevated or is elevated intermittently. People with long-standing vitamin D deficiency and PHPT often have more symptoms.\n【10】 There are sometimes nonspecific symptoms that might be related to the elevated calcium level, including:\n【11】 Symptoms become more noticeable as the parathyroid hormone (PTH) and blood calcium levels rise. At higher levels of PTH and blood calcium, there may be a significant loss of appetite, nausea, constipation, excessive thirst, or frequent urination. In addition, a person may develop:\n【12】 Parathyroid crisis — Parathyroid crisis is a rare condition that sometimes occurs when people with PHPT experience another illness, like a viral infection that causes vomiting or diarrhea, which leads to excessive fluid loss or severely limits the amount of fluid they can consume.\n【13】 During parathyroid crisis, blood PTH and calcium levels rise sharply to very high levels, causing severe symptoms of hypercalcemia. Most notably, there is a significant change in thinking and alertness, ranging from confusion to coma. Some people also experience severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach ulcers, and pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).\n【14】 Parathyroid crisis must be treated quickly by replacing lost body fluids and removing the overactive parathyroid tissue.\n【15】 PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM DIAGNOSIS\n【16】 Blood tests — Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is diagnosed based upon levels of blood calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH). In most people with PHPT, both levels are higher than normal. Occasionally, a person may have an elevated calcium level and a normal or minimally elevated PTH level. Since PTH should be low when calcium is elevated, a normal or minimally elevated PTH is considered abnormal and usually indicates PHPT. Very rarely, this picture is seen in a person with a genetic condition called familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) in which the elevation in blood calcium is lifelong.\n【17】 Skeletal assessment: Bone density testing — Bone density testing is usually recommended for people with PHPT. This test can help determine if the bones have become weakened as a result of high PTH levels drawing calcium out of the skeleton. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) testing is the most commonly used method for measuring bone density. Bone density is usually lowest at the forearm in people with PHPT. This test is described in detail separately. (See  \"Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【18】 In addition, because of the possibility of asymptomatic vertebral (spine) fractures in people with PHPT, a plain X-ray of the spine or a vertebral fracture assessment of the DXA image to identify the presence of such fractures is sometimes recommended.\n【19】 Kidney assessment — Hypercalcemia may adversely affect kidney function. Measurement of 24-hour urinary calcium excretion (to assess risk of kidney stones) and serum creatinine (a test of kidney function) is routinely performed in people with asymptomatic PHPT in order to assess the risk of kidney complications (when urine calcium is high or kidney function is impaired) and thus determine subsequent management.\n【20】 In some people, an abdominal X-ray, an ultrasound, or computed tomography (CT) of the kidneys is obtained to detect silent kidney stones, which, if present, also determine subsequent treatment. (See  \"Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【21】 PRIMARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM TREATMENT\n【22】 Nonsurgical treatment — Nonsurgical treatment may be recommended for people who have no symptoms and whose blood calcium is only mildly elevated, provided they do not have low bone density, asymptomatic vertebral fractures, impaired renal function, or silent kidney stones. Blood calcium levels should be measured every six months, and tests of kidney function are recommended once per year. Bone density testing is usually recommended every one to two years, depending upon your situation. (See  \"Primary hyperparathyroidism: Management\".)\n【23】 General measures — People with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) who do not have symptoms are advised to:\n【24】 Treating bone loss — Medications that inhibit bone breakdown may be prescribed if you have evidence of decreased bone density (osteoporosis). These medications can protect the bones from the bone thinning effects of excess PTH but will not normalize the calcium levels in the blood. The treatment of osteoporosis is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【25】 Surgical treatment — Surgery is the only way to cure PHPT, and it is recommended for people with symptoms. It is often also recommended for people with moderately elevated blood calcium levels, impaired kidney function, low bone density, high urine calcium levels, and silent kidney stones or fractures.\n【26】 Surgery is also recommended for people younger than 50 years old or if periodic follow-up would be difficult (eg, if a person lives far from a health care provider or often travels to places where it is difficult to find medical care).\n【27】 Surgery should be performed by an experienced endocrine surgeon.\n【28】 Traditional surgery — The surgery is usually done while the person is under anesthesia. An incision is made in the lower neck measuring 2.5 to 10 cm (1 to 5 inches). Usually, at least one abnormal-appearing gland is removed while the normal-appearing glands are left in place.\n【29】 Minimally invasive surgery — Several kinds of minimally invasive surgery can be performed in cases where one abnormal parathyroid gland has been located by a preoperative imaging study. This most frequently will be a nuclear medicine scan, or an ultrasound, depending on local hospital expertise.\n【30】 The surgery can be performed under local nerve block and is a good alternative for people who are at high risk for general anesthesia. During the surgery, a small incision (1 to 4 cm or 0.4 to 1.8 inches) is made in the neck and the abnormal tissue is removed. The blood level of PTH is tested before and immediately after removal to confirm that the PTH level drops significantly after the abnormal tissue is removed.\n【31】 The advantage of minimally invasive surgery compared with traditional surgery is that it requires a smaller incision and less time under anesthesia. This type of procedure is only available for people with certain characteristics, and it requires an experienced surgeon and medical center.\n【32】 Effectiveness of surgery — With an experienced endocrine surgeon, surgical treatment is effective in curing PHPT in approximately 95 percent of people. The complication rate associated with surgery is very low.\n【33】 Complications could include temporary or permanent damage to the other parathyroid glands, resulting in low calcium levels, bleeding, and/or temporary or permanent hoarseness. In some centers, parathyroid surgery is a day procedure and does not require overnight hospitalization. In other centers, the person is hospitalized for a short time after surgery, usually for one day.\n【34】 Occasionally, some abnormal parathyroid tissue goes undetected and is not removed during the first operation. In this case, high calcium levels and symptoms of PHPT persist after surgery. Imaging studies are required to locate the abnormal parathyroid tissue. In some people, parathyroid glands may be present in unusual locations, such as in the chest or in other regions of the neck. A second surgical procedure is usually required to remove remaining abnormal tissue. If another operation is needed, it is best to have two imaging tests to locate the diseased gland(s).\n【35】 Follow-up care after surgery — In the initial period after surgery, it is important to have adequate calcium intake, and many physicians recommend using calcium supplements. Six to eight weeks after surgery, most clinicians recommend a blood test to measure the blood level of calcium and PTH. These tests are then repeated six months after surgery and then once per year to ensure that they remain normal and that abnormal tissue has not regrown. A bone density test may be recommended one year after surgery to guide treatment of bone loss. (See 'Skeletal assessment: Bone density testing' above and 'Treating bone loss' above.)\n【36】 WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION — Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.\n【37】 This article will be updated as needed on our website (www-uptodate-com.webvpn.cams.cn/patients).

Some of the most relevant are listed below.\n【38】 Patient level information — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials.\n【39】 The Basics — The Basics patient education pieces answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.\n【40】 Beyond the Basics — Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed.

It occurs in approximately 1 out of every 1000 babies born alive, and it is caused by a genetic abnormality that affects something called a chromosome.\n【2】 Chromosomes are large structures found in cells that house thousands of genes. People without genetic abnormalities have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each pair is given a number between 1 and 23.\n【3】 People with Down syndrome are born with three, rather than two, copies of chromosome 21. Scientists do not know why some babies wind up with the extra chromosome, but they do know that the age of the mother plays a role. As a female gets older, the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome steadily increases. The age of the male parent may also be relevant, but scientists do not yet know that definitively.\n【4】 This topic will discuss what to expect if your baby has been diagnosed with Down syndrome. Information about how Down syndrome is diagnosed during pregnancy is discussed separately. (See  \"Patient education: Should I have a screening test for Down syndrome during pregnancy? (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【5】 If your baby has Down syndrome, you may not be able to tell immediately after birth that anything is different. Even so, most babies with Down syndrome have at least some physical characteristics that distinguish them from babies with a normal chromosomal complement:\n【6】 Aside from its effects on appearance, Down syndrome can cause a number of medical complications. Some of these complications are more serious than others, but most of them can be treated. To make sure that complications are appropriately managed as they emerge, have your child screened at regular intervals (table 1).\n【7】 Potentially serious complications — The most serious complications of Down syndrome include heart defects, blood disorders that can include leukemia (cancer of the blood), and immune system problems.\n【8】 Heart defects — Approximately half of all babies with Down syndrome are born with (often repairable) heart defects. Usually, these defects affect the walls separating the four chambers of the heart.\n【9】 Blood disorders — Down syndrome can cause blood cell abnormalities, including a form of blood cancer called leukemia.\n【10】 Immune system problems — The immune system of people with Down syndrome may not work as it should. As a result, people with Down syndrome are more vulnerable than others to infections, certain kinds of cancer, and autoimmune conditions.\n【11】 Stomach and digestive system — Approximately 5 percent of babies with Down syndrome have abnormally formed digestive organs, which can block the gastrointestinal tract and may require surgery. They are also more prone to celiac disease, a condition that impairs their ability to absorb nutrients and that makes them unable to tolerate a protein in wheat called gluten. (See  \"Patient education: Celiac disease in children (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【12】 Hormonal disorders — Down syndrome can affect the way the body produces or responds to hormones. For example, people with Down syndrome often do not make sufficient thyroid hormone, which can contribute to problems with weight. They are also at risk for type 1 diabetes, which requires treatment with insulin injections.\n【13】 Skeletal problems — People with Down syndrome often have too much flexibility between the bones at the top of the spine that support the head (called atlantoaxial instability). Often, this condition causes no symptoms, but it can compress the spine, cause pain, or cause the head to tilt to one side. In extreme cases, this joint instability can cause paralysis.\n【14】 Children who participate in sports or other activities, such as the Special Olympics, should have a physical examination to look for signs of joint instability.\n【15】 Other complications — Less serious complications include those affecting vision and hearing and those that lead to other non-life-threatening conditions.\n【16】 Intellectual disability — Almost all babies born with Down syndrome are intellectually disabled, but the degree of impairment can vary a lot. Despite the disability, most children with Down syndrome can learn basic tasks; they just take a little longer than other babies to do so. The table lists the average ages at which babies with Down syndrome reach certain milestones (table 2).\n【17】 Height and weight — Babies with Down syndrome are usually smaller than other babies, and they have smaller heads. They may also grow more slowly and may never reach the same heights that typical children do.\n【18】 Although children with Down syndrome grow less than usual, they tend to gain more weight, possibly from a slower metabolism. As a result, parents need to guard against obesity by encouraging exercise and, if necessary, limiting the amount of food the child eats.\n【19】 Vision — Most children with Down syndrome have some sort of vision problem, such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism (an abnormal curvature of the eye that causes blurred vision). They may also have weak eye muscles (cross-eyed) or have abnormal eye movements that impair vision. Glasses can often correct these problems.\n【20】 Hearing loss — Nearly 80 percent of people with Down syndrome develop some degree of hearing impairment, sometimes requiring a hearing aid. Children with Down syndrome are also much more prone than other children to having ear infections. (See  \"Patient education: Ear infections (otitis media) in children (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【21】 Skin — The majority of children with Down syndrome have a skin disorder of one sort or another. These disorders are not usually cause for concern. Examples include:\n【22】 Behavior — Behavioral and psychological problems are more common among children with Down syndrome than among other children. Common disorders include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional disorder, and aggressive disorders. As many as 7 percent of children with Down syndrome have an autism spectrum disorder. (See  \"Patient education: Symptoms and diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children (Beyond the Basics)\" and  \"Patient education: Autism spectrum disorder (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【23】 Sleep apnea — Up to 75 percent of children with Down syndrome have sleep apnea, a sleep disorder that causes them to intermittently stop breathing while asleep. The condition is often tied to being overweight, but, among children with Down syndrome, it happens even when weight is not an issue. (See  \"Management of obstructive sleep apnea in children\".)\n【24】 Fertility — Females with Down syndrome are usually fertile and may become pregnant. If you have a daughter, it is important to educate her about sex and how to take precautions against unwanted pregnancy. Nearly all males with Down syndrome are infertile. Still, if you have a son, it is important to educate him about appropriate behavior when it comes to sex.\n【25】 Down syndrome is usually diagnosed during pregnancy. If Down syndrome is not diagnosed during pregnancy, health care providers can usually diagnose Down syndrome based on the infant's appearance. In such cases, the diagnosis should be confirmed using a blood test that examines the child's chromosomes (karyotype).\n【26】 A thorough discussion of prenatal Down syndrome diagnosis is available separately. (See  \"Patient education: Should I have a screening test for Down syndrome during pregnancy? (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【27】 There is no treatment specifically for Down syndrome, but there are several important treatments for the complications of the condition. That is why it is important to have children screened for these complications at regular intervals throughout their youth (table 1).\n【28】 Having children routinely screened can help ensure that they will get the appropriate treatment as soon as any Down syndrome-related complications arise. That can be important for serious complications as well as for not-so-serious ones. For example, children may need corrective surgery to treat a heart defect. Or, children may need eyeglasses or hearing aids, not only to improve vision or hearing, but also to maximize their ability to learn and understand.\n【29】 The prognosis for a child with Down syndrome used to be pretty grim. In 1983, the average lifespan of a person with the condition was just 25 years. Thanks to advances in the treatment and screening of people with Down syndrome, the average lifespan is approximately 60 years.\n【30】 As medicine continues to evolve, the outlook for people with Down syndrome will probably keep improving. Even now, many children with the condition go on to have full and happy lives, so long as they have the right support.\n【31】 Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.\n【32】 This article will be updated as needed on our website (www.uptodate.com/patients).

These reactions generally occur and resolve in the first week post-treatment. Risk may be increased in patients with higher microfilarial burden. Treatment of severe Mazzoti reactions is not definitive, but includes supportive care (eg, hydration and/or parenteral corticosteroids) to treat postural hypotension. Antihistamines and/or aspirin have been used for most mild to moderate reactions.\n【50】 • Orthostatic hypotension: Orthostatic hypotension may occur, most commonly on the first 1 to 2 days after treatment. Decrease in blood pressure was transient and managed by resuming recumbency.\n【51】 _**Disease-related concerns:**_\n【52】 • Loiasis: Pretreatment assessment for loiasis is recommended in any patient with exposure to _Loa loa_\\-endemic areas; serious, sometimes fatal, encephalopathy may occur following treatment with moxidectin in onchocerciasis patients with concomitant loiasis.\n【53】 _**Other warnings/precautions:**_\n【54】 • Hyperreactive onchodermatitis: Patients with hyperreactive dermatitis (sowda) may be at increased risk for severe edema and worsening of onchodermatitis following treatment with moxidectin.\n【55】 Product Availability\n【56】 There are no plans for commercial distribution of moxidectin in the US. Product will be available for onchocerciasis endemic parts of the world.\n【57】 Dosage Forms: US\n【58】 Tablet, oral\n【59】 Generic: 2 mg \\[500s\\] \\[contains lactose, sodium lauryl sulfate\\]\n【60】 Administration: Pediatric\n【61】 Oral: May be taken without regard to food\n【62】 Administration: Adult\n【63】 **Oral:** Administer without regard to meals.\n【64】 Storage/Stability\n【65】 Store below 30°C (86°F). Protect from light. Once opened, administer within 24 hours. Discard unused tablets.\n【66】 Use\n【67】 Treatment of onchocerciasis due to _Onchocerca volvulus_ (FDA approved in ages ≥12 years and adults). **Note:** Moxidectin tablets do not kill adult _O. volvulus_.\n【68】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【69】 None known.\n【70】 Drug Interactions  \n【71】   \n【72】 (For additional information: Launch drug interactions program)\n【73】 There are no known significant interactions.\n【74】 Reproductive Considerations\n【75】 Patients who could become pregnant were required to use long-acting contraception during clinical studies (Awadzi 2014; Korth-Bradley 2011), likely due to the long terminal half-life of moxidectin.\n【76】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【77】 Adverse events were observed in some animal reproduction studies.\n【78】 Monitoring Parameters\n【79】 Skin microfilarial counts; screening for loiasis prior to treatment in patients exposed to _Loa loa_\\-endemic areas; signs and symptoms of Mazzotti reaction, including symptomatic orthostatic hypotension\n【80】 Mechanism of Action\n【81】 Moxidectin, an anthelminthic agent, is active against the microfilariae of _O. volvulus_, but not effective in killing the adult worms. Studies with other nematodes suggest moxidectin binds to glutamate-gated chloride ions channels, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors, and/or APT-binding cassette transporters. This leads to increased permeability, influx of chloride ions, hyperpolarization, and muscle paralysis. There is also a reduction in motility of all stages of the parasite, excretion of immunomodulatory proteins, and the fertility of both male and female adult worms.\n【82】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【83】 Distribution: V<sub>d</sub>: 2,421 ± 1,658 L\n【84】 Protein binding: Unknown\n【85】 Metabolism: Minimal\n【86】 Half-life elimination: 23.3 days (559 hours)\n【87】 Time to peak: 4 hours\n【88】 Excretion: Feces: 2% (as unchanged drug)", "title": "Moxidectin (United States  Not available)  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/moxidectin-united-states-not-available-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E5%85%A8%E8%BA%AB%E8%BF%87%E6%95%8F%E5%8F%8D%E5%BA%94&source=search_result&selectedTitle=119%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis.\n【40】 • Contact dermatitis: Allergic contact dermatitis can occur and it is usually diagnosed by failure to heal rather than clinical exacerbation.\n【41】 • Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection; discontinue if dermatological infection persists despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy.\n【42】 • Kaposi sarcoma: Prolonged treatment with corticosteroids has been associated with the development of Kaposi sarcoma (case reports); if noted, discontinuation of therapy should be considered (Goedert, 2002).\n【43】 • Systemic effects: Topical corticosteroids may be absorbed percutaneously. Absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause manifestations of Cushing syndrome, hyperglycemia, or glycosuria. Absorption is increased by the use of occlusive dressings, application to denuded skin, or application to large surface areas.\n【44】 **_Disease-related concerns:_**\n【45】 • Diaper dermatitis: Do not use for diaper dermatitis.\n【46】 **_Special populations:_**\n【47】 • Pediatric: Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts after topical application and may be more prone to systemic effects. HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, and Cushing's syndrome have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Prolonged use may affect growth velocity; growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.\n【48】 **_Dosage form specific issues:_**\n【49】 • Petrolatum-based: Avoid contact with latex-containing products; may damage or reduce effectiveness of latex condoms or diaphragms. If contact occurs, throw away latex product. Do not use prednicarbate intravaginally.\n【50】 **_Other warnings/precautions:_**\n【51】 • Appropriate use: For topical use only; do not use intravaginally. Avoid contact with eyes, face, underarms, or groin area. Do not use occlusive dressings; discontinue use if irritation occurs.\n【52】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【53】 The extent of percutaneous absorption is dependent on several factors, including epidermal integrity (intact vs abraded skin), formulation, age of the patient, prolonged duration of use, and the use of occlusive dressings. Percutaneous absorption of topical steroids is increased in neonates (especially preterm neonates), infants, and young children. Infants and small children may be more susceptible to HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, Cushing syndrome, or other systemic toxicities due to larger skin surface area to body mass ratio.\n【54】 Dosage Forms: US\n【55】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling. \\[DSC\\] = Discontinued product\n【56】 Cream, External:\n【57】 Generic: 0.1% (60 g \\[DSC\\])\n【58】 Ointment, External:\n【59】 Generic: 0.1% (15 g \\[DSC\\], 60 g \\[DSC\\])\n【60】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【61】 Yes\n【62】 Pricing: US\n【63】 **Ointment** (Prednicarbate External)\n【64】 0.1% (per gram): $2.00\n【65】 **Disclaimer:** A representative AWP (Average Wholesale Price) price or price range is provided as reference price only.

For a complete list of drug interactions by individual drug name and detailed management recommendations, use the Lexicomp drug interactions program by clicking on the “Launch drug interactions program” link above.\n【93】 Aldesleukin: Corticosteroids may diminish the antineoplastic effect of Aldesleukin. _Risk X: Avoid combination_\n【94】 Reproductive Considerations\n【95】 Topical corticosteroids may be used for the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive dermatosis, such as atopic dermatitis, in patients planning a pregnancy (Vestergaard 2019).\n【96】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【97】 Systemic bioavailability of topical corticosteroids is variable (integrity of skin, use of occlusion, etc) and may be further influenced by trimester of pregnancy (Chi 2017). In general, the use of topical corticosteroids is not associated with a significant risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes; however, there may be an increased risk of low-birth-weight infants following maternal use of potent or very potent topical products, especially in high doses, although this risk is likely to be low (Andersson 2021; Chi 2015; Chi 2017).\n【98】 When first-line treatments, such as emollients, are insufficient, topical corticosteroids may be used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in pregnant patients (Vestergaard 2019). Topical corticosteroids are classified by potency; the medication and formulation (eg, cream, gel, salt form) contribute to the potency classification (Oakley 2021; Stacey 2021; Tadicherla 2009). In general, use of the least potent product in limited amounts is recommended during pregnancy. Mild to moderate potency corticosteroids are preferred; potent to very potent topical corticosteroids should only be used as alternative therapy in limited amounts under obstetrical care. Pregnant patients should avoid application of topical corticosteroids to areas with high percutaneous absorption (eg, armpit, skin folds, vulva) (Chi 2017), and caution should be used when applying to areas prone to striae formation (eg, abdomen, breast, thighs) (Vestergaard 2019).\n【99】 Monitoring Parameters\n【100】 Growth in pediatric patients; hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression (eg, ACTH stimulation test, morning plasma cortisol test, urinary free cortisol test); signs and symptoms of intracranial hypertension (bulging fontanelles, headaches, bilateral papilledema).\n【101】 Mechanism of Action\n【102】 Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. May depress the formation, release, and activity of endogenous chemical mediators of inflammation (kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins) through the induction of phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> inhibitory proteins (lipocortins) and sequential inhibition of the release of arachidonic acid. Prednicarbate has intermediate range potency.\n【103】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【104】 Absorption: Topical corticosteroids are absorbed percutaneously. The extent is dependent on several factors, including epidermal integrity (intact vs abraded skin), formulation, age of the patient, and the use of occlusive dressings.

Avoid use in patients showing the premonitory signs of hepatic coma.\n【75】 • Hyperthyroidism: Use with caution in patients with hyperthyroidism.\n【76】 • Hypoadrenalism: Use with caution in patients with hypoadrenalism.\n【77】 • Porphyria: Sezaby: May precipitate life-threatening, acute attacks of porphyria in patients with acute porphyria; symptoms may include abdominal pain, anxiety, confusion, hyponatremia, limb pain, muscle weakness, and seizures.\n【78】 • Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment.\n【79】 • Substance use disorder: Use with caution in patients with a history of substance use disorder; potential for drug dependency exists. Tolerance, psychological and physical dependence may occur with prolonged use.\n【80】 • Debilitated patients: Use with caution in patients who are debilitated.\n【81】 • Fever: Use with caution in patients with a fever.\n【82】 • Pediatric: May cause paradoxical responses, including agitation and hyperactivity. Phenobarbital has been associated with cognitive deficits in children receiving therapy for complicated febrile seizures.\n【83】 • Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension and cardiovascular collapse (AAP 1997; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol with caution in neonates See manufacturer's labeling.\n【84】 • Injection: Avoid perivascular extravasation or intra-arterial injection due to highly alkaline nature. Discontinue use with signs of discoloration, pain, swelling, or temperature change in the limb. Too rapid administration may cause severe respiratory depression, apnea, laryngospasm, hypertension or vasodilation with fall in blood pressure. Phenobarbital IV may require ≥15 minutes before reaching peak concentrations in the brain; injecting phenobarbital until the convulsions stop may lead to severe barbiturate induced depression.\n【85】 • Propylene glycol: Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; large amounts are potentially toxic and have been associated hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Zar 2007).\n【86】 • Acute pain: Use with caution in patients with acute or chronic pain; paradoxical excitement could be induced or important symptoms could be masked.\n【87】 • Withdrawal: Antiseizure medications should not be discontinued abruptly because of the possibility of increasing seizure frequency; therapy should be withdrawn gradually to minimize the potential of increased seizure frequency, unless safety concerns require a more rapid withdrawal.\n【88】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【89】 Rapid IV administration may cause respiratory depression, apnea, laryngospasm, or hypotension; use with caution in hemodynamically unstable patients (hypotension or shock). Phenobarbital may cause CNS depression and effects with other sedative drugs may be potentiated; when treating status epilepticus, additional respiratory support may be required particularly when maximizing loading dose or if concurrent sedative therapy (AAP [Shenoi 2020]).\n【90】 Cognitive deficits observed with phenobarbital were further described in a retrospective chart review of 280 pediatric patients who had received either phenobarbital, levetiracetam, or both for treatment of neonatal seizures. A subset of the study group (n=67) had a Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) completed at 24 months corrected age. Based on the analysis of cumulative exposures, the investigators observed that increased phenobarbital exposure was associated with a significant decrease in BSID cognitive (8 points) and motor (9 points) scores and an increased probability for the development of cerebral palsy (2.3-fold) for every 100 mg/kg of phenobarbital exposure (Maitre 2013).\n【91】 Pediatric patients may be at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency; with chronic therapy, phenobarbital may cause catabolism of vitamin D; the daily vitamin D requirement may be increased in these patients (≥400 units/day); vitamin D status should be periodically monitored with laboratory data (Misra 2008; Wagner 2008). A retrospective study demonstrated that enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) increased systemic clearance of antileukemic drugs (teniposide and methotrexate) and were associated with a worse event-free survival, CNS relapse, and hematologic relapse (ie, lower efficacy), in B-lineage ALL children receiving chemotherapy; the authors recommend using nonenzyme-inducing AEDs in patients receiving chemotherapy for ALL (Relling 2000).\n【92】 Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; in neonates, large amounts of propylene glycol delivered orally, intravenously (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically have been associated with potentially fatal toxicities which can include metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, and CNS depression; toxicities have also been reported in children and adults including hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Shehab 2009).\n【93】 Phenobarbital elixir and oral solutions contain 15% alcohol.\n【94】 Dosage Forms: US\n【95】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【96】 Elixir, Oral:\n【97】 Generic: 20 mg/5 mL (5 mL, 7.5 mL, 15 mL, 473 mL)\n【98】 Solution, Injection, as sodium:\n【99】 Generic: 65 mg/mL (1 mL); 130 mg/mL (1 mL)\n【100】 Solution Reconstituted, Intravenous, as sodium [preservative free]:\n【101】 Sezaby: 100 mg (1 ea)\n【102】 Tablet, Oral:\n【103】 Generic: 15 mg, 16.2 mg, 30 mg, 32.4 mg, 60 mg, 64.8 mg, 97.2 mg, 100 mg\n【104】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【105】 May be product dependent\n【106】 Pricing: US\n【107】 20 mg/5 mL (per mL): $0.19 - $0.20\n【108】 65 mg/mL (per mL): $21.60 - $31.62\n【109】 130 mg/mL (per mL): $43.20 - $82.08\n【110】 100 mg (per each): $160.06\n【111】 15 mg (per each): $0.17 - $0.30\n【112】 16.2 mg (per each): $0.12 - $0.53\n【113】 30 mg (per each): $0.11 - $0.42\n【114】 32.4 mg (per each): $0.17 - $0.68\n【115】 60 mg (per each): $0.53\n【116】 64.8 mg (per each): $0.19 - $0.84\n【117】 97.2 mg (per each): $0.25 - $1.19\n【118】 100 mg (per each): $0.74\n【119】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【120】 Generic: 25 mg/5 mL (100 mL)\n【121】 Solution, Injection:\n【122】 Generic: 30 mg/mL (1 mL); 120 mg/mL (1 mL)\n【123】 Generic: 15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, 100 mg\n【124】 Extemporaneous Preparations\n【125】 An alcohol-free 10 mg/mL phenobarbital oral suspension may be made from tablets and one of two different vehicles (a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Plus and Ora-Sweet or a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Plus and Ora-Sweet SF).

SUBQ administration is not recommended. Avoid extravasation. Avoid small veins, such as those on the dorsum of the hand or wrist, and avoid varicose veins. Preference is given to larger veins. Inject slow IV; the maximum rate recommended by the manufacturer for adults is 60 mg/minute. In the setting of status epilepticus, the Neurocritical Care Society recommends administration at a rate of 50 to 100 mg/minute (Ref). Administration over 15 to 30 minutes has been recommended in neonates (Ref); large loading doses (eg, 40 mg/kg) in neonates have been infused over 60 minutes (Ref). Too rapid administration may result in severe respiratory depression, apnea, laryngospasm, hypertension, or vasodilation with fall in blood pressure. Discontinue administration of injection if there is any evidence of pain, swelling, discoloration, or temperature change in the limb.\n【132】 Administration: Adult\n【133】 May be administered IV, IM, or orally.\n【134】 According to the manufacturer, rapid IV administration >60 mg/minute should be avoided.

PHENobarbital may decrease the serum concentration of Zonisamide. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【620】 Zopiclone: PHENobarbital may enhance the CNS depressant effect of Zopiclone. PHENobarbital may decrease the serum concentration of Zopiclone.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【621】 Zuclopenthixol: CYP3A4 Inducers (Strong) may decrease the serum concentration of Zuclopenthixol.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【622】 Zuranolone: CYP3A4 Inducers (Strong) may decrease the serum concentration of Zuranolone.  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【623】 Food Interactions\n【624】 Phenobarbital increases the hepatic metabolism of vitamin D to inactive compounds and reduces calcium absorption (Gough 1986).  Management: Increase intake of foods rich in vitamin D. Supplementation of vitamin D and/or calcium may be necessary.\n【625】 Dietary Considerations\n【626】 Folate and vitamin B: Phenobarbital use has been associated with low serum concentrations of folate, vitamin B2 (riboflavin), B6 (pyridoxine) and B12 (cyanocobalamin), which may contribute to hyperhomocysteinemia. Hyperhomocysteinemia may contribute to cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolic disease, dementia, neuropsychiatric symptoms and poor seizure control. Some clinicians recommend administering folic acid, riboflavin, pyridoxine and cyanocobalamin supplements in patients taking phenobarbital (Apeland 2003; Apeland 2008; Belcastro 2012; Bochyńska 2012).\n【627】 Vitamin D and calcium: Phenobarbital increases the hepatic metabolism of vitamin D to inactive compounds and reduces calcium absorption (Gough 1986); increase intake of foods rich in vitamin D. Supplementation of vitamin D and/or calcium may be necessary.\n【628】 Injection may contain sodium.\n【629】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【630】 Phenobarbital crosses the placenta (Harden 2009b). Barbiturates can be detected in the placenta, fetal liver, and fetal brain. Fetal and maternal blood concentrations may be similar following parenteral administration. An increased incidence of fetal abnormalities may occur following maternal use. When used during the third trimester of pregnancy, withdrawal symptoms may occur in the neonate, including seizures and hyperirritability; symptoms of withdrawal may be delayed in the neonate up to 14 days after birth. Use during labor does not impair uterine activity; however, respiratory depression may occur in the newborn; resuscitation equipment should be available, especially for premature infants. Use for the treatment of epilepsy should be avoided during pregnancy (Harden 2009a).\n【631】 A registry is available for women exposed to phenobarbital during pregnancy: Pregnant women may enroll themselves into the North American Antiepileptic Drug (AED) Pregnancy Registry (888-233-2334 or http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org).\n【632】 Monitoring Parameters\n【633】 Phenobarbital serum concentrations (as clinically indicated); CNS status, seizure activity, liver enzymes (periodic with prolonged therapy), CBC with differential (periodic with prolonged therapy), renal function (periodic with prolonged therapy), vitamin D levels with prolonged use (Wagner 2008); signs and symptoms of suicidality (eg, anxiety, depression, behavior changes).\n【634】 IV use: Respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, IV site (stop injection if any evidence of pain, swelling, discoloration, or temperature change in the limb).\n【635】 Hyperbilirubinemia treatment: Monitor bilirubin (total and direct).\n【636】 Reference Range\n【637】 Timing of serum samples: Draw trough just before next dose (Hiemke 2018).\n【638】 Therapeutic reference range: A clear correlation between serum phenobarbital concentrations and therapeutic response has not been demonstrated; however, a range of 10 to 40 mcg/mL (SI: 43 to 172 micromole/L) has been reported (Patsalos 2008; Patsalos 2018).\n【639】 Mechanism of Action\n【640】 Long-acting barbiturate with sedative, hypnotic, and antiseizure properties. Barbiturates depress the sensory cortex, decrease motor activity, alter cerebellar function, and produce drowsiness, sedation, and hypnosis. In high doses, barbiturates exhibit antiseizure activity; barbiturates produce dose-dependent respiratory depression.\n【641】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【642】 Onset of action: Oral: ≥60 minutes; IV: 5 minutes.\n【643】 Peak effect: IV: CNS depression: ≥15 minutes.\n【644】 Duration: Oral: 10 to 12 hours; IV: >6 hours.\n【645】 Absorption: Oral: Adults: Rapid and complete; Newborns: Delayed and incomplete (Patsalos 2008).\n【646】 Distribution: Vd:\n【647】 Neonates: 0.85 ± 0.059 L/kg (Heimann 1977).\n【648】 2 to 3 months: 0.857 ± 0.089 L/kg (Heimann 1977).\n【649】 4 to 12 months: 0.57 ± 0.046 L/kg (Heimann 1977).\n【650】 1 to 5 years: 0.666 ± 0.073 L/kg (Heimann 1977).\n【651】 Adults: 0.61 L/kg (Patsalos 2018).\n【652】 Protein binding:\n【653】 Neonates and young infants: 36% to 43% (Patsalos 2008).\n【654】 Adults: 48% (Patsalos 2018).\n【655】 Metabolism: Hepatic by oxidation via CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent via CYP2C19 and CYP2E1, and by N-glucosidation (Patsalos 2018).\n【656】 Bioavailability: Oral:\n【657】 Neonates and young infants: ~48.9 (Marsot 2014).\n【658】 Adults: 90% (Patsalos 2018).\n【659】 Half-life elimination:\n【660】 ≤10 days of life: 114.2 ± 43 hours (Alonso Gonzalez 1993; Patsalos 2008).\n【661】 11 to 30 days of life: 73.19 ± 24.17 hours (Alonso Gonzalez 1993; Patsalos 2008).\n【662】 2 to 3 months: 62.9 ± 5.2 hours (Heimann 1977).\n【663】 4 to 12 months: 63.2 ± 4.2 hours (Heimann 1977).\n【664】 1 to 5 years: 68.5 ± 3.2 hours (Heimann 1977).\n【665】 Adults: ~79 hours (range: 53 to 118 hours).\n【666】 Time to peak, serum: Oral:\n【667】 Newborns: 1.5 to 6 hours (Patsalos 2008).\n【668】 Adults: 2 to 4 hours (Patsalos 2018).\n【669】 Excretion: Urine (25% to 50% as unchanged drug); feces (minimal).\n【670】 Brand Names: International\n【671】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Phenobarbital  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E9%85%92%E7%B2%BE%E6%88%92%E6%96%AD%E4%BC%B4%E6%8A%BD%E6%90%90&source=search_result&selectedTitle=75%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

Incidence rates are reported for monotherapy use.\n【35】 >10%:\n【36】 Gastrointestinal: Diarrhea (extended release: 4% to 11%; immediate release: 1% to 2%), nausea (8% to 11%)\n【37】 Immunologic: Antibody development (antibody titers commonly decrease with continued use, though a small percentage of patients had increased titers; an attenuated glycemic response may be seen with antibody formation)\n【38】 Local: Injection-site reaction (including abscess at injection site, bruising at injection site, cellulitis at injection site, erythema at injection site, hematoma at injection site, injection-site nodule, injection-site pruritus, tissue necrosis at injection site)\n【39】 1% to 10%:\n【40】 Endocrine & metabolic: Hypoglycemia (2% to 5%, including severe hypoglycemia)\n【41】 Gastrointestinal: Constipation (2% to 9%), decreased appetite (immediate release: 1% to 2%), dyspepsia (3% to 7%), gallbladder disease (≤2%; including cholecystitis or cholelithiasis), vomiting (3% to 4%)\n【42】 Nervous system: Dizziness (1% to 3%), headache (4% to 8%)\n【43】 Postmarketing:\n【44】 Cardiovascular: Increased heart rate (Robinson 2013), prolongation P-R interval on ECG (Linnebjerg 2011)\n【45】 Dermatologic: Alopecia, macular eruption, papular rash, pruritus, urticaria\n【46】 Gastrointestinal: Abdominal distention, abdominal pain, acute pancreatitis, dysgeusia, eructation, flatulence, hemorrhagic pancreatitis, intestinal obstruction, necrotizing pancreatitis\n【47】 Hematologic & oncologic: Immune thrombocytopenia\n【48】 Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, angioedema, severe hypersensitivity reaction\n【49】 Nervous system: Drowsiness\n【50】 Renal: Acute kidney injury, exacerbation of renal failure, increased serum creatinine, kidney transplant dysfunction, renal insufficiency\n【51】 Contraindications\n【52】 Prior serious hypersensitivity to exenatide or any component of the formulation; history of or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (exenatide ER only); patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (exenatide ER only); history of drug-induced immune-mediated thrombocytopenia.\n【53】 Bydureon: End-stage renal disease (ESRD) or severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/minute) including dialysis patients.\n【54】 Byetta: Diabetic ketoacidosis, diabetic coma/precoma or type 1 diabetes mellitus; ESRD or severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/minute) including dialysis patients.\n【55】 Warnings/Precautions\n【56】 • Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, angioedema) have been reported; discontinue therapy in the event of a hypersensitivity reaction. Serious injection-site reactions (eg, abscess, cellulitis, necrosis), with or without subcutaneous nodules have been reported with use. Isolated cases required surgical intervention.\n【57】 • Gallbladder disease: Cases of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis have been reported; gallbladder studies and further clinical assessment are indicated if cholelithiasis is suspected.\n【58】 • GI symptoms: Most common reactions are GI related; these symptoms may be dose-related and may decrease in frequency/severity with gradual titration and continued use.\n【59】 • Pancreatitis: Cases of acute pancreatitis (including hemorrhagic and necrotizing with some fatalities) have been reported; monitor for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis (eg, persistent severe abdominal pain that may radiate to the back, and that may or may not be accompanied by vomiting). Prior to initiating therapy, consider other factors associated with pancreatitis that may be present (eg, hypertriglyceridemia, ethanol abuse, cholelithiasis); it is unknown if exenatide increases the risk for pancreatitis in these patients. If pancreatitis is suspected, discontinue use. Do not resume unless an alternative etiology of pancreatitis is confirmed. Consider alternative antidiabetic therapy in patients with a history of pancreatitis.\n【60】 • Renal effects: Cases of acute renal failure and chronic renal failure exacerbation, including severe cases requiring hemodialysis or kidney transplantation, have been reported. May cause nausea/vomiting/diarrhea with transient hypovolemia that can worsen renal function. Renal dysfunction was usually reversible with appropriate corrective measures, including discontinuation of exenatide. Risk may be increased in patients receiving concomitant medications affecting renal function and/or hydration status.\n【61】 • Thrombocytopenia: Serious bleeding (may be fatal) from drug-induced immune-mediated thrombocytopenia has been reported. Discontinue use and do not reinitiate therapy if drug-induced thrombocytopenia is suspected; thrombocytopenia may persist for ~10 weeks after discontinuation of therapy.\n【62】 • Thyroid tumors: Bydureon: [US Boxed Warning] Thyroid C-cell tumors have developed in animal studies with exenatide ER; it is not known if exenatide ER causes thyroid C-cell tumor, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in humans. Patients should be counseled on the potential risk of MTC with the use of exenatide and informed of symptoms of thyroid tumors (eg, neck mass, dysphagia, dyspnea, persistent hoarseness). Use of exenatide ER is contraindicated in patients with a personal or a family history of medullary thyroid cancer and in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN2). Consultation with an endocrinologist is recommended in patients who develop elevated calcitonin concentrations or have thyroid nodules detected during imaging studies or physical exam; routine monitoring of serum calcitonin or using thyroid ultrasound for early detection of MTC is of unknown value. Cases of MTC in humans have been reported with the GLP-1 agonist, liraglutide.\n【63】 • Bariatric surgery:\n【64】 - Dehydration: Evaluate, correct, and maintain postsurgical fluid requirements and volume status prior to initiating therapy, and closely monitor the patient for the duration of therapy; acute and chronic kidney failure exacerbation may occur. A majority of cases occurred in patients with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and/or dehydration. Nausea is common and fluid intake may be more difficult after gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and gastric band (Mechanick 2020).\n【65】 - Excessive glucagon-like peptide-1 exposure: Closely monitor for efficacy and assess for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis if therapy is initiated after surgery; gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy (but not gastric band) significantly increase endogenous postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentrations (Korner 2009; Peterli 2012). Administration of exogenous GLP-1 agonists may be redundant to surgery effects.\n【66】 • GI disease: Not recommended to be used in patients with gastroparesis or severe GI disease due to frequent GI adverse effects associated with use.\n【67】 • Renal impairment: Use is not recommended in patients with a CrCl <30 mL/minute (exenatide) or <45 mL/minute (exenatide ER) or end-stage renal disease (ESRD). If used in renal transplant recipients, monitor for hypovolemia.\n【68】 • Injection-site reactions: Bydureon: Serious injection-site reactions (eg, abscess, cellulitis, necrosis), with or without subcutaneous nodules, have been reported.\n【69】 • Multiple dose injection pens: According to the CDC, pen-shaped injection devices should never be used for more than one person (even when the needle is changed) because of the risk of infection. The injection device should be clearly labeled with individual patient information to ensure that the correct pen is used (CDC 2012).\n【70】 • Appropriate use: Not for use in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus or diabetic ketoacidosis.\n【71】 • Duplicate therapy: Avoid concurrent use of extended-release (weekly) and immediate-release (daily) exenatide formulations.\n【72】 • Pediatric: Unlike the extended-release formulations (Bydureon, Bydureon BCise), the immediate-release formulation (Byetta) did not show efficacy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in pediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age in clinical trials.\n【73】 Dosage Forms Considerations\n【74】 Bydureon: Extended release formulation\n【75】 Byetta: Immediate release formulation\n【76】 Dosage Forms: US\n【77】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【146】 Reproductive Considerations\n【147】 Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are not recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus planning to become pregnant. Patients who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy. Transition to a preferred therapy should be initiated prior to conception and contraception should be continued until glycemic control is achieved (ADA 2021; Alexopoulos 2019; Egan 2020)\n【148】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【149】 Based on in vitro data, exenatide has a low potential to cross the placenta (Hiles 2003).\n【150】 Poorly controlled diabetes during pregnancy can be associated with an increased risk of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including diabetic ketoacidosis, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, preterm delivery, delivery complications, major malformations, stillbirth, and macrosomia. To prevent adverse outcomes, prior to conception and throughout pregnancy, maternal blood glucose and HbA1c should be kept as close to target goals as possible but without causing significant hypoglycemia (ADA 2021; Blumer 2013).\n【151】 Agents other than exenatide are currently recommended to treat diabetes mellitus in pregnancy (ADA 2021).\n【152】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【153】 It is not known if exenatide is present in breast milk.\n【154】 According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother.\n【155】 Monitoring Parameters\n【156】 Serum glucose; renal function; volume status; weight; triglycerides; signs/symptoms of pancreatitis; signs/symptoms of gallbladder disease.\n【157】 HbA1c: Monitor at least twice yearly in patients who have stable glycemic control and are meeting treatment goals; monitor quarterly in patients in whom treatment goals have not been met, or with therapy change. Note: In patients prone to glycemic variability (eg, patients with insulin deficiency), or in patients whose HbA1c is discordant with serum glucose levels or symptoms, consider evaluating HbA1c in combination with blood glucose levels and/or a glucose management indicator (ADA 2021; KDIGO 2020).\n【158】 Reference Range\n【159】 HbA1c: <7% (a more aggressive [<6.5%] or less aggressive [<8%] HbA1c goal may be targeted based on patient-specific characteristics).  Note: In patients using a continuous glucose monitoring system, a goal of time in range >70% with time below range <4% is recommended and is similar to a goal HbA1c <7%.\n【160】 Preprandial capillary blood glucose: 80 to 130 mg/dL (SI: 4.4 to 7.2 mmol/L) (more or less stringent goals may be appropriate based on patient-specific characteristics).\n【161】 Peak postprandial capillary blood glucose (~1 to 2 hours after a meal): <180 mg/dL (SI: <10 mmol/L) (more or less stringent goals may be appropriate based on patient-specific characteristics).\n【162】 HbA1c: <7% to7.5% (healthy); <8% to 8.5% (complex/intermediate health). Note: Individualization may be appropriate based on patient and caregiver preferences and/or presence of cognitive impairment. In patients with very complex or poor health (ie, limited remaining life expectancy), consider making therapy decisions based on avoidance of hypoglycemia and symptomatic hyperglycemia rather than HbA1c level.\n【163】 Preprandial capillary blood glucose: 80 to 130 mg/dL (SI: 4.4 to 7.2 mmol/L) (healthy); 90 to 150 mg/dL (SI: 5 to 8.3 mmol/L) (complex/intermediate health); 100 to 180 mg/dL (SI: 5.6 to 10 mmol/L) (very complex/poor health).\n【164】 Bedtime capillary blood glucose: 80 to 180 mg/dL (SI: 4.4 to 10 mmol/L) (healthy); 100 to 180 mg/dL (SI: 5.6 to 10 mmol/L) (complex/intermediate health); 110 to 200 mg/dL (SI: 6.1 to 11.1 mmol/L) (very complex/poor health).\n【165】 Level 1: 54 to 70 mg/dL (SI: 3 to 3.9 mmol/L); hypoglycemia alert value; initiate fast-acting carbohydrate (eg, glucose) treatment.\n【166】 Level 2: <54 mg/dL (SI: <3 mmol/L); threshold for neuroglycopenic symptoms; requires immediate action.\n【167】 Level 3: Hypoglycemia associated with a severe event characterized by altered mental and/or physical status requiring assistance.\n【168】 Mechanism of Action\n【169】 Exenatide is an analog of the hormone incretin (glucagon-like peptide 1 or GLP-1) which increases glucose-dependent insulin secretion, decreases inappropriate glucagon secretion, increases B-cell growth/replication, slows gastric emptying, and decreases food intake. Exenatide administration results in decreases in hemoglobin A1c by approximately 0.5% to 1% (immediate release) or 1.5% to 1.9% (extended release).\n【170】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【171】 Distribution: Vd: 28.3 L\n【172】 Metabolism: Minimal systemic metabolism; proteolytic degradation may occur following glomerular filtration\n【173】 Half-life elimination:\n【174】 Immediate release (daily) formulation: 2.4 hours\n【175】 Extended release (weekly) formulation: ~2 weeks\n【176】 Time to peak, plasma: SubQ:\n【177】 Immediate release (daily) formulation: 2.1 hours\n【178】 Extended release (weekly) formulation: Single dose: Initial period of release of surface-bound exenatide is followed by a gradual release from microspheres with peaks at week 2 and week 6 to 7 respectively; with once-weekly dosing steady state is achieved at 6 to 7 weeks (Bydureon) and 10 weeks (Bydureon BCise).\n【179】 Excretion: Urine (majority of dose)\n【180】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【181】 Altered kidney function: In patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, exposure to exenatide was increased compared with patients with normal renal function.\n【182】 Brand Names: International\n【183】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Exenatide  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/exenatide-drug-information?search=%E5%A6%8A%E5%A8%A0%E6%9C%9F%E5%8E%9F%E6%9C%89%E7%9A%842%E5%9E%8B%E7%B3%96%E5%B0%BF%E7%97%85&source=search_result&selectedTitle=96%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}
{"seq_id": 6585, "text": "url: http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/heavy-or-prolonged-menstrual-bleeding-menorrhagia-beyond-the-basics?search=%E5%9B%A0%E5%AD%90Xa%E6%8A%91%E5%88%B6%E7%89%A9%E5%BC%95%E8%B5%B7%E7%9A%84%E5%87%BA%E8%A1%80&source=search_result&selectedTitle=96%7E150&usage_type=default\n【0】 Patient education  Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) (Beyond the Basics)\n【1】 INTRODUCTION — Most menstrual cycles (periods) occur every 24 to 38 days (as measured from the first day of one period to the first day of the next); the average is every 28 days. In a normal menstrual cycle, a person loses an average of 2 to 3 tablespoons (35 to 40 milliliters) of blood over four to eight days. However, some people lose a lot more blood.\n【2】 If you lose more than 5 to 6 tablespoons (approximately 80 milliliters) of blood during your period, this is called heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (doctors also sometimes use the term \"menorrhagia\"). This can lead to a problem called anemia (low red blood cell count), which can cause fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms.\n【3】 Several treatments for heavy bleeding are available.\n【4】 CAUSES OF HEAVY OR PROLONGED MENSTRUAL BLEEDING — The most common causes of excessive menstrual bleeding are:\n【5】 These causes are discussed in the following sections.\n【6】 Anovulation — Anovulation occurs when your ovaries do not produce and release an egg (ovulate) once per month. This causes your menstrual period to be irregular or absent. Anovulation is common in adolescents soon after menstruation starts and in people who are near menopause (perimenopause). Most people with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) do not ovulate regularly. (See  \"Patient education: Absent or irregular periods (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【7】 Abnormal tissue in the uterus — Noncancerous growths in the uterus can cause heavy menstrual bleeding. The most common noncancerous growths are:\n【8】 Bleeding tendency — Certain bleeding conditions or medications can cause heavy menstrual bleeding. Examples include:\n【9】 SYMPTOMS OF HEAVY OR PROLONGED MENSTRUAL BLEEDING — People with heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding typically have one or more of the following:\n【10】 When to seek help — If you soak through two pads or tampons in one hour for two hours in a row, call your health care provider or go to the emergency department. Bleeding this heavily can be serious or even life threatening.\n【11】 DIAGNOSIS OF HEAVY OR PROLONGED MENSTRUAL BLEEDING — If you have heavy menstrual bleeding, your health care provider will want to perform a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. They might recommend other tests, based on what they find during the exam. These can include:\n【12】 MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR HEAVY OR PROLONGED MENSTRUAL BLEEDING — If you have heavy menstrual bleeding, the best treatment for you will depend on:\n【13】 Your health care provider will probably recommend treatment with one or more medicines first. If these treatments do not reduce bleeding enough, surgical treatment might be an option. (See 'Surgery for heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding' below.)\n【14】 Hormonal birth control — If you have heavy menstrual bleeding and do not want to get pregnant, hormonal birth control might be a good option. Options include the pill, skin patch, vaginal ring, shot, and hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). These treatments reduce bleeding during your menstrual period. Hormonal birth control can also reduce cramps and pain during your period. It might take three months for bleeding to improve after you start taking hormonal birth control.\n【15】 Some forms of hormonal birth control, including the pill, skin patch, and vaginal ring, are designed to be used for three weeks in a row, followed by one week off. During the fourth week, you will have bleeding.\n【16】 More information about hormonal birth control is available separately. (See  \"Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【17】 Some doctors and nurses advise people with heavy menstrual bleeding to take hormonal birth control continuously, without a break week. If you take this approach, you will not have a monthly period. This strategy is called \"continuous dosing.\"\n【18】 Several brands of birth control pills are packaged with three months of pills to make it easier to take the pill continuously (table 1). You can also take other types of hormonal birth control continuously. This is explained in detail separately. (See  \"Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)\", section on 'Continuous dosing'.)\n【19】 Progestin pills — Norethindrone acetate (brand name: Aygestin) or medroxyprogesterone acetate (brand name: Provera) pills are also an option. Progestin pills are sometimes recommended for people who do not ovulate regularly. They may be prescribed for use 5 to 14 days each month or continuously (every day).\n【20】 This treatment helps to make the lining of the uterus thinner, reducing or even eliminating bleeding.\n【21】 Hormonal intrauterine device — There are IUDs that slowly release a hormone, progestin, into the uterus. They do not contain estrogen. Two progestin-containing IUDs (brand names: Mirena, Liletta) can be used to both prevent pregnancy and reduce menstrual bleeding for up to eight years (figure 1). A health care provider places the IUD inside the uterus in the office. This might be a good choice if you do not want to become pregnant for at least the next six months.\n【22】 The most common side effect of the hormonal IUD is irregular bleeding; this is usually light bleeding or spotting. This usually improves after the first several months after IUD placement. In people who use a hormonal IUD specifically to treat heavy bleeding, expulsion rates (when the uterus pushes the IUD into an improper position or completely out of the uterus) are higher than in people who use it just for preventing pregnancy. (See  \"Patient education: Long-acting methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)\", section on 'Intrauterine device'.)\n【23】 Shot — Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (brand name: Depo-Provera) is a long-acting form of a progesterone-like hormone, called a progestin. It is a shot given once every three months. This treatment prevents pregnancy and can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding. You might choose the shot if you do not want to become pregnant for at least one year.\n【24】 The most common side effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate is bleeding and spotting, particularly during the first few months. Many people completely stop having bleeding after using this treatment for one year. More detailed information about medroxyprogesterone acetate is available separately. (See  \"Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)\", section on 'Injectable birth control'.)\n【25】 Antifibrinolytic medicines — Antifibrinolytic medicines, such as tranexamic acid (brand name: Cyklokapron), can help to slow menstrual bleeding quickly. These medicines work by helping the blood clotting system.\n【26】 The advantages of antifibrinolytic medicines over other medical treatments are that:\n【27】 Side effects can include headache and muscle cramps or pain. If you take hormonal birth control, you should not take antifibrinolytic medicines unless your health care provider approves; there is controversy regarding a possible increased risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart attack when taken together.\n【28】 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) — Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (brand name: Motrin and Advil), naproxen (brand name: Aleve), and mefenamic acid (brand name: Ponstel), can help reduce menstrual bleeding and menstrual cramps. You can buy some NSAIDs (including ibuprofen) without a prescription.\n【29】 NSAIDs are not expensive, have few side effects, and reduce pain and bleeding, and you need to take them only during your menstrual period. You can take NSAIDs in combination with any of the medical treatments discussed here. However, NSAIDs do not reduce bleeding as well other medical treatments.\n【30】 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists — GnRH agonists are a type of medicine that can be used to temporarily reduce menstrual bleeding. This treatment might be recommended for people who are waiting to have surgical treatment.\n【31】 These medicines work by \"turning off\" the ovaries, causing a temporary menopause. The medicines can be taken for up to six months. Side effects may include hot flashes and vaginal dryness (common symptoms of natural menopause). GnRH agonists are not usually recommended for longer than six months in a row due to the risk of weakened bones when used for long periods of time.\n【32】 In some cases, GnRH agonists are prescribed along with a combined (estrogen-progestin) birth control pill. This combination limits the side effects experienced with GnRH agonists alone, such as hot flashes and weakening of the bones, while also reducing heavy bleeding. When used together, these medications can be taken for up to two years.\n【33】 SURGERY FOR HEAVY OR PROLONGED MENSTRUAL BLEEDING — If you have growths in your uterus, such as polyps or fibroids, getting treatment to remove them can reduce or eliminate heavy bleeding.\n【34】 Fibroids can be treated by removing them (called myomectomy) or cutting off their blood supply (called uterine artery embolization). These procedures are discussed in detail in a separate article. (See  \"Patient education: Uterine fibroids (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【35】 Other surgical treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding include the following.\n【36】 Endometrial ablation — Endometrial ablation is a treatment that destroys or removes most of the lining of the uterus. This can reduce heavy menstrual bleeding or stop menstrual bleeding altogether. It is not a good option if you might want to get pregnant in the future and may not be appropriate if your abnormal bleeding is caused by anovulation. The cause of the bleeding should be identified before endometrial ablation is performed.\n【37】 The treatment can be done in the office or as a day surgery. After the treatment, you may have some cramping, vaginal discharge, and nausea. You may also have a pinkish vaginal discharge for two to three days afterward; this gradually becomes clear and watery and can last for 2 to 10 days. Most people can go back to work or school the following day. (See  \"Patient education: Care after gynecologic surgery (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【38】 Hysterectomy — Hysterectomy is a major surgery that removes the uterus. This is a permanent treatment that cures heavy menstrual bleeding. However, the surgery can have complications and may require up to six weeks for full recovery. Pregnancy is not possible after hysterectomy. More detailed information about hysterectomy is available separately. (See  \"Patient education: Abdominal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)\" and  \"Patient education: Vaginal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【39】 WHICH TREATMENT IS RIGHT FOR ME? — There are many treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding, and it can be hard to decide which one is right.\n【40】 Step one — In most cases, you should start with medication:\n【41】 Step two — If you have tried one or more medicines and you still have heavy menstrual bleeding, talk to your health care provider. A surgical treatment might be a good option in this case. (See 'Surgery for heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding' above.)\n【42】 WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION — Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.\n【43】 This article will be updated as needed on our website (www-uptodate-com.webvpn.cams.cn/patients). Related topics for patients, as well as selected articles written for health care professionals, are also available. Some of the most relevant are listed below.\n【44】 Patient level information — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials.\n【45】 The Basics — The Basics patient education pieces answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.\n【46】 Beyond the Basics — Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【47】 Professional level information — Professional level articles are designed to keep doctors and other health professionals up-to-date on the latest medical findings. These articles are thorough, long, and complex, and they contain multiple references to the research on which they are based. Professional level articles are best for people who are comfortable with a lot of medical terminology and who want to read the same materials their doctors are reading.\n【48】 The following organization also provides reliable health information.\n【49】 ACKNOWLEDGMENT — The UpToDate editorial staff acknowledges Howard Zacur, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.", "title": "Patient education  Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding (menorrhagia) (Beyond the Basics)", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/heavy-or-prolonged-menstrual-bleeding-menorrhagia-beyond-the-basics?search=%E5%9B%A0%E5%AD%90Xa%E6%8A%91%E5%88%B6%E7%89%A9%E5%BC%95%E8%B5%B7%E7%9A%84%E5%87%BA%E8%A1%80&source=search_result&selectedTitle=96%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

The overall one-year prevalence was 9.1 percent (95% CI 8.4-9.8 percent), and the point prevalence was 4 percent (95% CI 2.6-5.7 percent). All pooled prevalences were higher among females than males. Cohort studies of adolescents and young adults followed up for approximately 15 years estimated an incidence of hand eczema of approximately 9 to 12 per 1000 person-years [5,6]. In a German study, the lifetime prevalence of hand eczema among adolescents at the age of 15 was 10.4 percent (95% CI 8.9-12.1) [7]. Based on data from 11 European studies, the overall pooled incidence of hand eczema in the general population has been estimated at 7.3 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI 5.4-9.5) [4].\n【6】 Hand eczema is also the most common occupational skin disease. The incidence of occupational hand dermatitis has been estimated between 0.7 and 1.5 cases per 1000 workers per year [8]. Estimated prevalence ranges between 2 and 30 percent [9]. Incidence is highest among workers performing \"wet work\" (eg, health care workers, food handlers, hairdressers). A Danish study of health care workers found a one-year prevalence of hand eczema of 21 percent and a lifetime prevalence of 35 percent [10]. A similar study of Hong Kong nurses found a prevalence rate of 22 percent [11].\n【7】 A 2022 meta-analysis of 19 studies including 15,000 hairdressers found a pooled lifetime prevalence of hand eczema of 38 percent and an overall incidence rate of 51.8 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI 42.6-61.0) [12].\n【8】 Because these numbers represent only the cases reported, they are likely an underestimate of the true prevalence. Studies have shown that occupational hand dermatitis is often underreported. In one study involving over 2000 hairdressers with chronic hand eczema, only 21 percent had reported their hand eczema as occupational to the workers' compensation authority [13]. A similar study of health care workers found that only 12 percent reported their hand eczema [10].\n【9】 ●Risk factors – In a 2022, Finnish, population-based study that included 6830 individuals, hand eczema was reported in 900 individuals (13.3 percent) [14]. Strong risk factors for hand eczema included a personal history of atopic dermatitis (odds ratio [OR] 11.8, 95% CI 10.1-13.9), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (OR 2.96, 95% CI 2.55-3.44), or asthma (OR 2.39, 95% CI 2.03-2.81).\n【10】 A 2022 analysis of data from the Netherlands LifeLines Cohort Study that included over 58,000 participants found a positive association between chronic hand eczema and female sex, atopic dermatitis, and exposure to wet activities [15]. In addition, cigarette smoking and being overweight and obese were also positively associated with having chronic hand eczema in the past year.\n【11】 In a 2022 meta-analysis of 29 observational studies, hand washing multiple times per day (8 to 10 times per day or more) was also associated with an increased risk of hand eczema (relative risk [RR] 1.48, 95% CI 1.30-1.67 for health care workers and RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.13-2.34 for non-health care workers) [16].\n【12】 ●Genetic susceptibility – There is an association between the susceptibility to hand eczema and loss-of-function mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG), which is important for the integrity of the epidermal barrier [17]. Filaggrin is involved in terminal differentiation of the skin with appropriate keratin filament alignment and stratum corneum hydration. Loss-of-function filaggrin polymorphisms predispose to xerosis, ichthyosis vulgaris, and atopic eczema [18]. (See  \"Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Epidermal barrier dysfunction'.)\n【13】 ●Wet work – Repetitive wet work exposure is recognized as a predisposing factor for hand eczema. Water exposure for more than three hours per day can induce physiologic changes in the normal skin and increase the susceptibility to skin irritation [19]. Studies of occupational hand eczema in health care workers have found an association with hand-washing practices, such as the daily number of hand washes with soap at work and time working with disposable gloves [16,20]. However, the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer does not seem to increase the risk of hand eczema [16]. Unprotected wet work for more than two hours a day in hairdressers has been shown to be a significant risk factor for the development of hand eczema [21].\n【14】 ●Irritants/allergens – Irritants often play an important role in both the development and persistence of hand eczema. In addition to water, important irritants include detergents, fragrances, and preservatives in hand soaps; harsh chemicals found in common household and industrial cleaners, such as ammonia and solvents; raw fruits, vegetables, spices, and plants; and physical irritants (eg, metal tools, wood, fiberglass, dust/soil). (See  \"Irritant contact dermatitis in adults\".)\n【15】 Hand eczema may also be a manifestation of allergic contact dermatitis, a specific T cell-mediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Contact sensitization has been reported in over 60 percent of patients with hand eczema [22,23]. Common allergens include nickel, formaldehyde, quaternium-15, methylisothiazolinone, and fragrance mix. (See 'Patch testing' below and  \"Clinical features and diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis\".)\n【16】 Chronic or recurrent hand eczema is also the most frequent clinical manifestation of contact urticaria/protein contact dermatitis (CU/PCD), a distinct type of dermatitis induced by a type I immediate hypersensitivity reaction to high molecular weight allergens, such as animal or plant proteins in previously sensitized individuals [24,25]. CU/PCD predominantly occurs in food handlers, cooks, veterinarians, or farmers [26]. Patients with CU/PCD usually have a positive prick test or specific serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) to certain foods but negative patch tests [27,28]. The reaction usually starts as an urticarial allergic response, but with repeated episodes over time, the clinical appearance is that of chronic eczema.\n【17】 ●Clinical variants – Clinical variants of hand eczema include [29,30]:\n【18】 ●Pattern and distribution of lesions – The pattern and distribution of the hand lesions may vary depending on the etiology [31]:\n【19】 ●Acute stage – In the acute stage, a classic, spongiotic reaction pattern is seen, including intercellular edema, microvesicle formation, and a superficial dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes, with or without eosinophils.\n【20】 ●Chronic stage – As the dermatosis progresses to the chronic stage, the degree of spongiosis is often mild and epidermal acanthosis, parakeratosis, and hyperkeratosis predominate, with a superficial, perivascular, lymphohistiocytic, inflammatory infiltrate.\n【21】 ●Type of work or hobbies\n【22】 ●Potential exposures to irritants or allergens\n【23】 ●Duration and frequency of exposure\n【24】 ●Type of personal protective equipment used\n【25】 ●Personal or family history of atopy, such as asthma, hay fever, allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, or childhood eczema\n【26】 ●Preservatives\n【27】 ●Fragrances\n【28】 ●Metals (eg, nickel, cobalt)\n【29】 ●Rubber\n【30】 ●Topical antibiotics (eg, bacitracin, neomycin)\n【31】 ●A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation may be useful to exclude a dermatophyte infection.\n【32】 ●Bacterial cultures may be useful to guide treatment in patients with clinical signs of superinfected hand eczema.\n【33】 ●A scabies preparation may be helpful to exclude Sarcoptes scabiei infestation.\n【34】 ●Mild eczema – Mild eczema is defined by the presence of two or more mild skin changes (erythema, scaling, hyperkeratosis, lichenification, vesiculation, edema, fissures, pruritus, and pain) involving <10 percent of the hand surface (picture 1A).\n【35】 ●Moderate eczema – Moderate eczema is defined by the presence of two or more mild to moderate skin changes (erythema, scaling, hyperkeratosis, lichenification, vesiculation, edema, fissures, pruritus, and pain) involving 10 to 30 percent of the hand surface (picture 2B).\n【36】 ●Severe eczema – Severe eczema is defined by the presence of two or more moderate to severe skin changes (erythema, scaling, hyperkeratosis, lichenification, vesiculation, edema, fissures, pruritus, and pain) involving >30 percent of the hand surface (picture 3A).\n【37】 ●Palmoplantar plaque psoriasis – Palmoplantar psoriasis presents with thick, scaly papules or plaques on an erythematous base. Lesions may be present on the palmar or dorsal surface of the hand (picture 11). The presence of nail pitting and/or classic, psoriatic plaques on other body sites is a clue to the diagnosis. In patients with isolated hand involvement, a skin biopsy may be helpful in rendering the correct diagnosis. (See  \"Psoriasis: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\".)\n【38】 ●Palmoplantar pustulosis – Palmoplantar pustulosis is a chronic, inflammatory dermatosis characterized by the development of recurrent crops of discrete, 1 to 10 mm, sterile pustules limited to the palms and/or soles (picture 12A-C). It is often viewed as an isolated subset of acral psoriasis. Usually, it can be differentiated from chronic hand eczema on clinical grounds. In atypical cases, a skin biopsy showing an intraepidermal pustule filled with polymorphonuclear leukocytes associated with epidermal spongiosis can clarify the diagnosis. (See  \"Palmoplantar pustulosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis\".)\n【39】 ●Tinea manuum – Tinea manuum is a dermatophyte infection that typically involves one hand and presents with erythema and fine scaling of the palm. In most cases, patients have a concomitant infection of the feet and toenails (picture 13). A potassium hydroxide (KOH) examination of scrapings from the lesions confirms the diagnosis. (See  \"Dermatophyte (tinea) infections\".)\n【40】 ●Scabies – Scabies is a common infestation of the skin caused by S. scabiei and is characterized by intense pruritus and multiple small, erythematous papules or by poorly defined, erythematous patches that develop prominent scale, crusts, and fissures (crusted scabies) (picture 14A-C). A scabies preparation can confirm the presence of scabies mites, eggs, or feces. (See  \"Scabies: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis\".)\n【41】 ●Gloves – Gloves should be worn during cooking, gardening, and cleaning to minimize exposure to irritants such as raw meat, vegetables, and chemicals.\n【42】 Vinyl or other nonlatex gloves are suitable for many routine exposures. Vinyl gloves are generally preferred to latex or rubber gloves due to the lesser presence of potential allergens. When protective gloves are to be used for intervals longer than 10 minutes, a thin cotton glove should be worn underneath. This will provide an absorbent layer and prevent sweat from irritating the skin with longer glove use. The cotton gloves can be washed and reused.\n【43】 For occupational exposures, environmental hazards need to be considered when making the choice for protective glove recommendations. The patient should be encouraged to discuss appropriate protective equipment with their employer. The material safety and data sheet (MSDS) for a given chemical can be helpful and may list appropriate glove guidelines.\n【44】 Certain materials readily penetrate various glove types, and not all gloves are suitable for all tasks. For example, acrylates that may be utilized in dentistry and orthopedics can easily penetrate many rubber and vinyl gloves. Therefore, if an individual is allergic to acrylates, a foil-type 4H chemical-resistant glove may be required under vinyl or rubber gloves [49]. It is also important that protective gloves be intact without holes, clean and dry on the inside, and the appropriate size.\n【45】 ●\"Barrier creams\" – So-called \"barrier creams\" are formulated to mimic the intercellular lipids, which are composed of ceramides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol, with the aim to limit the penetration of hazardous chemicals into the epidermis. They can either be water repellent or oil repellent. However, their superior efficacy compared with common emollients is unproven, and they cannot be used to replace gloves and other personal protective equipment [50-54]. Nonetheless, they may be utilized to augment protection against low-grade irritants.\n【46】 ●Initial treatment – We typically use high-potency or super high-potency topical corticosteroids (groups 1 to 3 (table 2)). Topical corticosteroids are applied once or twice a day for two to four weeks or until a stable improvement is achieved. Emollients should be applied liberally multiple times per day.\n【47】 ●Maintenance treatment – After induction of remission, we suggest maintenance intermittent therapy with a low- to mid-potency topical corticosteroid (groups 4 to 6 (table 2)) two to three times per week (eg, every other day or during weekends) to prevent relapses. Intermittent therapy can be continued for several months.\n【48】 ●Management of relapses – Relapses are treated by resuming daily use of topical corticosteroids until remission. However, long-term use of topical corticosteroids (especially high- or super high-potency preparations) may induce skin atrophy, especially on the thinner skin of the dorsal hand (see  \"Topical corticosteroids: Use and adverse effects\"). Topical tacrolimus is an alternative to topical corticosteroids for patients with frequent relapses. (See 'Topical calcineurin inhibitors' below.)\n【49】 ●Efficacy – Although topical corticosteroids are widely used as a first-line therapy for hand eczema, data from randomized trials supporting their use are limited [39]:\n【50】 ●In a small, randomized trial of 30 patients with allergic contact hand eczema, tacrolimus 0.1% ointment appeared similarly effective as mometasone furoate 0.1% ointment in reducing erythema, infiltration, vesiculation, desquamation, fissuring, and itching at three months [60].\n【51】 ●In a small, uncontrolled study of 29 patients with occupational chronic hand dermatitis treated with tacrolimus 0.1% ointment for four weeks, 12 patients were clear of eczema at the end of the study [59].\n【52】 ●In a randomized trial, 652 patients with mild to moderate chronic hand dermatitis were treated with pimecrolimus 1% cream or vehicle twice daily with overnight occlusion for six weeks [61]. At the end of the study, the proportions of patients achieving the primary end point (Investigator Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 [clear/almost clear]) were similar in the pimecrolimus and vehicle groups (30 versus 23 percent, respectively).\n【53】 ●In a left-to-right comparison study, 15 patients with chronic hand eczema were treated with local NBUVB or topical PUVA [70]. Complete clearance or marked clinical improvement (defined as 75 percent improvement in the baseline severity score) occurred in the NBUVB phototherapy-treated side in 11 of 12 patients and in the PUVA-treated side in 10 of 12 patients.\n【54】 ●In a randomized trial, 60 patients with hand eczema unresponsive to super high-potency topical corticosteroids were treated with topical PUVA or NBUVB twice weekly for 12 weeks [73]. At the end of the study, 43 percent of patients in the PUVA group and 23 percent of patients in the NBUVB group achieved the primary outcome of a Physician Global Assessment (PGA) score of 0 or 1 (clear/almost clear).\n【55】 ●Epidemiology – Hand eczema, or hand dermatitis, is a common, inflammatory disorder involving skin of the hands that affects approximately 4 percent of the general population. It is also the most frequent occupational skin disease, with an incidence of 0.7 to 1.5 cases per 1000 workers per year. Hand eczema is especially common among workers exposed to \"wet work,\" such as health care workers, food handlers, and hairdressers. (See 'Introduction' above and 'Epidemiology' above.)\n【56】 ●Clinical presentation – In the acute stage, hand eczema typically presents with erythema, edema, weeping, and vesiculation (picture 2A-B). As lesions become subacute or chronic, scaling, thickening, and fissuring of the skin become the predominant clinical signs (picture 3A). (See 'Clinical manifestations' above.)\n【57】 ●Diagnosis – The diagnosis of hand eczema is based upon a detailed history, physical examination, and patch testing. (See 'Diagnosis' above.)\n【58】 ●Management – The management of chronic hand eczema involves patient education about avoidance of irritants and allergens, skin protection measures, and anti-inflammatory therapy (see 'General principles' above):\n【59】 ●Prognosis – Hand eczema often has a very prolonged course and may have significant psychosocial consequences, such as social stigma, long-term sick leaves, and job loss.

If oral digoxin ingestion/overdose from elixir or tablets, the total body load should be calculated based on the following equation:\n【8】 Total body load (mg) = 0.8 x [amount (mg) digoxin tablets or elixir ingested]\n【9】 Step 2: Calculate number of vials needed: Each vial of digoxin immune Fab 40 mg will bind ~0.5 mg of digoxin.\n【10】 Digoxin Immune Fab Dose (vials) = Total body digoxin load (mg) / 0.5 mg/vial\n【11】 Digoxin Immune Fab Dose (mg) = [(serum digoxin concentration [ng/mL] x weight [kg]) / 100] x 40 mg/vial\n【12】 Dosing: Pediatric\n【13】 Digoxin toxicity\n【14】 Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric\n【15】 All patients: There are no pediatric specific recommendations provided; use with caution; elimination of Fab-digoxin fragments may be prolonged with renal impairment; patients should have serum digoxin levels monitored closely (including unbound if possible) to identify/prevent recurrence of toxicity and to determine an appropriate time for re-digitalization (if applicable).\n【16】 Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Pediatric\n【17】 There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer’s labeling.\n【18】 Dosing: Adult\n【19】 (For additional information see \"Digoxin immune Fab: Drug information\")\n【20】 Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Adult\n【21】 There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling; however, use with caution since digoxin-digoxin immune Fab complex is renally eliminated. Patients should undergo prolonged monitoring for recurrence of toxicity.\n【22】 Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Adult\n【23】 There are no dosage adjustments provided in the manufacturer's labeling.\n【24】 Adverse Reactions\n【25】 The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified. Frequency not defined.\n【26】 Cardiovascular: Orthostatic hypotension, phlebitis, ventricular tachycardia (patients with atrial fibrillation; due to digoxin withdrawal), worsening of heart failure (due to digoxin withdrawal)\n【27】 Endocrine & metabolic: Hypokalemia\n【28】 Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reaction, serum sickness\n【29】 Contraindications\n【30】 There are no contraindications listed in the manufacturer’s labeling.\n【31】 Warnings/Precautions\n【32】 • Hypersensitivity reactions: Digoxin immune Fab is derived from ovine (sheep) Fab immunoglobulin fragments; hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions, delayed allergic reactions) are possible. Patients with allergies to sheep proteins and patients with prior exposure to ovine antibodies or ovine Fab may be at a higher risk for  anaphylactic reactions. In patients who develop an anaphylactic reaction, discontinue the infusion immediately and administer emergency care; balance the need for epinephrine against its potential risk in the setting of digitalis toxicity.\n【33】 Processed with papain and may cause hypersensitivity reactions in patients allergic to papaya, other papaya extracts, papain, chymopapain, or the pineapple-enzyme bromelain. There may also be cross allergenicity with dust mite and latex allergens.\n【34】 • Potassium imbalance: Patients experiencing acute digitalis toxicity may present with significant hyperkalemia due to shifting of potassium into the extracellular space. Upon treatment with digoxin immune Fab, potassium shifts back into the intracellular space and may result in hypokalemia.  Monitor potassium closely, especially during the first few hours after administration; treat hypokalemia cautiously when clinically indicated.\n【35】 • Heart failure (HF): In patients chronically maintained on digoxin for HF, administration of digoxin immune Fab may result in exacerbation of HF symptoms due to a reduction in digoxin serum concentration. If reinitiation is required, consider postponing until Fab fragments have been eliminated completely; elimination may take several days or longer, especially in patients with renal impairment.\n【36】 • Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal failure (experience limited); the Fab-digoxin complex will be eliminated more slowly. Toxicity may recur; prolonged monitoring for recurrence of symptoms and evaluation of free (unbound) digoxin concentrations (if test available) may be warranted in this patient population.\n【37】 Dosage Forms: US\n【38】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【39】 Solution Reconstituted, Intravenous [preservative free]:\n【40】 DigiFab: 40 mg (1 ea)\n【41】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【42】 No\n【43】 Pricing: US\n【44】 40 mg (per each): $5,518.80\n【45】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【46】 Solution Reconstituted, Intravenous:\n【47】 Administration: Pediatric\n【48】 Parenteral: IV: Administration by IV infusion over at least 30 minutes is preferable. May also be administered by bolus injection if cardiac arrest is imminent (infusion-related reaction may occur). If an infusion-related reaction occurs, discontinue the infusion and reinitiate at a slower rate.\n【49】 Administration: Adult\n【50】 Storage/Stability\n【51】 Store vials at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); do not freeze. If not used immediately, reconstituted solution may be stored at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 4 hours.\n【52】 Use\n【53】 Treatment of potentially life-threatening digoxin intoxication in carefully selected patients (FDA approved in pediatric patients [age not specified] and adults):\n【54】 Acute digoxin ingestion (ie, >10 mg in adults; >0.1 mg/kg or >4 mg in children; ingestions resulting in steady-state serum concentrations ≥10 ng/mL)\n【55】 Chronic ingestions leading to steady-state digoxin concentrations >6 ng/mL in adults or >4 ng/mL in children\n【56】 Manifestations of life-threatening digoxin toxicity (eg, severe ventricular arrhythmias, progressive bradycardia, second- or third-degree heart block not responsive to atropine, serum potassium >5.5 mEq/L in adults or >6 mEq/L in children in presence of rapidly progressive signs of digoxin toxicity)\n【57】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【58】 None known.\n【59】 Drug Interactions\n【60】 (For additional information: Launch drug interactions program)\n【61】 There are no known significant interactions.\n【62】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【63】 Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted. In general, medications used as antidotes should take into consideration the health and prognosis of the mother; antidotes should be administered to pregnant women if there is a clear indication for use and should not be withheld because of fears of teratogenicity (Bailey, 2003).\n【64】 Monitoring Parameters\n【65】 Prior to the first dose of digoxin immune Fab evaluate serum potassium, serum digoxin concentration, and serum creatinine; closely monitor serum potassium (eg, hourly for 4 to 6 hours; at least daily thereafter), temperature, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram after administration. Total serum digoxin concentrations will rise precipitously following administration of digoxin immune Fab due to the presence of the Fab-digoxin complex; because digoxin bound to Fab fragments is not physiologically active this rise has no clinical meaning. Therefore, avoid monitoring total serum digoxin concentrations until the Fab fragments have been eliminated completely; this may be several days to weeks in patients with renal impairment (Ujhelyi 1995). Monitor for volume overload in infants and small children (<20 kg). Monitor for signs and symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction.\n【66】 Mechanism of Action\n【67】 Digoxin immune antigen-binding fragments (Fab) are specific antibodies for the treatment of digitalis intoxication in carefully selected patients; binds with molecules of digoxin and is then excreted by the kidneys and removed from the body.\n【68】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【69】 Onset of action: IV: Digitalis toxicity: Improvement may be seen within 20 to 90 minutes (Betten, 2006)\n【70】 Distribution: Vd: 0.3 L/kg\n【71】 Half-life elimination: 15 to 20 hours; may be increased up to 10-fold in patient with renal impairment\n【72】 Excretion: Urine (concentrations declining within 5 to 7 days)\n【73】 Brand Names: International\n【74】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Digoxin immune Fab  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/digoxin-immune-fab-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E5%AE%9E%E8%AF%81%EF%BC%88TM1%EF%BC%89&source=search_result&selectedTitle=136%7E138&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

In a radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) an individual presents without overt clinical symptoms but with MRI findings highly suggestive of MS. CIS and RIS can create diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, since a substantial percentage of patients with CIS and MRI lesions go on to develop clinically definite MS.\n【2】 This topic will discuss the management of CIS and of RIS suggestive of MS.\n【3】 Other aspects of MS are discussed separately. (See  \"Clinical presentation, course, and prognosis of multiple sclerosis in adults\" and  \"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults\" and  \"Manifestations of multiple sclerosis in adults\" and  \"Initial disease-modifying therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults\" and  \"Treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis in adults\" and  \"Symptom management of multiple sclerosis in adults\" and  \"Optic neuritis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis\" and  \"Optic neuritis: Prognosis and treatment\".)\n【4】 CLINICALLY ISOLATED SYNDROME — A CIS is the first clinical episode that is consistent with a demyelinating etiology and suggestive of MS, as described in detail separately. (See  \"Clinical presentation, course, and prognosis of multiple sclerosis in adults\", section on 'Clinically isolated syndrome'.)\n【5】 The typical patient with a CIS is a young adult with a single episode of central nervous system dysfunction, such as unilateral optic neuritis, a focal brain syndrome, a focal brainstem or cerebellar syndrome, or partial myelopathy [1]. Symptoms usually develop over the course of hours to days and then gradually remit over the ensuing weeks to months, though remission may not be complete. While CIS is, by definition, isolated to a single attack in time, it is not necessarily isolated in space, as approximately one-quarter of patients present with multifocal abnormalities. CIS should not be considered a different disease than MS, rather it is a potential precursor to MS. As the diagnostic criteria for MS have expanded, fewer patients meet the strict criteria for CIS.\n【6】 RADIOLOGICALLY ISOLATED SYNDROME — An RIS is defined by incidental brain or spinal cord MRI findings that are highly suggestive of MS, based upon location and morphology within the central nervous system, in an asymptomatic patient lacking any history, symptoms, or signs of MS [2]. Typically, the MRI has been obtained for a completely unrelated condition such as headaches or trauma.\n【7】 INITIAL EVALUATION — All patients with a CIS should have neuroimaging with a contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain and the spinal cord in order to determine whether there is an explanatory acute inflammatory lesion in the brain or spinal cord and whether there are additional lesions on MRI that are indicative of MS. The evaluation of a CIS and suspected MS is described in detail elsewhere. (See  \"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults\", section on 'Evaluation'.)\n【8】 We suggest cerebrospinal fluid examination for patients with a CIS who have a brain MRI that shows no or few lesions (ie, MRI findings that do not meet the McDonald criteria for dissemination in space). Qualitative assessment of cerebrospinal fluid using isoelectric focusing for oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) bands that are not present in a concomitant serum specimen can help to refine the risk estimation for progression to MS in equivocal cases. Elevation of the cerebrospinal fluid immunoglobulin level relative to other protein components is also a common finding in patients with MS and suggests intrathecal synthesis. A positive cerebrospinal fluid is based upon the finding of either oligoclonal bands different from any such bands in serum, or by an increased IgG index. The IgG level may be expressed as a percentage of total protein (normal <11 percent), as a percentage of albumin (normal <27 percent), by use of the calculated IgG index (normal value <0.66 to <0.9, depending upon the individual laboratory), or by use of a formula for intrathecal fluid synthesis of IgG. Thus, the presence of oligoclonal bands can provide supportive evidence that the underlying disorder is inflammatory and demyelinating. (See 'With oligoclonal bands' below.)\n【9】 The diagnosis of MS can be made for some patients at the time they present with a first clinical attack (ie, a CIS) if a single MRI obtained at any time shows dissemination in space and, as evidence for dissemination in time, by the simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and nonenhancing lesions, or by the presence of cerebrospinal fluid-specific oligoclonal bands. (See  \"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults\", section on 'For a clinically isolated syndrome'.)\n【10】 In select cases, testing for anti-AQP4 or anti-MOG antibodies may be appropriate. (See  \"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults\", section on 'Autoantibody testing'.)\n【11】 A patient with an RIS, identified by incidental findings on a brain MRI, is asymptomatic by definition and has no history, symptoms, or signs of MS, but follow-up is important to monitor for the possible onset of clinical features consistent with MS. However, some experts recommend lumbar puncture in patients with an RIS who have high-risk MRI features, such as a large number of demyelinating brain lesions (hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted MRI) or even a single demyelinating spinal cord lesion, since the additional finding of oligoclonal bands would suggest an increased risk of conversion to MS [3].\n【12】 The differential diagnosis of CIS and RIS is essentially the same as the differential of MS and includes a number of inflammatory, vascular, infectious, genetic, granulomatous, and other demyelinating disorders (table 1). This is discussed in detail separately. (See  \"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults\", section on 'Differential diagnosis'.)\n【13】 RISK OF PROGRESSION TO MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS — Identification of those patients with RIS or CIS who are likely to progress to MS is a major goal of current research.\n【14】 Overall risk with a CIS — In various studies, the long-term (ie, 10- to 20-year) likelihood of developing MS for patients with CIS and MRI lesions characteristic of MS ranges from 60 to 80 percent [4-9], with most of the data suggesting that the true rate of conversion is closer to the lower end of this range. In patients with a CIS who have a normal baseline MRI, limited data suggest that the long-term prevalence of MS is approximately 20 percent [7].\n【15】 Therefore, patients with a CIS who have MRI abnormalities characteristic of MS in these MS-typical regions (periventricular, cortical or juxtacortical, infratentorial, and spinal cord) either at presentation or within three to six months of the event are candidates for early disease-modifying therapy. (See 'Who should receive early DMT?' below.)\n【16】 After isolated optic neuritis — In the Optic Neuritis Treatment trial (ONTT), the cumulative five-year incidence of clinically definite MS was 30 percent following a first episode of idiopathic demyelinating optic neuritis [10]. The cumulative incidence increased to 40 percent at 12 years [11], and to 50 percent at 15 years [6]. The presence of characteristic demyelinating lesions on brain MRI is a strong predictor of developing MS (image 1). In the ONTT, the risk of MS after 10 years was 56 percent among those with one or more lesions on MRI versus 22 percent among those with no lesions [11].\n【17】 Optic neuritis is discussed in detail separately. (See  \"Optic neuritis: Prognosis and treatment\".)\n【18】 After acute transverse myelitis — Acute transverse myelitis is an inflammatory disorder that presents with the rapid onset of weakness, sensory alterations, and bowel and bladder dysfunction. (See  \"Transverse myelitis\".)\n【19】 Patients presenting with acute complete transverse myelitis (complete or near complete clinical deficits below the lesion) have a generally cited risk of MS of only 5 to 10 percent [12], although some reports suggest a higher conversion rate [13]. However, partial or incomplete myelitis with mild or grossly asymmetric spinal cord dysfunction is a much more common clinical entity and bears more relevance to MS. Patients who have acute partial myelitis as an initial presentation and cranial MRI abnormalities showing lesions typical for MS have a transition rate to MS over three to five years of 60 to 90 percent [13-15]. By contrast, patients with acute partial myelitis who have a normal brain MRI develop MS at a rate of only 10 to 30 percent over a similar time period [16]. Studies suggest that patients with monosymptomatic disease who have positive oligoclonal bands have a higher risk of evolution to MS than those without oligoclonal bands [17].\n【20】 With oligoclonal bands — In patients with CIS, the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid may be an independent risk factor for progression to MS. Supporting evidence comes from a prospective study of 415 patients with CIS, which found that the presence of oligoclonal bands was associated with a significantly increased risk of developing clinically definite MS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.7) [18]. This increased risk was independent of the number of lesions on baseline MRI. Among 113 patients with a negative MRI (ie, no lesions), the risk of developing MS in those with and without oligoclonal bands was 23 and 4 percent, respectively. These findings suggest that progression to MS is unlikely in patients with a CIS who have few or no MRI lesions and no oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid [9].\n【21】 Risk with an RIS — Patients with an RIS are at risk of developing CIS and MS, but data are limited. One of the largest studies evaluated an international cohort of over 450 retrospectively identified subjects (approximately 78 percent female) with RIS from 22 databases [19]. With a mean follow-up of 4.4 years, independent predictors for the development of a first clinical event were younger age (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-0.99), male sex (HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.24-2.99), and asymptomatic MRI lesions in the cervical or thoracic spinal cord (HR 3.08, 95% CI 2.06-4.62). Conversion to symptomatic MS occurred in approximately 30 percent; of those who converted to MS, criteria for primary progressive MS were met in 12 percent [20]. Another study of 75 patients with RIS found that the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid was associated with an increased risk of conversion to MS [21].\n【22】 These data and expert consensus suggest that patients with an RIS have an increased risk of subclinical MS if and one or more of following features are present [22]:\n【23】 ●Age <35 years\n【24】 ●Male sex\n【25】 ●Cervical or thoracic spinal cord lesions on MRI\n【26】 ●Dissemination in time on MRI (gadolinium-enhancing and/or new T2 lesions)\n【27】 ●High T2 lesion load on MRI\n【28】 ●Cortical and/or juxtacortical lesions on MRI\n【29】 ●Presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid\n【30】 ●Abnormal visual evoked potentials\n【31】 ●Deficits of specific cognitive functions (ie, information processing speed, complex attention, episodic memory, and executive functions)\n【32】 Other features are \"red flags\" that suggest an alternative diagnosis [22]:\n【33】 ●Migraine or chronic headache\n【34】 ●Seizures\n【35】 ●Paroxysmal symptoms\n【36】 ●Psychiatric disturbances\n【37】 ●Overt cognitive impairment\n【38】 ●Head trauma\n【39】 The presence of \"red flag\" features casts doubt on a diagnosis of RIS, and should prompt consideration of other conditions that may explain the symptoms.\n【40】 Larger prospective studies are needed to better define the risk of MS associated with RIS.\n【41】 MANAGEMENT — An acute relapse in a patient with CIS should be managed with oral or intravenous glucocorticoids, as is done for acute exacerbations of MS. (See  \"Treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults\".)\n【42】 Further management of patients with a CIS or RIS includes monitoring for manifestations of MS disease activity and deciding about early disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for select patients with a CIS.\n【43】 Monitoring — Patients with a CIS or RIS should be monitored for possible manifestations of MS disease activity including acute clinical attacks (relapses), new lesions on MRI, and onset or progression of sustained disability. Our preferred protocol is to assess the clinical status of patients routinely (eg, every three to six months or as needed) with a neurologic examination and sometimes with the full Expanded Disability Status Scale (table 2).\n【44】 We obtain a repeat brain or spine MRI whenever there are new clinical symptoms suggestive of MS.\n【45】 For patients without new symptoms, the following imaging schedule and treatment strategy is suggested:\n【46】 ●For patients with a CIS and a normal baseline brain MRI (ie, no demyelinating lesions), a brain MRI should be repeated between three and six months, and, if stable, another MRI should be obtained one year later. If these serial MRIs are stable, further scanning is recommended only if there are new symptoms. If any of the serial brain MRI scans show the interval development of hyperintense T2 lesions that are characteristic of MS in at least two of four MS-typical regions, treatment with a DMT is suggested. (See 'Who should receive early DMT?' below.)\n【47】 ●For patients with a CIS and demyelinating lesions on baseline brain or spine MRI who were not started on early DMT, follow-up brain MRI every 6 to 12 months is suggested [23].\n【48】 ●For patients started on a DMT, a brain MRI is warranted approximately three to six months after starting treatment, and annually thereafter [23]. (See 'Follow-up' below.)\n【49】 ●For patients with an RIS who remain asymptomatic, a repeat brain MRI at 6 to 12 months and then at yearly intervals for up to five years is suggested.\n【50】 Who should receive early DMT? — The results of randomized controlled trials cited below support early DMT of suspected MS for patients with CIS who have additional clinically silent lesions in the brain or spinal cord detected by MRI (see 'Efficacy of DMTs' below). We suggest disease-modifying treatment for patients with a CIS who do not fulfill McDonald criteria for a diagnosis of MS but have an abnormal brain MRI with one or more hyperintense T2 lesions that are characteristic of MS in at least two of four MS-typical regions at presentation or within three to six months of the event.\n【51】 Currently, there is no clear indication for the use of disease-modifying treatment for patients with RIS (ie, asymptomatic but with incidental MRI findings suggestive of MS) [24]. (See 'Radiologically isolated syndrome' above.)\n【52】 All patients with a CIS who meet diagnostic criteria for MS should be started on a DMT. (See  \"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults\", section on 'For a clinically isolated syndrome' and  \"Initial disease-modifying therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults\".)\n【53】 Approved DMTs — Most DMTs approved for relapsing forms of MS are also approved in the United States for the treatment of CIS. These are:\n【54】 ●Platform injection therapies: Interferons and glatiramer acetate (see  \"Disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis: Pharmacology, administration, and adverse effects\", section on 'Platform injection therapies')\n【55】 ●Oral therapies (see  \"Disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis: Pharmacology, administration, and adverse effects\", section on 'Oral therapies'):\n【56】 ●Monoclonal antibodies: Natalizumab, ocrelizumab, and ofatumumab (see  \"Disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis: Pharmacology, administration, and adverse effects\", section on 'Monoclonal antibodies')\n【57】 However, not all DMTs approved for CIS have been tested specifically for the treatment of CIS. (See 'Efficacy of DMTs' below.)\n【58】 Choice of DMT — The recombinant human interferon beta agents or glatiramer acetate are options for high-risk patients with a CIS. Teriflunomide is an alternative for patients who prefer oral therapy, but its use is contraindicated for women of child-bearing potential because of the risk of teratogenicity, and monthly lab testing is indicated for the first six months to screen for potential hepatoxicity. These medications were often used because of their benign safety profile and clinical trial data supporting their efficacy in CIS. (See 'Efficacy of DMTs' below.)\n【59】 Among the interferons, we prefer treatment with recombinant human interferon beta-1a 30 mcg/week by intramuscular injection or pegylated interferon beta-1a, which is administered by subcutaneous injection every two weeks, beginning with 63 mcg on day one, 94 mcg on day 15, and 125 mcg every 14 days beginning on day 29.\n【60】 Interferon beta-1a is also available in formulations for subcutaneous injection, with a target dose of either 22 mcg or 44 mcg given three times weekly. Prescribing information in the United States recommends initial treatment starting at 8.8 mcg three times a week, gradually increasing over four weeks to the final recommended dose of 44 mcg three times a week. Doses of subcutaneous interferon beta-1a should be separated by at least 48 hours.\n【61】 Injection site reactions, flu-like symptoms, and asymptomatic liver dysfunction (transaminitis) are relatively common adverse effects of interferons. \"Needle-fatigue\" is common as well after prolonged use. (See 'Interferons' below and  \"Disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis: Pharmacology, administration, and adverse effects\", section on 'Interferons'.)\n【62】 Other DMTs, such as oral fumarates (eg, dimethyl fumarate), the sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators (eg, fingolimod), have not been studied specifically in CIS, but given their efficacy in relapsing-remitting MS, they are likely effective for CIS and they are approved for CIS. Many patients prefer oral over injectable medications, and it is reasonable to start one of these medications in patients with CIS.\n【63】 Several monoclonal antibody DMTs (natalizumab, ocrelizumab, and ofatumumab) are also approved for CIS, but they are not usually considered first-line for CIS because of the increased risk of serious adverse effect. (See  \"Initial disease-modifying therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults\".)\n【64】 Follow-up — Patients on DMT should have clinical follow-up with careful attention to possible manifestations of disease activity including acute attacks (relapses) and onset or progression of sustained disability. Many or most experienced clinicians supplement the clinical information with periodic MRI studies to monitor the development of new asymptomatic lesions. (See 'Monitoring' above.)\n【65】 Patients with CIS who progress to a diagnosis of clinically definite MS may benefit by modification of disease-modifying treatment, as discussed separately. (See  \"Initial disease-modifying therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults\".)\n【66】 Duration of therapy — The option of stopping treatment can be discussed for patients with a CIS who remain stable for several years with no new symptomatic episodes or clinical progression and no evidence of active disease by MRI.\n【67】 Efficacy of DMTs — The results of randomized controlled trials cited below support early disease-modifying therapy of suspected MS for patients with CIS who have additional clinically silent lesions in the brain or spinal cord detected by MRI. Early treatment beginning prior to the technical diagnosis of MS is likely to have a greater impact than later treatment on delaying disease progression to MS. However, the benefit of early CIS treatment for reducing disability is not firmly established. A 2017 meta-analysis found only low-quality evidence suggesting a small and uncertain benefit of early DMT treatment compared with placebo [25], whereas a prospective cohort study found that a longer exposure time to DMT was associated with reduced disability [26].\n【68】 DMTs with evidence of efficacy for CIS include interferons, glatiramer acetate, and teriflunomide, as reviewed below.\n【69】 A trial of patients with RIS (n = 44) found that dimethyl fumarate reduced the risk of a first acute clinical event compared with placebo, but confidence in the results is limited by small patient numbers, a high dropout rate, and early stopping [27].\n【70】 Interferons — Early treatment with recombinant human interferon beta (IFNB) for patients with CIS delays the occurrence of a second attack, and therefore the onset of clinically definite MS, for up to five years [28-35]. However, early treatment in patients with CIS has not been shown to prevent long-term disability.\n【71】 The effectiveness of IFNB for patients with CIS was examined in a meta-analysis published in 2008 that identified three trials (ETOMS, CHAMPS, and BENEFIT) with a total of 1160 patients (639 treatment and 521 placebo) [32]. The probability of converting to clinically definite MS was significantly lower with IFNB treatment compared with placebo both at one year (pooled odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.40-0.71) and at two years of follow-up (pooled OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.38-0.70).\n【72】 At least three randomized controlled trials (CHAMPS, ETOMS, and REFLEX) have investigated recombinant human interferon beta-1a for patients with CIS. One trial (BENEFIT) evaluated recombinant human interferon beta-1b for patients with CIS.\n【73】 ●The CHAMPS trial enrolled 383 patients who had suffered a first acute clinical demyelinating event and who also had evidence of prior subclinical demyelination on brain MRI [28]. During three years of follow-up, patients treated with glucocorticoid therapy followed by weekly intramuscular injections of recombinant human interferon beta-1a 30 mcg had a significantly lower probability of developing clinically definite MS than those treated with glucocorticoids followed by placebo injections (cumulative probability 35 versus 50 percent).\n【74】 All patients in CHAMPS were offered weekly intramuscular injections of recombinant human interferon beta-1a (30 mcg) in an ongoing open-label extension study called the CHAMPIONS study [33]. Patients initially assigned to recombinant human interferon beta-1a in CHAMPS were considered the immediate treatment group and those initially assigned to placebo were considered the delayed treatment group. At five years, the immediate treatment group continued to have a lower risk of developing clinically definite MS compared with the delayed treatment group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.57; 95% CI 0.38-0.86). Few patients in either the immediate or delayed treatment group developed major disability within five years (11 versus 14 percent).\n【75】 ●The ETOMS trial enrolled 308 patients with a CIS and MRI findings suggestive of MS [29]. With two years of follow-up, significantly fewer patients developed clinically definite MS in the interferon beta-1a group (22 mcg weekly by subcutaneous injection) than in the placebo group (34 versus 45 percent). In addition, the time at which 30 percent of patients had converted to clinically definite MS was significantly longer in the recombinant human interferon beta-1a group compared with placebo (569 days versus 252). The number of new T2-weighted MRI lesions and the increase in lesion burden were also significantly lower with active treatment. A later analysis of this study population found that recombinant human interferon beta-1a treatment significantly reduced the rate of global brain atrophy compared with placebo [30].\n【76】 ●The BENEFIT trial randomly assigned 292 patients with CIS to recombinant human interferon beta-1b (250 mcg every other day by subcutaneous injection) and 176 patients to placebo [31]. At two years, significantly fewer patients treated with recombinant human interferon beta-1b had converted to clinically definite MS, a primary outcome measure, than those receiving placebo (28 and 45 percent, HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.36-0.70). Similar results were found for the co-primary outcome measure of MS as defined by the McDonald criteria (69 and 85 percent, HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.43-0.67). Active treatment was also associated with significant reductions in the cumulative number of newly active lesions and change in T2 lesion volume on brain MRI.\n【77】 In the follow-up extension studies of BENEFIT, the patients initially assigned to recombinant human interferon beta-1b (ie, the early treatment group) were compared with those who were initially assigned to placebo with the option of starting recombinant human interferon beta-1b after a diagnosis of clinically definite MS or after two years (ie, the delayed treatment group) [34-37]. Blinding to initial treatment allocation was maintained for five years. Compared with delayed treatment, early recombinant human interferon beta-1b treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the risk of developing clinically definite MS at three years (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 14 percent) [34], five years (ARR 11 percent) [35], and eight years (ARR 10 percent) [36]. However, the benefit of early treatment for preventing disability was small at three years [34] and was lost by five years [34,35,38].\n【78】 ●The REFLEX trial evaluated 517 patients with a CIS and at least two clinically silent T2 lesions on brain MRI. At two years, the probability of MS diagnosed by the McDonald criteria was significantly lower with subcutaneous interferon beta-1a 44 mcg dosed either three times a week or once a week (63 and 76 percent, versus 86 percent for placebo) [39]. In the subsequent extension phase of the trial, all patients (n = 403) received interferon beta-1a [40]. At five years, the group assigned to interferon beta-1a treatment in the placebo-controlled phase (ie, early treatment) continued to have a reduced probability of conversion to MS and fewer new MRI lesions compared with the group whose treatment was delayed for up to two years.\n【79】 Glatiramer acetate — Early treatment with glatiramer acetate delays conversion from CIS to clinically definite MS. Supporting evidence comes from the multicenter, blinded trial, PreCISe, that enrolled 481 adults with a CIS [41]. The trial was stopped early because of benefit with a mean average exposure to glatiramer of 2.3 years. By intention-to-treat analysis, glatiramer acetate therapy (20 mg subcutaneously daily) significantly reduced the risk of conversion to clinically definite MS (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40-0.77), prolonged the time for 25 percent of patients to convert to clinically definite MS (772 days, versus 336 for placebo), and reduced the frequency of conversion to clinically definite MS (25 percent, versus 43 percent with placebo). Adverse events, mainly injection site reactions and systemic allergic reactions, led to withdrawal of 6 percent of subjects assigned to glatiramer acetate.\n【80】 As noted earlier, it is unknown whether treatment with glatiramer acetate prevents or delays disability in patients with CIS.\n【81】 Teriflunomide — Teriflunomide also reduces the risk of progression to multiple sclerosis. In the TOPIC trial, 618 adults with a CIS were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment with oral teriflunomide 14 mg daily, teriflunomide 7 mg daily, or placebo for up to 108 weeks, with a median treatment duration of over 70 weeks [42]. The trial was stopped early by the sponsor upon publication of the 2010 revisions to the McDonald criteria, which allowed an earlier diagnosis of MS [43]. Compared with placebo, teriflunomide reduced the risk of relapse defining clinically definite MS at both the 14 mg dose (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.38-0.87) and the 7 mg dose (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42-0.95) [42]. The most common adverse effects of teriflunomide were elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, diarrhea, hair thinning, paresthesia, and upper respiratory tract infection.\n【82】 Because of the risk of hepatotoxicity, patients with known liver disease should not be treated with teriflunomide. Baseline transaminase and bilirubin levels should be obtained before starting treatment with teriflunomide, and ALT levels should be monitored monthly for at least six months once treatment is started. The drug should be discontinued if drug-induced liver injury is suspected. Patients should be brought up to date with all immunizations before initiating therapy with teriflunomide. Live vaccines should not be given concurrently.\n【83】 Due to the risk of teratogenicity, teriflunomide is also contraindicated for women who are pregnant or trying to conceive, and women of childbearing age must have a negative pregnancy test before starting the drug. Teriflunomide is also found in semen. While available studies have found no pregnancy safety concerns [44,45], women who become pregnant and people who wish to conceive a child should discontinue teriflunomide and undergo an accelerated drug elimination procedure, as described elsewhere. (See  \"Disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis: Pharmacology, administration, and adverse effects\", section on 'Teriflunomide'.)\n【84】 Other treatments — Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) [46] and minocycline [47,48] have been studied for the treatment of CIS or first demyelinating event, but are not established as effective.\n【85】 SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  \"Society guideline links: Multiple sclerosis and related disorders\".)\n【86】 INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, \"The Basics\" and \"Beyond the Basics.\" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【87】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on \"patient info\" and the keyword(s) of interest.)\n【88】 ●Basics topics (see  \"Patient education: Multiple sclerosis in adults (The Basics)\" and  \"Patient education: Multiple sclerosis in children (The Basics)\")\n【89】 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n【90】 ●CIS – A clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) is defined as a single first clinical episode reflecting a focal or multifocal demyelinating event in the central nervous system. The typical patient with a CIS is a young adult with a single episode of central nervous system dysfunction followed by at least partial resolution. Symptoms usually develop over the course of hours to days and then gradually remit over the ensuing weeks to months, though remission may not be complete. (See 'Clinically isolated syndrome' above.)\n【91】 ●RIS – A radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) is defined by incidental MRI findings that are highly suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS), based upon location and morphology within the central nervous system, in an asymptomatic patient lacking any history, symptoms, or signs of demyelination. (See 'Clinically isolated syndrome' above and 'Radiologically isolated syndrome' above.)\n【92】 ●Evaluation – All patients with a CIS should have neuroimaging with a contrast-enhanced MRI in order to determine whether there is an explanatory acute inflammatory lesion in the brain or spinal cord and whether there are additional lesions on MRI that are suggestive of MS. In addition, for patients with a CIS who have a brain MRI that shows no or few lesions (ie, MRI findings that do not meet the McDonald criteria for dissemination in space), we suggest cerebrospinal fluid examination, as the presence of oligoclonal bands can be helpful in determining therapy.\n【93】 The diagnosis of MS can be made for some patients at the time they present with a first clinical attack (ie, a CIS) if a single MRI obtained at any time shows dissemination in space and, as evidence for dissemination in time, the simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and nonenhancing lesions, or (as a substitute for dissemination in time) by the presence of cerebrospinal fluid-specific oligoclonal bands. (See 'Initial Evaluation' above and  \"Evaluation and diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults\", section on 'For a clinically isolated syndrome'.)\n【94】 ●Progression to MS – The long-term likelihood of progression to clinically definite MS for patients with a CIS is approximately 60 percent if the baseline brain MRI reveals demyelinating lesions suggestive of MS, and approximately 20 percent if the MRI is normal. The risk may vary according to the type of CIS (eg, optic neuritis, acute transverse myelitis) and with the presence of oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid. (See 'Risk of progression to multiple sclerosis' above.)\n【95】 ●Monitoring – Patients with a CIS or RIS should be monitored for possible manifestations of MS disease activity including acute clinical attacks (relapses), new lesions on MRI, and onset or progression of sustained disability. (See 'Monitoring' above.)\n【96】 ●Use of DMT – For patients with CIS who do not fulfill McDonald criteria for a diagnosis of MS but have an abnormal brain MRI with hyperintense T2 lesions that are characteristic of MS in at least two of four MS-typical regions at presentation or within three to six months of the event, we suggest disease-modifying treatment (DMT) with one of the recombinant human interferon beta agents or with glatiramer acetate (Grade 2A). Teriflunomide is one alternative for patients who prefer oral therapy, but its use is contraindicated for women who are pregnant or couples who are trying to conceive, and monitoring is required due to the risk of hepatotoxicity. Other alternatives include the oral fumarates and S1P receptor modulators. (See 'Choice of DMT' above and 'Efficacy of DMTs' above.)\n【97】 ●Follow-up on DMT – Patients on disease-modifying therapy should have clinical follow-up with careful attention to possible manifestations of MS disease activity and periodic MRI to monitor for new demyelinating lesions.

In newly diagnosed low-risk acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) studies, some patients who received arsenic trioxide in combination with tretinoin experienced QTc (Framingham formula) prolongation >450 msec (for males) and >460 msec (for females) throughout treatment cycles. In studies for relapsed or refractory APL, over one-third of patients who received arsenic trioxide (as monotherapy) had at least one ECG with a QTc interval >500 msec. Prolonged QTc has been observed between 1 and 5 weeks after start of arsenic trioxide treatment, and usually resolved by 8 weeks after treatment. There are no data on the effect of arsenic trioxide on the QTc interval during the infusion. The risk of torsades de pointes is related to the extent of QTc prolongation, concurrent use of QTc prolonging medications, a history of torsade des pointes, preexisting QTc interval prolongation, heart failure, concurrent potassium-wasting diuretics, or other conditions associated with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. The risk may be increased when arsenic trioxide is coadministered with medications associated with electrolyte abnormalities (eg, diuretics, amphotericin B).\n【79】 • Differentiation syndrome: Patients with APL treated with arsenic trioxide have experienced differentiation syndrome (may be life threatening or fatal). Signs and symptoms may include fever (unexplained), dyspnea, acute respiratory distress, hypoxia, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural or pericardial effusions, weight gain or peripheral edema, hypotension, renal insufficiency, hepatopathy, or multiorgan dysfunction, occurring with or without leukocytosis. The onset of differentiation syndrome has occurred as early as day 1 of induction to as late as the second month of induction therapy. Prophylaxis with prednisone is recommended during induction cycle when arsenic trioxide is used in combination with tretinoin.\n【80】 • Encephalopathy: Serious encephalopathy, including Wernicke, has been reported with use.\n【81】 • Hepatotoxicity: In newly diagnosed low-risk APL studies, almost half of the patients treated with arsenic trioxide in combination with tretinoin experienced elevated AST, alkaline phosphatase, and/or serum bilirubin, which usually resolved with temporary discontinuation of arsenic trioxide and/or tretinoin. Long-term hepatic abnormalities may occur in patients with APL treated with arsenic trioxide in combination with tretinoin. Mild hepatic dysfunction and hepatic steatosis have been observed at a median of 7 years (range: up to 14 years) following arsenic trioxide and tretinoin combination therapy.\n【82】 • Secondary malignancy: Arsenic trioxide is a human carcinogen.\n【83】 • Multiple concentrations: Arsenic trioxide is available in different concentrations; verify concentration prior to admixture to assure appropriate dose preparation.\n【84】 Dosage Forms: US\n【85】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【86】 Solution, Intravenous:\n【87】 Generic: 10 mg/10 mL (10 mL); 12 mg/6 mL (6 mL)\n【88】 Solution, Intravenous [preservative free]:\n【89】 Trisenox: 12 mg/6 mL (6 mL)\n【90】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【91】 Yes\n【92】 Pricing: US\n【93】 10 mg/10 mL (per mL): $17.52 - $71.28\n【94】 12 mg/6 mL (per mL): $95.60 - $107.78\n【95】 12 mg/6 mL (per mL): $213.28\n【96】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【97】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【235】 Reproductive Considerations\n【236】 Females should be advised against conceiving during treatment with arsenic trioxide (Sanz 2019). Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating therapy. Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the final arsenic trioxide dose. Males with female partners of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months after the final arsenic trioxide dose.\n【237】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【238】 Arsenic trioxide crosses the placenta (Concha 1998).\n【239】 Based on the mechanism of action and findings in animal reproduction studies, arsenic trioxide may cause fetal harm if administered during pregnancy.\n【240】 Arsenic trioxide occurs naturally and toxicity varies between organic and inorganic forms (IOM 2000). In studies of women exposed to high levels of arsenic from drinking water, cord blood levels were similar to maternal serum levels. Dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) was the form of arsenic found in the fetus. An increased risk of low birth weight and still births were observed in women who ingested high levels of dietary arsenic (Concha 1998; von Ehrenstein 2006; Yang 2003).\n【241】 Available leukemia guidelines note arsenic trioxide is teratogenic and should not be used at any time during pregnancy (Lishner 2016; Sanz 2019).\n【242】 Monitoring Parameters\n【243】 Monitor electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium), CBC with differential, renal function (serum creatinine), hepatic function (including total bilirubin, AST, alkaline phosphatase), blood glucose, and coagulation parameters: Baseline, then at least 2 to 3 times a week during induction and at least weekly during consolidation; more frequent monitoring may be necessary in unstable patients. Consider testing thiamine levels in patients at risk for thiamine deficiency. Pregnancy test. ECG 12-lead (baseline then weekly, monitor more frequently in clinically unstable patients and in patients with concomitant medications associated with QTc prolongation that could not be discontinued). Monitor for signs/symptoms of acute promyelocytic leukemia differentiation syndrome (unexplained fever, dyspnea and/or weight gain, abnormal chest auscultatory findings or radiographic abnormalities). Monitor for the development of second primary malignancies.\n【244】 The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion (ASCO [Hwang 2020]) recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.\n【245】 Mechanism of Action\n【246】 Arsenic trioxide induces apoptosis in APL cells via morphological changes and DNA fragmentation; also damages or degrades the fusion protein promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-retinoic acid receptor (RAR) alpha\n【247】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【248】 Distribution: Vdss: Arsenious acid (AsIII): 562 L; widely distributed throughout body tissues; dependent on body weight and increases as body weight increases; orally administered arsenic trioxide distributes into the CNS\n【249】 Metabolism: Arsenic trioxide is immediately hydrolyzed to the active form, arsenious acid (AsIII) which is methylated (hepatically) to the less active pentavalent metabolites, monomethylarsonic acid (MMAv) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMAv) by methyltransferases; AsIII is also oxidized to the minor metabolite, arsenic acid (Asv)\n【250】 Half-life elimination: AsIII: 10 to 14 hours; MMAv: ~32 hours; DMAv: ~72 hours\n【251】 Time to peak: AsIII: At the end of infusion (2 hours); MMAv and DMAv; ~10 to 24 hours\n【252】 Excretion: Urine (MMAv, DMAv, and ~15% of a dose as unchanged AsIII)\n【253】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【254】 Altered kidney function: Results from a pharmacokinetic study in patients with advanced malignancies showed that mean AUC for AsIII was ~48% higher in patients with several renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/minute) than in patients with normal renal function (CrCl >80 mL/minute). Systemic exposure to metabolites MMAV and DMAV may also be increased in patients with renal impairment.\n【255】 Hepatic function impairment: A small pharmacokinetic study in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma showed that the mean dose-normalized AUC and Cmax values were 40% and 70% higher, respectively, in a patient with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) versus patients with normal hepatic function. Additionally, the mean dose-normalized trough plasma levels for metabolites MMAV and DMAV were 2.2-fold and 4.7-fold higher, respectively, than levels in patients with normal hepatic function.\n【256】 Brand Names: International\n【257】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Arsenic trioxide  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/arsenic-trioxide-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E6%B9%BF%E6%80%A7%E8%84%9A%E6%B0%94%E7%97%85&source=search_result&selectedTitle=65%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

Alternative antimicrobial agents should be considered, but if a concurrent carbapenem is necessary, consider additional anti-seizure medication. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【71】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【72】 Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this combination; adverse events were observed in animal reproduction studies following administration of the vaborbactam component.\n【73】 Also refer to the meropenem monograph for additional information.\n【74】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【75】 Meropenem is present in breast milk; excretion of vaborbactam is not known. According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother\n【76】 Dietary Considerations\n【77】 Some products may contain sodium.\n【78】 Monitoring Parameters\n【79】 Monitor for signs of hypersensitivity reaction, including anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions. Periodically monitor renal function; in patients with changing renal function, monitor serum creatinine and eGFR at least daily.\n【80】 Mechanism of Action\n【81】 Meropenem: Inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis by binding to penicillin-binding proteins, which in turn inhibit the final transpeptidation step of peptidoglycan synthesis in bacterial cell walls, thus inhibiting cell wall biosynthesis; bacteria eventually lyse due to ongoing activity of cell wall autolytic enzymes (autolysins and murein hydrolases) while cell wall assembly is arrested\n【82】 Vaborbactam is a beta-lactamase inhibitor that protects meropenem from degradation by certain serine beta-lactamases (eg, K. pneumonia carbapenemase [KPC]). Vaborbactam does not have antibacterial activity.\n【83】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【84】 Distribution: Vd: Meropenem: 20.2 L; Vaborbactam: 18.6 L\n【85】 Protein binding: Meropenem: ~2%; Vaborbactam: ~33%\n【86】 Metabolism: Meropenem: Hydrolysis of beta-lactam bond to open lactam form (minor); Vaborbactam: Not metabolized\n【87】 Half-life elimination: Meropenem: 1.22 hours; Vaborbactam: 1.68 hours\n【88】 Excretion: Meropenem: Urine (40% to 60% [unchanged]; 22% inactive hydrolysis product); feces (~2%); Vaborbactam: Urine (75% to 95% [unchanged])\n【89】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【90】 Altered kidney function: Meropenem AUC ratios to subjects with normal renal function are 1.28, 2.07, and 4.63 for subjects with mild (eGFR 60 to 89 mL/minute/1.73 m2), moderate (eGFR 30 to 59 mL/minute/1.73 m2), and severe (eGFR <30 mL/minute/1.73 m2) renal impairment, respectively.

Men are sometimes reluctant to bring incontinence to the attention of their clinician. Only one in five men with symptoms is likely to seek care, and men are only half as likely as women to seek care (22 versus 45 percent, respectively), despite the availability of many types of treatments [1,2].\n【2】 Urinary incontinence can limit participation in activities and lower quality of life. Men with urinary incontinence have a higher rate of depression and are more likely to decrease participation in activities (eg, decrease work hours, change employment, or take voluntary early retirement) [3]. Some evidence suggests that urinary incontinence may have a greater emotional and social impact on quality of life for men than for women [1,2,4].\n【3】 Men are more likely to experience urinary incontinence as they get older [5,6]. In a study among community-dwelling men, the prevalence of at least one urinary incontinence episode in the preceding 12 months increased from almost 5 percent at ages 19 to 44 years, to 11.2 percent at ages 45 to 64 years, to 21 percent in men older than 65 years [7]. In other studies, the prevalence of urinary incontinence in men older than 65 years ranged from 11 to 34 percent, with a prevalence of daily incontinence of 2 to 11 percent [5,8-10]. The prevalence in men living in nursing homes is higher compared with those in community settings and men with urinary incontinence have a higher risk of institutionalization [1,2,11,12].\n【4】 This topic will discuss the epidemiology, causes, classification, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of urinary incontinence in men [13].\n【5】 Urinary incontinence in women is discussed separately. (See  \"Female urinary incontinence: Evaluation\" and  \"Female urinary incontinence: Treatment\".)\n【6】 CAUSES/CLASSIFICATIONS OF INCONTINENCE — Types of male urinary incontinence differ in their etiologies, clinical manifestations, and treatments.\n【7】 A patient may have more than one type of urinary incontinence. The etiology of each type of incontinence may be multifactorial with a variety of contributing pathophysiologic mechanisms.\n【8】 Urge urinary incontinence — Urge urinary incontinence (UUI), the most common type of incontinence among men, manifests as a sudden and compelling desire to pass urine that is difficult to defer and is accompanied by involuntary leakage.\n【9】 UUI is typically associated with either bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) or overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome, also called detrusor overactivity, causing urinary urgency and frequency.\n【10】 UUI is one of the components that may be seen with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men. The etiologies of LUTS are discussed in detail separately. (See  \"Lower urinary tract symptoms in males\", section on 'Etiologies of LUTS'.)\n【11】 Causes of BOO or overactive bladder include:\n【12】 ●Benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH)\n【13】 ●Neurologic conditions affecting the brain (stroke, normal pressure hydrocephalus) that can also cause UUI (see 'Patients with neurologic disease' below)\n【14】 ●Medications that can increase bladder contractility or exacerbate obstructive effects (table 1)\n【15】 Although the specific mechanisms that cause UUI are poorly understood, UUI is partly related to uninhibited bladder contractions. These contractions may be due to a defect in afferent sensory signaling from the urinary tract or central processing of these signals, and/or due to detrusor muscle dysfunction (figure 1).\n【16】 Stress urinary incontinence — Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) occurs in the absence of a bladder contraction and is due to inadequate urethral sphincter function, either from mechanical damage to the urethral sphincter or from physiologic effects that limit sphincter function.\n【17】 Causes of SUI include:\n【18】 ●Prostate surgery – Prostate surgery is the most common cause of SUI.\n【19】 •Radical prostatectomy to treat prostate cancer can result in damage to the external urethral sphincter during surgical dissection because the sphincter is closely approximated to the prostatic apex (figure 2).\n【20】 Following radical prostatectomy, it is common for men to initially experience SUI; however, this typically improves or resolves over 6 to 12 months [14-17]. Up to 40 percent of men report some degree of long-term urinary incontinence after radical prostatectomy, but for the majority of men, symptoms are mild and do not require treatment [18]. The rate of persistent, bothersome urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy is approximately 5 to 10 percent [18-22]. (See  \"Radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer\", section on 'Surgical treatment'.)\n【21】 •Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) for benign prostatic enlargement to remove obstructing prostate tissue can cause damage to the external urethral sphincter (especially as a result of multiple such resections), but that is uncommon. (See  \"Surgical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)\".)\n【22】 ●Spinal cord injury or disease that impairs sphincter function. This is described separately, (See  \"Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders\", section on 'Autonomic fibers' and  \"Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease\", section on 'Bladder dysfunction'.)\n【23】 ●Medications that impair sphincter function (table 1).\n【24】 Mixed incontinence — Mixed incontinence, a combination of SUI and UUI, is not common among men. It may be seen when both the bladder and urinary sphincter have impaired function, such as in patients with neurologic disorders (eg, spina bifida, spinal cord injury) or sometimes after prostate surgery or radiation. Additionally, mixed urinary incontinence may occur when a patient with either UUI or SUI that has been stable for years has a new causative factor or medication that causes the other type of incontinence to occur.\n【25】 Overflow incontinence — Overflow incontinence occurs when urine is retained in the bladder due to incomplete emptying after an attempt to urinate. Overflow incontinence is one of the less common causes of incontinence; however, identifying it early on leads to the recognition of associated urinary retention that may result in damage to the bladder and kidneys [23].\n【26】 The retention of urine leading to overflow incontinence can be due to BOO or detrusor underactivity, also known as impaired detrusor contractility or underactive bladder.\n【27】 Causes of BOO or detrusor underactivity include:\n【28】 ●BPH\n【29】 ●Urethral stricture disease\n【30】 ●Neurologic disorders (see 'Patients with neurologic disease' below):\n【31】 •Neuropathy and lower spinal cord (cauda equina) pathology can cause detrusor underactivity\n【32】 •Higher spinal cord lesions can cause sphincter hyperactivity and outflow obstruction\n【33】 ●Medications that can decrease bladder contractility/cause detrusor underactivity (table 1)\n【34】 ●Postoperative urinary retention (may be occult) (see  \"Overview of post-anesthetic care for adult patients\", section on 'Inability to void')\n【35】 Acute urinary retention is described separately. (See  \"Acute urinary retention\", section on 'Pathogenesis and etiologies'.)\n【36】 Post-void dribbling — Post-void dribbling (PVD) is dribbling of urine retained in the urethra after the bladder has emptied. It causes wetness soon after the patient has completed urinating but not at other times.\n【37】 PVD may occur along with other LUTS and be caused by factors that cause LUTS; it also occurs independently of LUTS. As an isolated symptom, PVD is most commonly idiopathic, although rarely it is due to a urethral stricture or diverticulum or to hypospadias.\n【38】 Functional incontinence — Functional incontinence occurs when comorbid physical conditions impair the patient’s mobility so that a patient cannot get to a bathroom in time, thus is incontinent of urine. The impaired mobility may be temporary (eg, an injury limiting ambulation) or permanent [7,24,25]. Typically a patient can indicate if limited mobility is the reason for his incontinence, unless the patient has cognitive impairment (eg, dementia).\n【39】 Incontinence after prostate treatment — Urinary incontinence after prostate treatment (including radical prostatectomy) is discussed elsewhere. (See  \"Urinary incontinence after prostate treatment\".)\n【40】 INITIAL EVALUATION\n【41】 History and examination — A focused history is often sufficient to identify the most probable type of urinary incontinence. Symptoms occurring with urination help to narrow the differential diagnosis and focus the examination.\n【42】 Certain antecedent or comorbid conditions help to guide the determination of the type of incontinence, including recent prostate surgery, medication changes, and comorbid neurologic disease. (See 'Further evaluation and diagnosis' below.)\n【43】 Patients should be asked if they have these symptoms suggesting a specific type of incontinence:\n【44】 ●Urge urinary incontinence (UUI) – A sense of urgency; precipitants such as running water or hand-washing or exposure to a cold environment; along with hesitancy, straining to void, and an intermittent or slow stream\n【45】 ●Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) – Incontinence with physical exertion, coughing, sneezing, laughing, or lifting or with gravitational change (arising from bed)\n【46】 ●Overflow incontinence – A sense of incomplete emptying, pelvic discomfort, bedwetting\n【47】 ●Post-void dribbling (PVD) – Incontinence that is limited to the postvoid setting and without symptoms of UUI\n【48】 ●Urinary tract infection (UTI) – Burning, frequency, and/or fever\n【49】 ●Constipation that could contribute or be comorbid with urinary incontinence\n【50】 Questionnaires can facilitate gathering information to determine the type of incontinence. A table of typical responses to a questionnaire to distinguish between the two most common causes of incontinence, SUI and UUI, is shown in a form (form 1).\n【51】 A number of other self-assessment instruments can be used as part of the initial evaluation of a patient with urinary incontinence to assess precipitants/associated symptoms, severity, and the bother of incontinence. These tools may also be used to monitor treatment effectiveness [26]. (See 'Tools to measure treatment effectiveness' below.)\n【52】 Components of physical examination to evaluate urinary incontinence include:\n【53】 ●Rectal examination to assess prostate size and consistency for a gross estimate of the degree of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) that could cause bladder outlet obstruction (BOO).\n【54】 ●Abdominal examination after voiding to:\n【55】 •Assess for a palpable bladder that may be present with incomplete emptying\n【56】 •Assess for an abdominal mass that could cause pressure on the bladder\n【57】 We use the same indications for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing for men with incontinence as for asymptomatic men, although some clinicians may consider testing at a somewhat younger age. Benefits and risks of PSA testing should be discussed (see  \"Screening for prostate cancer\", section on 'Approach to screening'). In a man with incontinence, PSA may help to identify benign prostatic enlargement or prostate cancer that could affect treatment and can serve as a baseline PSA for a patient who will take a medication that alters PSA (eg, an alpha reductase inhibitor). (See  \"Lower urinary tract symptoms in males\", section on 'History, physical, and testing'.)\n【58】 Identifying urgent or reversible causes — Information gathered during focused history and examination is used to determine if there is an urgent concern (eg, overflow incontinence due to urinary retention that needs immediate treatment to relieve bladder pressure) or a potentially reversible cause that should be identified and addressed [27].\n【59】 Urinary retention — A patient with overflow incontinence due to urinary retention may describe a sensation of incomplete emptying (eg, bladder feeling full despite having just voided or passing urine right after having just voided). Sometimes, there may be nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) due to pelvic floor relaxation at night combined with a very full bladder, or UTIs (due to bacteria retained in the bladder with the urine). Some men with slowly progressive urinary retention may have minimal symptoms. These patients may report increased abdominal girth (due to the distended bladder), or vague abdominal discomfort.\n【60】 Examination findings may include a palpable bladder on abdominal examination right after voiding and/or an enlarged prostate that could cause BOO.\n【61】 Post-void residual (PVR) should be measured if poor bladder emptying is suspected. Ultrasound measurement is preferred over urinary catheterization, which is more uncomfortable and carries a risk of infection or urethral trauma. (See  \"Acute urinary retention\", section on 'Diagnosis'.)\n【62】 PVR ≥200 mL suggests overflow incontinence; a patient whose PVR is <200 mL does not have overflow incontinence [28]. If the PVR is >300 mL, a catheter should be placed right away so that the bladder and kidneys are not at risk of damage due to excessive urinary volume. In addition, a serum creatinine and renal ultrasound should be obtained and a referral to urology placed. Specifics are described separately. (See  \"Acute urinary retention\", section on 'Acute management'.)\n【63】 After relieving the urinary retention, any causes contributing to urinary retention should be addressed (eg, eliminating or decreasing dosages of medications (table 1) that can cause detrusor underactivity or sphincter dysfunction, or relieving constipation that can cause obstruction). If there is BOO due to BPH, this should be addressed as described separately. (See  \"Medical treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia\".)\n【64】 Urinalysis — A urinalysis should be obtained to assess for irritants (eg, infection or blood) in the bladder. If bladder infection is suspected (eg, due to fever, dysuria), a urine culture should also be obtained.\n【65】 ●Infection – If a UTI is detected by urine testing, it should be treated. (See  \"Acute simple cystitis in adult males\", section on 'Treatment'.)\n【66】 If incontinence persists, eradication of the UTI should be confirmed; after eradication of the UTI, evaluation for other types of incontinence should be done.\n【67】 ●Blood – If urinalysis reveals hematuria, further evaluation should be done. This is described separately. (See  \"Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults\".)\n【68】 If incontinence persists after hematuria is addressed, evaluation for other types of incontinence should be done.\n【69】 Causative medications — If a patient taking a potentially causative medication (table 1) is experiencing incontinence, the medication should be discontinued or decreased if possible, even if the patient has taken the medication for years before the onset of incontinence. Relieving any contribution that a medication is making may alleviate the incontinence even if there are many contributing factors.\n【70】 Functional limitations — A patient who describes being incontinent due to difficulty getting to a toilet in a timely way because of limited functional mobility is experiencing functional incontinence. The onset may be abrupt (eg, an injury to a leg temporarily preventing walking) or more gradual (eg, inability to ambulate far enough to reach a bathroom due to worsening arthritis). The patient can typically describe a temporal relationship between declining mobility and onset of incontinence, although a patient with cognitive impairment may not give this history.\n【71】 Functional incontinence may be addressed by providing alternative receptacles or planning to void without waiting for the bladder to be as full. Acceptable alternatives may include a male urinal, commode, or condom catheter. For men who need more time to access the bathroom, timed voiding (planned visits to the bathroom) prior to a definite need to urinate may address functional incontinence. For patients with a functional limitation due to cognitive impairment/dementia, reminders to void regularly (queueing) may be beneficial.\n【72】 Other reversible causes\n【73】 ●Caffeine and alcohol consumption – If a patient notes that intake of caffeine or alcohol is temporally associated with incontinence, these should be eliminated from the patient’s diet; or, a trial of abstinence can be attempted regardless of an obvious temporal association.\n【74】 ●Constipation – If the patient describes constipation or stool impaction is detected on rectal examination, constipation should be treated, as it may be contributing to incontinence. (See  \"Management of chronic constipation in adults\".)\n【75】 ●Obesity – Pressure from the weight of the abdomen may press on the bladder, leading to SUI that may resolve with weight reduction. (See  \"Obesity in adults: Overview of management\", section on 'Approach to therapy'.)\n【76】 If intercurrent treatment is needed while pursuing weight loss, approaches to treating SUI may be used. (See 'Stress urinary incontinence' below.)\n【77】 Indications for referral — Men who have symptoms, signs, or past history suggesting \"complicated\" incontinence should be referred to a specialist in urology prior to attempting therapy for the incontinence. These include:\n【78】 ●Concern for a urologic cancer (eg, hematuria, prostate nodule, induration, or asymmetry, or elevated PSA)\n【79】 ●Prior pelvic surgery/invasive procedure or radiation of the prostate or urethra\n【80】 ●PVR >300 mL (see  \"Acute urinary retention\", section on 'Acute management')\n【81】 ●Neurologic disease (see 'Patients with neurologic disease' below)\n【82】 ●Recurrent bladder or prostate infections\n【83】 ●Pelvic pain\n【84】 ●Severe incontinence requiring multiple heavy pads or incontinence briefs each day\n【85】 FURTHER EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS — After identifying and addressing urgent or reversible causes including overflow incontinence and functional incontinence, history and findings can be used to determine other causes of incontinence. The temporal relationship between a potentially causative event (eg, prostate surgery associated with stress urinary incontinence [SUI]) and the presence of certain associated symptoms often suggest a particular type of incontinence (eg, SUI, urge urinary incontinence [UUI], mixed, or post-void dribbling [PVD]) that is confirmed by additional symptoms and findings on history and examination. (See 'History and examination' above.)\n【86】 After prostate surgery, radiation, or urethral trauma — Patients with incontinence that occurs after prostate surgery, radiation, or urethral trauma may have had damage to the urethral sphincter that can produce SUI. These patients are typically evaluated and managed by their urologist. (See  \"Radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer\", section on 'Urinary incontinence'.)\n【87】 Patients with SUI describe incontinence with exertion that increases intraabdominal pressure (eg, physical activity, coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting) because the increase in intraabdominal pressure can increase pressure on the bladder that the malfunctioning sphincter cannot withstand, resulting in urinary incontinence.\n【88】 Most men with SUI will report that they are dry when lying down, because there is not a gravitational effect causing leakage if their sphincter relaxes. Continuous leakage with standing up against gravity is called gravitational SUI; this implies severe injury to the urethral sphincter.\n【89】 The management of postoperative SUI is described below. (See 'Stress urinary incontinence' below.)\n【90】 Patients with urgency — Patients with UUI typically feel a sense of urgency to urinate that may be brought on by precipitants such as running water, hand washing, or exposure to a cold environment. They may experience hesitancy, straining to void, a sensation of incomplete emptying, or an intermittent or slow stream. They may be on a medication (table 1) that was initiated or increased that could increase bladder contractility and cause overactive bladder (OAB). Examination may reveal an enlarged prostate consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). (See 'Urge urinary incontinence' above.)\n【91】 UUI is often associated with other urinary symptoms that may include frequency and nocturia. A combination of any of these symptoms is referred to as lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The evaluation of UUI and other LUTS is described separately. (See  \"Lower urinary tract symptoms in males\", section on 'Overactive bladder and detrusor overactivity'.)\n【92】 Patients with neurologic disease — Diseases of the brain or of the spine can cause urinary incontinence through effects on the bladder and/or the urinary sphincter.\n【93】 Patients with an underlying neurologic disease as the etiology for incontinence will have other neurologic signs or symptoms [29]. For most patients with a neurologic etiology for urinary incontinence, the neurologic diagnosis will already be established; it is unusual for urinary incontinence to be the presenting feature of a neurologic disorder.\n【94】 Brain diseases that can lead to incontinence, most commonly UUI, include:\n【95】 ●Parkinson disease – Etiologies and treatments are described separately. (See  \"Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease\", section on 'Autonomic dysfunction' and  \"Palliative approach to Parkinson disease and parkinsonian disorders\", section on 'Autonomic dysfunction'.)\n【96】 ●Stroke – Most commonly, detrusor hyperactivity is the cause of incontinence after stroke. Evaluation is described separately. (See  \"Complications of stroke: An overview\", section on 'Urinary incontinence'.)\n【97】 ●Normal pressure hydrocephalus – Specifics are discussed separately. (See  \"Normal pressure hydrocephalus\", section on 'Urinary incontinence'.)\n【98】 Spinal cord conditions cause incontinence through a variety of mechanisms, including SUI. In patients with neurologic disorders, SUI may occur with transfers (eg, from a wheelchair to bed) as these activities typically cause increased intraabdominal pressure. Spinal cord conditions that can lead to incontinence include traumatic injury. The evaluation and management of incontinence in this setting is described separately. (See  \"Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease\", section on 'Bladder dysfunction'.)\n【99】 Multiple sclerosis affects both the brain and spinal cord and can produce concurrent types of incontinence. Specifics related to the evaluation and management of incontinence in patients with multiple sclerosis is discussed separately. (See  \"Manifestations of multiple sclerosis in adults\", section on 'Bowel and bladder dysfunction' and  \"Symptom management of multiple sclerosis in adults\", section on 'Bladder dysfunction'.)\n【100】 Isolated post-void dribbling — A man who describes completing urination and then having some dribbling right after urination is experiencing PVD. PVD differs from a slow dribbling stream during urination that may occur due to BPH and may be accompanied by urinary hesitancy and other symptoms of UUI.\n【101】 A man with PVD may give a history of a procedure through the penis (eg, transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP] or cystoscopy) prior to the onset of the symptom, although the absence of such a procedure does not rule out the possibility of PVD; most patients with PVD do not have such a history.\n【102】 Hypospadias with a very proximal position of the urethral opening may be detected on examination of a patient with PVD. If the patient is uncircumcised or partially circumcised, the foreskin should be replaced in position after retracting it for the examination to avoid paraphimosis (retracted foreskin that cannot be returned to normal position). (See 'Post-void dribbling' above.)\n【103】 Other patients — Patients with either overflow incontinence or functional incontinence have typically been identified early on in the evaluation. (See 'Initial evaluation' above.)\n【104】 ●Mixed urgency and stress incontinence — A diagnosis of mixed incontinence is typically made by detecting symptoms of both SUI and UUI. Both types may develop at the same time; or, alternatively, a man may develop a second type of incontinence after he has controlled one type, and thus may describe incontinence as occurring at different times and with different activities than before. (See 'After prostate surgery, radiation, or urethral trauma' above and 'Patients with urgency' above.)\n【105】 MANAGEMENT\n【106】 Patient expectations of treatment — Regardless of the type of urinary incontinence, discussing the patient’s goals and expectations of treatment is key because a multicomponent approach focused on the aspects of urinary incontinence that are most bothersome to the patient is important for successful management. Treatment aimed at simply decreasing the number of incontinence episodes (the focus of the majority of treatment trials) may not be sufficient to improve the quality of life for patients most bothered by the timing, volume, or inconvenience of urinary incontinence. For example, for some men, a period of continence sufficient to complete a meeting, take a car ride, or attend a sporting event is a major goal, whereas for other men, avoiding side effects from medications or a surgical procedure is more important.\n【107】 Adjunctive measures — Men with any type of incontinence may be using adjunctive measures during evaluation and initiation of treatment. Men should be counseled that leakage is not a normal part of aging and that goals of treatment include minimizing or eliminating the need for the use of pads or catheters as a self-management strategy.\n【108】 Although some men may continue to use these measures over the long term as well, these should not be the only treatments, because chronic use is associated with risk. Adding treatments to correct the underlying cause(s) of incontinence may decrease the need for adjunctive measures and thus modulate the associated risks.\n【109】 Adjunctive measures include:\n【110】 ●Protective pads and undergarments – Protective pads and garments made of absorptive materials that collect expelled urine may be effective to limit visible aspects of incontinence (thus eliminating embarrassment); there are risks to chronic use.\n【111】 Chronic exposure to urine-soaked pads can result in contact dermatitis and skin breakdown that is uncomfortable and can predispose to infection. This risk may be mitigated by measures that minimize urinary leakage and by ensuring regular changes of pads or garments when leakage occurs. (See  \"Prevention of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury\", section on 'Minimize excess temperature and moisture'.)\n【112】 Information on pad varieties and other urinary incontinence supplies is available from medical supply companies and United States-based urinary incontinence patient advocacy groups, such as The Simon Foundation and the National Association for Continence.\n【113】 ●External catheters – External urinary catheters (also called condom catheters or sheath drainage systems) are associated with less morbidity compared with indwelling catheters [30]. Men may find them preferable to pads. Successful use of an external catheter requires adherence of the condom sheath to the penis. (See  \"Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults\", section on 'External'.)\n【114】 Use of external catheters may not be possible in some patients who are not able to keep catheters in place (eg, due to skin infections) or are not physically able to place catheters (eg, obesity, neurologic impairment).\n【115】 In men with bladder dysfunction who use an external catheter, urodynamic testing should be obtained to determine that bladder storage pressures remain low to avoid progressive renal damage. Other complications of these catheters are described separately. (See  \"Complications of urinary bladder catheters and preventive strategies\", section on 'External catheters'.)\n【116】 ●Penile clamps – Penile clamps can be used in men with stress urinary incontinence (SUI) who have adequate bladder storage function (ie, normal bladder capacity and normal compliance). These clamps can cause discomfort if used constantly, so many men find they work best for short-term use (eg, dinner, going to a movie, etc).\n【117】 ●Indwelling or intermittent catheters – Use of indwelling or intermittent catheters should be avoided whenever possible, because they place the patient at risk for complications. (See  \"Complications of urinary bladder catheters and preventive strategies\".)\n【118】 However, in certain limited instances of incontinence or associated conditions (eg, acute urinary retention), a bladder catheter is required. (See  \"Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults\".)\n【119】 Nonpharmacologic therapy — Nonpharmacologic therapies for urge urinary incontinence (UUI), SUI, and mixed incontinence include:\n【120】 ●Pelvic floor muscle exercises, which are done using the same techniques for men and for women (see  \"Patient education: Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Beyond the Basics)\")\n【121】 ●Lifestyle modification, particularly weight loss and fluid consumption (see  \"Female urinary incontinence: Treatment\", section on 'Lifestyle modification')\n【122】 ●Bladder training (table 2) (see  \"Female urinary incontinence: Treatment\", section on 'Bladder training')\n【123】 ●Biofeedback to supplement pelvic muscle exercises (see  \"Female urinary incontinence: Treatment\", section on 'Supplemental modalities')\n【124】 Managing specific types of incontinence\n【125】 Stress urinary incontinence — The management of SUI is typically coordinated by a urologist.\n【126】 ●Nonpharmacologic therapy – nonpharmacologic therapy is generally used for initial management of SUI along with adjunctive measures. (See 'Nonpharmacologic therapy' above and 'Adjunctive measures' above.)\n【127】 In systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized trials, results differ as to whether there is benefit of nonpharmacologic therapies (eg, pelvic floor muscle therapy/biofeedback either pre- or postoperatively) for postsurgical urinary incontinence [7,31]. As an example, trials of men with incontinence six weeks after radical prostatectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) detected no differences in frequency or volume of urinary incontinence between men who received one-to-one pelvic floor muscle training versus control [32]. In contrast, among men with incontinence for more than one year after radical prostatectomy, patients receiving eight weeks of either behavioral therapy alone (pelvic floor muscle training and bladder control strategies), or behavioral therapy plus biofeedback and pelvic floor electrical stimulation, had a 55 and 51 percent reduction, respectively, in the number of incontinence episodes compared with a 24 percent reduction in those assigned to observation [33].\n【128】 For some men with SUI, a penile clamp to mechanically hinder involuntary passage of urine may be used, although only intermittently [30]. A patient who uses a penile clamp should be ambulatory, have good bladder storage function, and be able to place and remove the clamp himself. Use of a penile clamp by a patient with sensory abnormalities should be avoided, because tissue damage from the clamp can occur with prolonged use, and a patient with sensory impairment may not recall that the clamp is in place or realize that it is causing damage.\n【129】 ●Pharmacotherapy for SUI – For men with SUI who do not respond to lifestyle interventions or pelvic floor muscle exercises after at least three months, we suggest the addition of duloxetine, a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI).\n【130】 •Duloxetine – Duloxetine, an SNRI, is approved for the treatment of SUI in many European countries. In the United States, there are no medications approved for SUI; duloxetine is approved to treat major depression and neuropathic pain.\n【131】 A systematic review found limited evidence to support the efficacy of any single medication for male urinary incontinence, and only one well-performed randomized trial [34]. In this trial of 112 men with postprostatectomy SUI, after 16-week follow-up those randomly assigned to duloxetine along with pelvic muscle exercises were more likely to report improved incontinence-related quality of life compared with those assigned to pelvic muscle exercises alone, and 39 (versus 27) patients were dry [35]. This beneficial effect of duloxetine quickly disappeared after discontinuation. Patients were more likely to discontinue duloxetine compared with placebo (15 versus 2 percent) during the study period, with nausea being the most commonly cited reason [35].\n【132】 ●Procedural and surgical interventions for SUI – The most common interventions for male SUI are transurethral bulking agents, perineal slings, and the artificial urinary sphincter. For men experiencing incontinence following radical prostatectomy, watchful waiting supplemented with nonpharmacologic therapy for a period of at least 6 to 12 months is generally recommended to allow for spontaneous resolution of SUI symptoms [36,37].\n【133】 Selecting among these therapies depends upon the severity of the incontinence and whether the patient is healthy enough to undergo one of the surgical procedures, which have greater efficacy than the transurethral bulking agent procedure. For men who choose to have surgery for SUI, the main treatment decision is between surgical placement of a perineal sling and an artificial urinary sphincter. The choice is based on patient preference; data suggest that most men prefer a sling [38]. These therapies may be trialed sequentially, as a single prior injection of bulking agents does not appear to affect the postoperative results of male perineal slings [39] or artificial urinary sphincters [40], and previous sling placement does not appear to adversely affect the outcome of artificial urinary sphincter placement [41].\n【134】 •Transurethral bulking agents – Various substances can be injected into the submucosal tissues of the urethra or bladder neck to improve SUI symptoms.\n【135】 For select men with mild SUI or those who are not candidates for more invasive surgery, transurethral bulking agents may be a reasonable treatment option. The success rates in men are lower (<25 percent) than those reported in women, presumably due to increased scarring at the bladder neck following prostate surgery. In men, multiple injections (up to four) are usually required to achieve satisfactory results, which generally last one year or less, at which point an additional injection is required [42]. However, repeated injections of bulking agents may make other subsequent surgery more difficult.\n【136】 •Perineal sling – Sling techniques involving urethral repositioning have been adapted for use in men. The slings typically use synthetic mesh to mobilize and compress the urethra, likely by extending the functional length of the membranous urethra, to achieve continence. Contemporary male slings are placed transversely through the obturator foramen [43-45]. Additionally, a “quadratic” sling is available that combines transobturator fixation with an anterior prepubic component [46].\n【137】 Slings may be preferred in men with limited manual dexterity who may have difficulty manipulating an artificial urinary sphincter or in those with more mild incontinence [47,48].\n【138】 Studies of perineal sling placement for incontinence occurring after prostate surgery showed evidence of efficacy; however, long-term data are limited. In a prospective study of 44 patients at median follow-up of two years, 55 percent had no wet pads and another 23 percent reduced the number of pads used by >50 percent. Failure rate was 23 percent within six months; failure was associated with body mass index (BMI) of ≥30, prior irradiation, and prior high-intensity focused ultrasound. A retrospective study found similar results. Postoperative complications, including urinary retention, infections, and urethral erosion, occurred in 14 percent of patients and necessitated sling removal in 9 percent. The International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) and the United Kingdom National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have concluded that evidence supports the safety and efficacy of male slings for postprostatectomy SUI [36,49-51].\n【139】 •Artificial urinary sphincter – The artificial urinary sphincter is the most effective long-term treatment for men with severe SUI or with previous pelvic radiation therapy [52].\n【140】 The artificial urinary sphincter consists of three silicone components: a cuff, a balloon reservoir, and a pump. Each of these components is attached to a length of silicone tubing and connected together during the surgical implant procedure.\n【141】 Success rates (use of ≤1 pad daily) have ranged from 59 to 90 percent at follow-up intervals ranging from one to eight years [36]. Patient satisfaction with this technique is high, even among men with severe SUI [53-55].\n【142】 However, surgical revision of the artificial urinary sphincter is often required to maintain long-term continence. Surgical revision may be needed due to urethral erosion, infection, mechanical malfunction of the device (eg, leaking of fluid), or urethral atrophy. A common cause of late urethral erosion is Foley catheter trauma. Therefore, after artificial urinary sphincter placement, it is vital that urethral instrumentation be kept to a minimum, as such instrumentation may weaken the urethra at the cuff site and cause erosion of the cuff. If urethral catheterization is required, the artificial urinary sphincter must be deactivated and the smallest catheter possible (usually 12 French) should be utilized for not more than 48 hours preferably. Deactivation often requires involvement of a urologist, although teaching the patient to deactivate the device may allow the patient to take responsibility for deactivating it prior to Foley catheter placement. If urethral erosion occurs, the cuff must be surgically removed and a Foley catheter placed for a period of two weeks to allow the urethra to heal. Another cuff may then be placed at a later time. There is a risk of subsequent urethral stricture in the setting urethral erosion.\n【143】 Another cause of artificial urinary sphincter failure is postoperative wound infection, which occurs in <3 percent of patients [56] and typically requires removal of the entire device. Artificial urinary sphincters are more likely to fail in patients with compromised urethras (from prior artificial urinary sphincter placement, radiation therapy, or urethroplasty) [57].\n【144】 Urge urinary incontinence — For men with UUI, nonpharmacologic therapy (see 'Nonpharmacologic therapy' above) is typically used for initial management along with adjunctive measures. If symptoms persist, pharmacotherapy is added, and procedural or surgical treatment is an option for significant incontinence refractory to pharmacotherapy.\n【145】 These treatments for UUI are described in detail separately. (See  \"Lower urinary tract symptoms in males\".)\n【146】 Mixed incontinence — In men with mixed incontinence, a combination of therapies for UUI and SUI is indicated. Treatment should be individualized according to the etiologies and the relative severity of the UUI versus the SUI.\n【147】 Generally, the type of incontinence that started more recently is treated first, followed by symptom reassessment. A urologist may obtain urodynamic testing to aid in management decisions, particularly in men with prior pelvic radiation or those with neurologic disorders, as these conditions may reduce bladder storage capacity, resulting in chronically elevated bladder pressures that can lead to upper urinary tract damage over time. (See 'Indications for referral' above.)\n【148】 Post-void dribbling — A man with retained urine in the urethra causing post-void dribbling (PVD) should be advised to avoid compressing the urethra during voiding, such as from undergarments or pants.\n【149】 Following micturition, the patient should manually \"milk\" the perineal urethra to expel retained urine. Pelvic floor exercises may also be used. However, there is no direct evidence of efficacy with these interventions.\n【150】 Tools to measure treatment effectiveness — Self-assessment instruments for urinary incontinence may be used to measure patient-reported outcomes (PROMS). Additionally, comparing results during or after treatment with those obtained during initial evaluation of incontinence may help the patient and clinician assess treatment effectiveness [26].\n【151】 Self-assessment instruments include:\n【152】 ●To assess precipitants/associated symptoms, severity, and bother of incontinence:\n【153】 •Michigan Incontinence Symptom Index (M-ISI) – This self-scoring form is useful for patients with symptoms of SUI, UUI, or mixed incontinence. Questions cover the frequency of urinary incontinence with various activities, how many pads are used, and how much interference with daily activities and social embarrassment the incontinence causes [58].\n【154】 •International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-UI Short Form M) – The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form provides brief questions about the occurrence and severity of incontinence by asking about incontinence frequency, volume, precipitants, and how much it interferes with daily life. A long form is also available, as are forms to evaluate other urinary symptoms the patient may be experiencing.\n【155】 ●To assess severity:\n【156】 •Sandvik questionnaire – The Sandvik questionnaire can be used to assess how often leakage occurs and the approximate amount [59]:\n【157】 •24-hour pad weight – The weight of incontinence pads used over a 24-hour period provides a quantitative assessment of the degree of incontinence the man is experiencing. It can also help to determine the impact of a treatment regimen to help guide management decisions. As an example, if a medication measurably reduces the volume of urinary incontinence, dose titration may be reasonable, rather than discontinuing the medication for lack of efficacy. (See  \"Female urinary incontinence: Evaluation\", section on 'History'.)\n【158】 •Bladder diary – A three-day bladder diary can be used to document the frequency of urinary incontinence episodes (form 2). This can also help quantify the severity of urinary incontinence if the history obtained is unclear.\n【159】 SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  \"Society guideline links: Urinary incontinence in adults\".)\n【160】 INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, \"The Basics\" and \"Beyond the Basics.\" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【161】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on \"patient info\" and the keyword(s) of interest.)\n【162】 ●Basics topics (see  \"Patient education: Urinary incontinence in males (The Basics)\" and  \"Patient education: Neurogenic bladder in adults (The Basics)\" and  \"Patient education: Pelvic floor muscle exercises (The Basics)\")\n【163】 ●Beyond the Basics topics (see  \"Patient education: Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Beyond the Basics)\")\n【164】 SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n【165】 ●Classification – Types of male urinary incontinence include urge urinary incontinence (UUI), stress urinary incontinence (SUI), mixed urinary incontinence that includes UUI and SUI, overflow incontinence, post-void dribbling (PVD), and functional incontinence. A patient may have more than one type of urinary incontinence. The etiology of each type of incontinence may be multifactorial with a variety of contributing pathophysiologic mechanisms. (See 'Causes/classifications of incontinence' above.)\n【166】 ●History and examination – A focused history is often sufficient to identify the most probable type of urinary incontinence. Symptoms occurring with urination also help to narrow the differential diagnosis and focus the examination. Recent prostate surgery, medication changes, and comorbid neurologic disease are particularly relevant factors for determining the type of incontinence. (See 'History and examination' above.)\n【167】 ●Identifying urgent or reversible causes – In the initial evaluation, information gathered during history and examination determines if there is an urgent concern (eg, urinary retention) or a potentially reversible cause (eg, infection, medications (table 1), and others) that should be identified and addressed. (See 'Identifying urgent or reversible causes' above.)\n【168】 •Indications for referral – Men who should be referred to an urologist include those with concern for a urologic cancer, prior prostate or other pelvic surgery, radiation, post-void residual (PVR) >200 mL, neurologic disease, recurrent urologic infections, pelvic pain, or severe incontinence with multiple pads or incontinence briefs daily. (See 'Indications for referral' above.)\n【169】 ●Further evaluation and diagnosis – Further evaluation and diagnosis of the type of incontinence is based on the medical history and specific symptoms. This in turn will direct the most appropriate management. (See 'Further evaluation and diagnosis' above.)\n【170】 •A sense of urgency to urinate typically indicates UUI, which may be accompanied by other symptoms. (See 'Patients with urgency' above.)\n【171】 The evaluation and treatment of UUI is discussed separately. (See  \"Lower urinary tract symptoms in males\".)\n【172】 •Prostate surgery, radiation, or urethral trauma can damage the urethral sphincter and produce SUI. Symptoms of SUI include incontinence with exertion and, in severe cases, gravitation incontinence. (See 'After prostate surgery, radiation, or urethral trauma' above.)\n【173】 Men with SUI are typically evaluated and managed by their urologist. The patients are typically treated with lifestyle interventions or pelvic floor muscle exercises; duloxetine may be added if incontinence persists. Invasive treatments are reserved for men with SUI who do not respond to medical management. (See 'Stress urinary incontinence' above.)\n【174】 •Neurologic disease of the brain or spinal cord can cause urinary incontinence due to effects on the bladder and/or the urinary sphincter. (See 'Patients with neurologic disease' above.)\n【175】 •Dribbling after completing urination (PVD) as an isolated symptom is usually idiopathic; patients can be instructed to manually \"milk\" the perineal urethra to expel retained urine. Pelvic floor exercises may also be used. (See 'Isolated post-void dribbling' above and 'Post-void dribbling' above.)\n【176】 ●Management – Management strategies differ based on the type of incontinence. (See 'Managing specific types of incontinence' above.)\n【177】 ●Nonpharmacologic therapy – Nonpharmacologic therapies that may be used include pelvic floor muscle exercises; lifestyle modification, particularly weight loss and fluid consumption; bladder training (table 2); and biofeedback to supplement pelvic muscle exercises. (See 'Nonpharmacologic therapy' above.)\n【178】 ●Adjunctive measures – Men with incontinence may be using adjunctive measures (eg, pads or catheters) and should be counseled that leakage is not a normal part of aging and that goals of treatment include minimizing or eliminating the need for pads or catheters due to the risks of complications associated with their use. (See 'Adjunctive measures' above.)\n【179】 ●Tools to measure effectiveness – Several instruments are available for initial evaluation and to assess effectiveness of treatment of incontinence.

In United States intensive care units, over 5 million central venous catheters are inserted annually for rapid intravenous access and resuscitation [1,2]. Over 200,000 patients annually are identified who require permanent pacemaker placement, and increasing numbers of cardiac ablations have been performed over time [3,4]. In addition, over 80 percent of new hemodialysis patients are initiated with hemodialysis catheters, despite guidelines recommending early planning for arteriovenous access to minimize catheter use [5,6].\n【2】 Central venous access complications significantly increase length of stay and health care costs and negatively impact quality-of-life. Many complications are preventable with improved training and meticulous technique, and growing awareness of these issues has led to even greater emphasis on addressing these deficiencies.\n【3】 Central venous access may be achieved from several access sites. The most frequently accessed sites are the internal jugular, subclavian, and femoral veins. For many years, these veins were accessed using familiarity with nearby anatomic structures (ie, landmark techniques) (table 1). However, this approach fails to account for body habitus, anatomic variations, or pathology in patients, possibly leading to higher complication rates even in well-versed hands [7]. As an example, the internal jugular veins are typically 1 to 2 cm from the skin but may be markedly deeper in obese patients, increasing the risk of complications; these vessels may also be thrombosed (eg, oncology patients), making cannulation impossible and subjecting the patient to a needless and unsuccessful procedure.\n【4】 Ultrasound-guided access has become the standard for venous access in most situations because of these shortcomings. Even a quick, single view can be useful; real-time ultrasound-guided access in either the transverse or longitudinal plane provides information that can reduce access-related complications [8]. However, the utility of ultrasound depends on the skill of the operator and inherent properties of ultrasound waves. As an example, compared with experienced users, novices are not likely sufficiently proficient to fully benefit from ultrasound-guided access [9,10]. Nevertheless, various studies suggest an approximately 50 percent reduction in complications for ultrasound-guided access compared with landmark techniques [11,12]. (See  \"Basic principles of ultrasound-guided venous access\".)\n【5】 Vascular complications related to central venous access are reviewed. Other complications (eg, pneumothorax, air embolism) related to central venous access are reviewed separately. (See  \"Central venous catheters: Overview of complications and prevention in adults\".)\n【6】 ARTERIAL COMPLICATIONS\n【7】 Inadvertent arterial puncture — A potential complication associated with central venous access is inadvertent needle puncture of an associated artery (eg, common femoral artery, carotid artery, innominate artery, subclavian artery, vertebral artery) instead of the targeted vein (image 1). Arterial puncture is noted to occur in about 5 percent of all central venous access procedures, with reported incidences ranging from 1 to 11 percent [13-17]. It remains uncertain when and if coagulation defects should be corrected prior to elective central venous catheter placement [18]. However, the consistent use of ultrasound during central venous access decreases the incidence of vascular complications. Inadvertent arterial puncture is typically reported to occur in less than 1 percent of access cases when ultrasound-guided access is used. (See  \"Basic principles of ultrasound-guided venous access\".)\n【8】 Initial management — Immediate recognition and management of arterial puncture usually prevents subsequent complications. Late recognition of arterial catheterization increases the risk of hemorrhagic or thrombotic complications that may require surgical intervention.\n【9】 The most immediate sign of an inadvertent arterial puncture is pulsatile bleeding from the access needle (algorithm 1), though this may not always be apparent in patients who are critically ill or those without pulsatile flow (eg, left ventricular assist device, hypotensive). Venous blood is darker than arterial blood, which may serve as another subjective indication that an arterial puncture has occurred. More objectively, the access site can be connected to an arterial line setup to assess the waveform (waveform 1) or pressure or sent as an arterial blood gas [14,19]. Ultrasound can also be used to assess the location of the needle or catheter in real-time at bedside. With increasing operator experience, the needle location within the vein can be confirmed by ultrasound before a wire is even passed. If arterial access is not recognized before the sheath or catheter has been placed, several radiographic modalities, including plain films or computed tomography (CT) scans, can be used to identify the insertion site and location of a catheter.\n【10】 Once an arterial puncture is suspected, the needle can be immediately withdrawn and direct but nonocclusive pressure applied to the site continuously for 15 minutes to prevent hematoma formation (algorithm 1). Bleeding usually resolves within 10 to 15 minutes with direct compression, which is more easily performed at the femoral and jugular sites compared with the subclavian site.\n【11】 Vascular referral — Unrecognized arterial puncture with subsequent dilation of the arteriotomy and catheter placement, particularly of large-bore catheters (≥7 French), can lead to life-threatening bleeding into the neck, chest, retroperitoneum, or thigh depending on the access site [20]. Accidental catheterization of the carotid, subclavian, or vertebral artery by a large-bore catheter can cause arterial thrombosis, hemorrhage, stroke, pseudoaneurysm, airway compression, or death. (See 'Bleeding' below and 'Internal bleeding' below.)\n【12】 Simple catheter removal (catheter <7 French), also known as the \"pull-and-pressure\" approach, may be considered for inadvertent cannulation of the common femoral artery (ie, below the inguinal ligament) [14]. However, removal of the catheter from other access sites without further imaging is not recommended, as it can lead to uncontrollable bleeding [15,21,22].\n【13】 If the vessel is cannulated by a large-bore catheter (>7 French), clinicians should consult urgently with a vascular surgeon for catheter removal and repair of the injured artery (algorithm 2) [15,23]. Because tunneled hemodialysis catheters are 12 French or larger in diameter, arterial placement of a tunneled hemodialysis catheter at any site mandates emergency consultation with a vascular surgeon. Removal of the catheter should not be attempted without surgical oversight. When the catheter is in place, arterial tamponade by the catheter may prevent hemorrhage, but removal of such a large-bore device risks serious hemorrhage and almost always requires repair, using either an endovascular or open surgical approach. (See 'Surgical and endovascular management' below.)\n【14】 Bleeding — Bleeding related to central venous access can be external at the access puncture sites, through a catheter tunnel, or internal. Bleeding can be related to an unrecognized inadvertent arterial puncture or other access placement-associated cardiac or vascular injury (arterial or venous). Bleeding is often related to coagulation defects, the correction of which may resolve the problem.\n【15】 External bleeding — External bleeding is typically immediately evident and can be due to arterial or venous injury. This can happen during initial access, vessel dilation, or device insertion [7]. External bleeding is first and foremost treated with direct pressure at the access site or on the tunnel. The next step is to check and treat any coagulopathy. The same principles can be applied to local hematomas. In selected scenarios, external bleeding around the venous catheter or the tunnel may be controlled with external reinforcement of the exit site (eg, suture placement) to tamponade low-pressure bleeding, but surgical referral is typically recommended at this point.\n【16】 Internal bleeding — Internal bleeding is frequently more insidious and may not be recognized immediately. This can present as a local hematoma, a retroperitoneal hematoma in cases of femoral access, or a hemothorax in cases of jugular or subclavian accesses. While serious blood loss associated with central venous catheter placement is uncommon, hematomas that form after inadvertent arterial puncture can compress associated structures. In the case of inadvertent carotid puncture, hematoma can obstruct the airway and be life-threatening [24]. (See 'Initial management' above.)\n【17】 Local hematoma formation is estimated to occur in less than 5 percent of cases in the literature, with retroperitoneal hematomas and hemothoraces rarer still [25]. Frequently, internal bleeding is suspected based on hemodynamic instability and/or laboratory changes and confirmed with radiographic studies like plain radiographs or CT.\n【18】 Hemothorax — Hemothoraces can occur as complications of subclavian or jugular venous access. Chest cavity drainage using a 32 or 36 Fr tube thoracostomy in adults is the standard therapy for these patients [26,27]. Surgical intervention is rarely needed but may be necessary with large hemothoraces exceeding 1500 mL at time of insertion or persistent bleeding greater than 200 mL/hour over four hours indicative of injury to significant structures. (See  \"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Indications and tube selection in adults and children\" and 'Surgical and endovascular management' below.)\n【19】 Retroperitoneal hematoma — Retroperitoneal hematomas from complicated femoral access are traditionally managed nonoperatively. Serial laboratory studies are obtained to identify continued bleeding, which can be confirmed on radiographic studies (most frequently CT) [28,29]. If feasible, anticoagulation should be discontinued and any coagulopathy reversed. Most cases are self-limiting, and surgical intervention is rarely needed [30]. In instances of persistent hemodynamic instability, continued bleeding, and/or compressive symptoms, angiography and coil embolization may be considered [31]. (See 'Surgical and endovascular management' below.)\n【20】 Cardiac injury and pericardial effusion — Injuries to the heart are rare and usually poorly tolerated. A number of early and late pericardial effusions associated with central venous catheter insertion have been reported in the literature [32-34]. Symptom presentation can be related to insertion of guidewires, dilators, or catheters or related to chronic erosion from an indwelling device [35,36]. Clinical manifestations include pericardial effusion with bradycardia, hypotension, low oxygen saturation, and elevated venous pressures. As examples, a tunneled hemodialysis catheter perforating the right atrium can result in severe bleeding and hypotension, whereas placement of a hemodialysis catheter perforating through the myocardium may not be associated with any bleeding but may cause acute pericardial tamponade if hemodialysis is started with catheter tip in the pericardial space.\n【21】 Depending on the injury, evacuation of the pericardial effusion alone may be enough, but most frequently, surgical repair via either thoracotomy or sternotomy is required [36,37]. (See 'Surgical and endovascular management' below.)\n【22】 Delayed complications\n【23】 Arteriovenous fistula — Arteriovenous fistulas are abnormal connections between arteries and veins that can occur with inadvertent arterial puncture during catheter insertion (image 2) or, less frequently, chronic erosion from indwelling devices. A number of case reports exist in the literature describing carotid-jugular [13,38], subclavian-subclavian [39-41], and femoral-femoral [42-44] arteriovenous fistulas, but their exact incidence is likely underreported, as a number of these patients can be largely asymptomatic. Depending on their location, arteriovenous fistulas can present with limb edema, pain, palpable masses, heart failure, or cerebrovascular accidents. Thrill sometimes can be felt on examination, and bruit can be heard on auscultation. If suspected, a contrasted CT scan or angiography is preferred to establish the diagnosis; these patients will have asymmetric, early contrast filling of the adjacent venous system.\n【24】 For symptomatic patients, options include open surgical repair or endovascular treatment. Open surgical repair is standard for accessible lesions and can involve direct surgical repair, patch angioplasty, or interposition grafting depending on the location and extent of the fistula. Select patients may be candidates for endovascular therapy with covered stent placement depending on comorbid conditions and surrounding anatomy. (See  \"Acquired arteriovenous fistula of the lower extremity\", section on 'Surgery'.)\n【25】 Manual compression, frequently used to treat other pathologies, is unlikely to be effective in this situation due to the high flow and short connection between adjacent vessels. (See  \"Acquired arteriovenous fistula of the lower extremity\", section on 'Ultrasound-guided compression'.)\n【26】 Pseudoaneurysm — Pseudoaneurysm can also occur following inadvertent arterial puncture during central venous access. (See 'Inadvertent arterial puncture' above and  \"Femoral artery pseudoaneurysm following percutaneous intervention\".)\n【27】 VENOUS COMPLICATIONS\n【28】 Deep venous thrombosis — Catheter-related thrombosis is a subacute or chronic issue that can occur with indwelling central venous catheters. These are estimated to contribute to 10 percent of all deep venous thrombosis in adults but approximately 50 percent of those in children [45-47]; the majority involve the upper extremities. Risk factors for thrombosis include malignancy, previous venous thrombosis, intensive care unit admission, hypercoagulability, and infection [48,49]. (See  \"Clinical features, diagnosis, and classification of thoracic central venous obstruction\" and  \"Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis in adults\", section on 'Epidemiology and risk factors'.)\n【29】 Symptoms vary depending on the timing, extent, and location of thrombus. Many patients are asymptomatic, but routine screening for catheter-associated thrombosis is not recommended [50,51]. Symptomatic patients complain of pain and swelling near or distal to the access site, and emboli are frequently observed in these patients, though many are not clinically apparent. In patients with symptomatic disease, duplex ultrasound is the diagnostic test of choice, as it is noninvasive and radiation-free, with a sensitivity and specificity of 97 and 96 percent, respectively [52]. Computed tomographic (CT) venography and magnetic resonance (MR) venography are alternatives when operator dependency or anatomy may limit the utility of ultrasound studies. MR venography is preferred over CT if there are no contraindications. Catheter-based venography and intravascular ultrasound may be appropriate when additional intervention is anticipated but is rarely performed as a diagnostic study when noninvasive options are available [53].\n【30】 Anticoagulation is first-line therapy for deep vein thrombosis [54-56]. The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines recommend against removal of a functional indwelling catheter if there is an ongoing need for the catheter and recommend continued anticoagulation as long as the catheter is in place [57]. If the catheter is removed, anticoagulation should continue for at least three months or longer in cancer patients. Novel oral anticoagulants like apixaban and rivaroxaban are recommended over low-molecular-weight heparin and vitamin K antagonist in noncancer patients, whereas low-molecular-weight heparin remains the drug of choice for cancer patients [55]. Catheter-directed thrombolysis decreases the overall clot burden but has not demonstrated consistent long-term results, and guidelines recommend against general use [58-60]. Similarly, percutaneous or open thrombectomy is not appropriate, except for select cases. Prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent catheter-associated vessel thrombosis is also not generally recommended, even among patients with a prior history of thrombosis. (See  \"Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis in adults\", section on 'Treatment' and  \"Overview of thoracic central venous obstruction\", section on 'Management'.)\n【31】 Central venous obstruction — Central venous stenosis is a chronic complication of indwelling central venous devices, particularly among hemodialysis patients. (See  \"Overview of thoracic central venous obstruction\" and  \"Overview of iliocaval venous obstruction\" and  \"Central vein obstruction associated with upper extremity hemodialysis access\".)\n【32】 Intimal trauma, inflammation, and chronic endothelial injury have all been implicated in its pathogenesis [61-63]. The incidence varies between 20 and 40 percent of patients with chronic catheters but is likely under-reported, as many are asymptomatic [61]. Patients can otherwise present with ipsilateral edema or pain. When the superior vena cava (SVC) is involved, patients may experience headaches, facial edema, dyspnea, and hoarseness consistent with SVC syndrome [64]. CT or MR venography is noninvasive and can aid in the diagnosis [65]. Catheter-based venography remains the gold standard, but a number of different techniques have been explored to improve the accuracy of noninvasive techniques. One review noted significant improvement using MR venography to detect venous occlusions with the addition of time-resolved images [66]. The authors' clinical experience also indicates much promise using protocolized dynamic MR venography to characterize central venous lesions and guide therapy.\n【33】 Intervention is not recommended for asymptomatic disease. For symptomatic patients, endovascular revascularization is first-line therapy due to its minimally invasive nature [5] and can be performed concurrently with diagnostic catheter-based venography or after the diagnosis has been established by a less invasive test, depending on the institutional resources. The authors' preference is to use diagnostic catheter-based venography in symptomatic patients to expedite intervention.\n【34】 Recanalization of obstructive lesions is facilitated by using hydrophilic guidewires and support catheters to cross occlusive lesions. Successful traversal rates vary in the literature, ranging from 50 to 93 percent depending on technique, chronicity of the lesion, and degree of sclerosis [67,68]. Open surgical bypass around the occlusion or directly to the right atrium has been reported but is typically reserved for symptomatic patients who have failed endovascular therapy [69,70]. (See  \"Endovenous intervention for thoracic central venous obstruction\" and  \"Central vein obstruction associated with upper extremity hemodialysis access\", section on 'Endovascular outcomes'.)\n【35】 Migration/embolization of catheter components — Migration and embolization of catheter components are most commonly associated with totally implantable venous access devices (TIVAD) but also can be seen with other types of catheters (eg, transhepatic dialysis catheters) [22,71]. Migration and embolization of the catheter or parts of the catheter is reported to be 0.2 to 0.8 percent. The causes of disconnect and subsequent migration are faulty assembly, pressurized flushing (eg, using small caliber needles), and degeneration of the catheter from mechanical stress at the thoracic outlet (ie, pinched off syndrome) accompanied by pulsatility of the heart [72].\n【36】 The most common and earliest sign of disconnection is catheter malfunction that can be associated with local infiltration and swelling. The nature and severity of local symptoms relate to the type of fluid that extravasates. (See  \"Extravasation injury from chemotherapy and other non-antineoplastic vesicants\".)\n【37】 Cardiac complication rates are estimated at 7 percent, including arrythmia and pulmonary artery thrombosis. Migration of the catheter to the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and coronary sinus has been reported. Some of these complications can be fatal, with overall reported mortality of 1.8 percent. Entrapment of catheter fragments in the heart can lead to arrhythmias or perforation [35,36]. Pulmonary fragments can present as symptomatic pulmonary embolism or remain asymptomatic [37]. Plain radiographic films are the first step to assess the position and integrity of the catheter. If fracture or migration is suspected, CT may provide further anatomic detail for retrieval.\n【38】 SURGICAL AND ENDOVASCULAR MANAGEMENT\n【39】 SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Additional features of the disorder have a variable presentation, contributing to disagreement over the disorder’s boundaries and diagnostic criteria.\n【2】 The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) focuses on a more aggressive, grandiose subtype of NPD, while an alternative model, which we favor, describes additional subtypes – a healthier, high-functioning type and a vulnerable, introverted type – and places greater emphasis on problems with self-definition, self-esteem regulation, and affective reactivity.\n【3】 NPD is one of the least studied personality disorders. It appears to be prevalent, highly comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, and associated with significant psychosocial disability. NPD is difficult to treat, and can complicate the treatment of co-occurring disorders.\n【4】 The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of NPD are reviewed here. Treatment of NPD is described separately. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, assessment, and diagnosis of other personality disorders are also described separately. (See  \"Narcissistic personality disorder: Treatment overview\" and  \"Overview of personality disorders\" and  \"Borderline personality disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, course, assessment, and diagnosis\" and  \"Antisocial personality disorder: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis\".)\n【5】 EPIDEMIOLOGY — The prevalence and sociodemographic features of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) are poorly defined, in part because of evolving diagnostic criteria.\n【6】 In studies in the United States and in Europe, the prevalence of NPD in the general population has been estimated as ranging from 0 percent to 6.2 percent [2]. As an example, in a national survey of 35,000 Americans, the lifetime prevalence rate was 6.2 percent; rates were higher in males compared to females (7.7 versus 4.8 percent). In that survey, NPD was significantly more prevalent among Black males and females and Hispanic females, younger adults, and single adults.\n【7】 In clinical studies of outpatient populations, the rate of NPD has ranged from 1 to 17 percent [3,4]; most studies report higher prevalence among males.\n【8】 Comorbidities — Co-occurring disorders are common in clinical observations and in epidemiologic surveys of NPD. Among respondents meeting criteria for NPD in the 2004 to 2005 Wave 2 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, the disorders with the highest rates of comorbidity were [4]:\n【9】 NPD also often co-occurs with antisocial, histrionic, schizotypal, and passive-aggressive personality disorders [5]. Patients with more severe NPD are more likely to have a greater number of co-occurring personality disorders [3]. Comorbidity with antisocial personality disorder has the most profoundly negative impact on prognosis [6,7].\n【10】 Patients with NPD often come to clinical attention seeking treatment for a co-occurring disorder. Comorbidities can complicate diagnosis and treatment decisions; their presence in patients with NPD has been associated with greater functional impairment and elevated suicide risk compared with patients without co-occurring disorders [8].\n【11】 The presence of comorbid narcissistic pathology in individuals presenting with substance use disorders, mood disorders, or anxiety disorders, can greatly complicate management and is associated with a worse prognosis compared with patients lacking comorbid narcissistic pathology [9].\n【12】 PATHOGENESIS — The pathogenesis of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is not known. Most hypotheses invoke a combination of and interaction among genetic, biologic, and psychosocial causes.\n【13】 Genetic — As with other personality disorders, studies of heritability for NPD are suggestive but inconsistent. Studies of personality disorders overall demonstrate heritability rates above 60 percent, making a significant genetic influence highly likely [10]. NPD has not been assessed in any family or adoption studies, but twin studies suggest heritability varying from 25 percent to 79 percent. A study using a broad definition of NPD (three or more criteria met) found 45 percent concordance in monozygotic twins and 9 percent in dizygotic twins [8]. A study using the Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology reported the heritability of narcissism to be 53 percent [11]. The heritability of specific traits (need for adulation, attention seeking, grandiosity, and need for approval) ranged from 37 percent for grandiosity to 50 percent for need for approval.\n【14】 Biologic — Research relating to biologic factors and NPD is sparse. Brain imaging studies on the neural correlates of empathy have included studies of NPD as well as those of subjects with narcissistic traits [12]. These studies provide preliminary data on neural correlates of the impaired emotional empathy characteristic of individuals with NPD. As examples:\n【15】 Psychosocial — The empirical literature on parenting and NPD is inconsistent, but overall provides some support for the proposition that parenting styles can contribute to the development of NPD, and that different facets of narcissism may have different psychosocial etiologies [15]. In the absence of empirical data, models of pathogenesis based on clinical experience with NPD patients and observations of parenting have been developed within psychodynamic, attachment, and social learning frameworks [16-18].\n【16】 These models relate NPD to problems in the development of a sense of self in early life, and increasingly emphasize the role of the child’s genetic predisposition in shaping both the child’s responses to the environment as well as in shaping his or her environment (ie, eliciting particular responses from caretakers). It has been hypothesized that disruptions in the caretaker-child relationship, reflecting parental failure to adequately meet the developmental needs of the child in the setting of the child’s temperamental predispositions, interfere with normal developmental processes. These deficiencies are compounded over time as a result of repeated, pathogenic interactions with caretakers and the child’s resulting expectations and behavior in relation to others.\n【17】 Theorists have pointed variously to the role of parental over-involvement, overprotectiveness, and overvaluation of the child, often coupled with excessive frustration, parental coldness, aggression, and rejection, as potentially contributory to the development of narcissistic pathology in childhood and NPD later in life.\n【18】 Though most children who experience trauma do not develop personality disorders, evidence from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions [3,4] shows an overall association between NPD (and other personality disorders) and childhood abuse and neglect [19,20]. Other research supports the association between emotional abuse and NPD, specifically with covert narcissistic traits [21].\n【19】 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS — Among the personality disorders, narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) is associated with the most variable presentation and the widest range of severity. There is strong agreement among clinicians and researchers with expertise on the subject that there are different subtypes of NPD.\n【20】 Core features — Despite the variability among presentations, all individuals with NPD share central clinical features, some of which are and some of which are not emphasized in DSM-5-TR (see 'Diagnosis' below):\n【21】 In DSM-5-TR:\n【22】 Not in DSM-5-TR:\n【23】 Grandiosity — Individuals with NPD have an exaggerated sense of self-importance, viewing themselves as superior to others and deserving of special treatment. Feelings of superiority are often overt, but may also be covert, hidden behind feelings of inferiority or deficiency. (See 'Subtypes' below.)\n【24】 Grandiose attitudes, whether overt or covert, and feelings of being exceptional or special, are often complemented by private fantasies of unlimited success, beauty, brilliance, power, or ideal love.\n【25】 Excessive need for admiration — Individuals with NPD have an excessive need for admiration. They have a constant need to experience themselves as the center of attention, regardless of the setting, perpetually grabbing the limelight and monopolizing social conversations. When attention is not forthcoming, or others receive the attention they feel they themselves deserve, the individuals with NPD are prone to feeling slighted, mistreated depleted, and enraged.\n【26】 Superficial and exploitative relationships — NPD is characterized by markedly superficial relationships, based on surface attributes rather than the unique personal qualities of the other. Relationships are valued only to the extent that they are viewed as beneficial, either providing material gain or enhancing self-esteem. As a result, individuals with NPD are often drawn to wealthy, beautiful, or famous people, with the aim of self-enhancement.\n【27】 Lack of empathy — Individuals with NPD lack the capacity to empathize with the needs of others. Some individuals with NPD may be excessively attuned to the reactions of others, but only if these reactions are perceived as relevant to the self, while others may seem strangely oblivious. In either case, emotional empathy, the ability to “feel with,” or care about the emotional needs or experience of others, even one’s closest loved ones, is severely limited, and may be totally lacking, in NPD [22,23].\n【28】 Identity disturbance — Underlying the spectrum of NPD presentations is a disturbance of identity formation. In contrast to the flexible and reality-based self-experience that characterizes normal identity formation, or the fragmented, black and white views of self in relation to others that characterize identity formation in borderline personality disorder, in NPD we see a sense of self that is relatively stable, but highly superficial, extremely rigid, and often fragile – a disturbed self-state in which stability depends on maintaining the view that one is exceptional. This grandiose and rigidly inflexible sense of self is easily threatened, sustained only by receiving constant feedback of superiority from the environment, and collapsing when such feedback in unavailable. To maintain the integrity of their self-state, individuals with NPD must retreat from or deny any realities that might challenge their grandiosity.\n【29】 Attachment and dependence difficulties — In NPD, self-esteem and self-definition are entirely reliant on feedback from the environment. In this circumstance, relationships are “functional” tools to shore up positive self-states and self-definition. Interactions with others remain superficial and need-fulfilling in orientation. Genuine intimacy is avoided insofar as it confronts narcissistic individuals with the recognition that others have desirable attributes that they themselves lack.\n【30】 Narcissistic relationships have high measured rates of “vindictive and contemptuous behavior,” along with low empathy scores [24]. Results of a study on the effect of narcissistic features in marriages confirm the expected steep decline in marital satisfaction and steep increases in marital problems over time [25].\n【31】 Chronic emptiness and boredom — Narcissistic patients complain frequently of emptiness, restlessness, and boredom – affective experiences that appear to represent baseline emotional states in NPD. In the setting of narcissistic pathology, emotion regulation mirrors fluctuations in self-states and self-esteem; attention seeking and the admiration of others will lead to positive affect states, but when attention and praise are not available, individuals with NPD quickly become restless and feel depleted, empty, or depressed. The diminished capacity to invest deeply in relationships or in creativity, beyond gratification of narcissistic goals, is a chronic vulnerability to feelings of emptiness and boredom [17,26].\n【32】 Life transition vulnerabilities — The nature of identity formation in NPD can make it difficult to maintain reality-based personal and professional goals over time. The incremental growth, the deferred gratification, and the compromises required by school, jobs, or relationships can feel intolerable, and patients often withdraw to protect their feelings of specialness. At the same time, narcissistic individuals of any age may convey a sense that time is suspended, as if they exist outside of and are exempt from the passage of years; they may defer careers or relationships in the implicit belief that they are in a perpetual state of youthful potential.\n【33】 Young adults with pathological narcissism can present with a syndrome of “failure to launch.” These stalled transitions occur as students move from high school to college, or from college to postgraduate training or to careers; young adults may stop attending classes, or not complete job applications or fail to attend interviews at the precise moment these failures will be the most damaging. Realistically pursuing a particular career path or academic degree can be felt as “ordinary,” or as “settling for less,” a perceived limit on the grandiose fantasies by which these individuals have been sustained.\n【34】 The aging process can be especially challenging for individuals with NPD. Older adult narcissists can become depressed or act out as their function declines in old age and as they feel they are receiving decreased attention from others (often because of their exploitative and superficial relationships); it can be a devastating realization that expectations of uniqueness and specialness have not been met [17].\n【35】 Subtypes — There is strong empirical and clinical support for two distinct presentations, or subtypes, of NPD, the grandiose or “overt” subtype and the vulnerable or “covert” subtype [27]. The distinction between subtypes depends on whether core narcissistic grandiosity is openly expressed or masked, and whether stability is maintained by outward arrogance and evoked praise, or by hiding grandiose self-states behind feelings of inadequacy and inferiority. There is growing empirical and clinical support for a third, high-functioning subtype of NPD [28,29]. Though with dramatically different presentations and levels of functioning, individuals in all three subtypes suffer from a grandiose and superficial sense of self, poverty of interpersonal relations and intimacy, and deficiencies in empathy described above. (See 'Core features' above.)\n【36】 High-functioning subtype — The high-functioning, exhibitionistic, autonomous subtype of NPD is relatively adaptive and stable. Individuals in this group may not appear, at first glance, to have a personality disorder at all. They are competitive, arrogant, and have an exaggerated sense of self-importance. While their grandiosity and excessive need for admiration interfere with the ability to obtain sustained gratification from work or personal relationships, they are otherwise able to use their narcissistic traits to succeed. These individuals may act out sexually to bolster self-esteem and obtain needed stimulation, and often complain of boredom.\n【37】 Mr. A is a 55-year-old married man who presents complaining of marital dissatisfaction. He has a successful academic research career, and is highly competitive inside of work and out; he has an active social life, but he identifies himself in groups as the “alpha” and likes to be the center of attention. Mr. A describes that at the very beginning of his marriage there was a modicum of closeness and an engaged sexual life, but he soon became bored with his wife and lost interest. He has had affairs with a series of women who were not his social and intellectual equals, and whom he supported with housing and funds. He denies that his infidelities have had any impact on his relationship with his wife (“one has nothing to do with the other”), but is chronically troubled by the sense that could he “do better” with someone else.\n【38】 Grandiose/overt subtype — The grandiose, overt, “thick-skinned” subtype of NPD corresponds closely with description of NPD in the DSM-5-TR. In this group the sense of being exceptional is overt; these individuals appear arrogant, entitled, and demonstrate little observable anxiety. Socially, they are extraverted and attention seeking, and can be superficially charming and socially adept, but struggle with closeness and feelings of dependency. Interpersonally, they are exploitative, lack true empathy, and use their understanding of other’s needs for their own self-advancement. Individuals in this group can be aggressive or intimidating, especially when threatened.\n【39】 Ms. B is a 29-year-old single woman with a history of opiate and marijuana use, currently unemployed. She presented to her local urgent care clinic for back pain not responsive to conventional analgesics and requesting oxycodone (“nothing else works!”). She was flattering and flirtatious with the resident physician who took her history and examined her; when he explained that he would have to speak with her primary care physician before writing a prescription for a narcotic, Ms. B began to insult and bully him. The resident spoke with Ms. B’s sister, whose contact information Ms. B provided. The sister explained that the patient was estranged from the family because she had financially exploited her siblings and her parents. Since being fired one year earlier from a remunerative job in residential real estate, she had been unable to find employment meeting her lofty expectations for herself, preferring instead to live off money from her father, and she had secretly opened a credit card in her mother’s name and incurred a large debt.\n【40】 Vulnerable/covert subtype — Individuals presenting with the vulnerable, covert, “thin-skinned” subtype of NPD are openly anxious and in distress, and are often interpersonally and occupationally impoverished. In this group, the grandiosity and sense of being exceptional that characterize NPD are superficially masked, cloaked in overt feelings of deficiency. These individuals suffer from chronic feelings of inferiority and inadequacy, are preoccupied with evaluating themselves in relation to others, and are extraordinarily self-absorbed. Socially they appear inhibited, shy, withdrawn, and hypersensitive to criticism (“thin-skinned”). This surface presentation masks more commonplace features of narcissism: they are privately absorbed with envying and devaluing others, and frequently withdraw from life’s challenges to protect their hidden grandiosity and entitlement. They often harbor fantasies that they will “eventually” triumph, or that they are special, unique, but fragile, and so sequester themselves from a world for which they feel contempt. In adolescents, a common feature of vulnerable narcissism is a “failure to launch.”\n【41】 Mr. C is a 33-year-old single man with a history of Crohn disease who presented to an outpatient mental health clinic for treatment of chronic mild depression and social phobia. Immediately after college he began a career-level job, but quit when he was passed over for advancement. Since that time, he has held a series of low-level jobs that “have not worked out,” and he currently works part-time stocking shelves at a local pharmacy. At his assessment at the clinic he describes his mood as “depressed…forever.” He has no friends or romantic attachments, no hobbies or passions, and regularly tells his family that he is bored and that “life is not worth living.” He avoids his Crohn medication when he gets depressed and eats foods that trigger his symptoms; he has had multiple hospitalizations for bleeding and abdominal pain. He tells his interviewer he feels he is inadequate and a failure, but also that he resents others’ advantages and success. He blames his failures on people who don’t recognize all he has to offer. He fantasizes that his employer will finally recognize his special talents and promote him to a senior managerial position; at other times, he imagines humiliating his boss with a display of superior knowledge.\n【42】 Many individuals with NPD fluctuate between grandiose and vulnerable states [30]. Because these individuals are characteristically rigid and adapt poorly, changes in external circumstances can lead to extreme shifts in mood and level of functioning. The grandiose narcissist may feel helpless and victimized, his grandiosity deflated, when served with divorce papers, for example; it would be typical that he reconstitute with the restored conviction that the partner is unworthy, with no sense of his own role in the conflict. A successful venture may induce a brief period of exalted confidence and grandiosity in the vulnerable, withdrawn narcissist, which then may crumble as they are confronted with increased responsibilities and expectations.\n【43】 Suicide — NPD is a significant risk factor for completed suicide, for suicide attempts, and for suicide attempts of high lethality. The vulnerable subtype of NPD appears to be most strongly linked with suicide attempts and with nonsuicidal self-injury [31]. This observation is consistent with the much stronger association between vulnerable narcissism and psychological distress, negative affect, depression, and anxiety [32].\n【44】 As examples, research findings of associations between NPD and suicidality include:\n【45】 Clinical features of suicidality in patients with NPD include:\n【46】 The pattern of multiple suicide attempts and of higher lethality attempts is particularly significant because NPD patients have more fragile attachments, with unstable treatment alliances, high levels of treatment resistance, and high rates of treatment dropout. (See  \"Overview of the therapeutic relationship in psychiatric practice\" and  \"Approaches to the therapeutic relationship in patients with personality disorders\".)\n【47】 These features can leave suicidal patients with NPD beyond the reach of personal or professional support or interventions. There are no evidence-based strategies for the management of suicidality specifically in narcissistic patients, and there are no empirical data for the narcissistic features that most associate with suicides and suicide attempts. Management of suicidal patients is discussed separately. (See  \"Narcissistic personality disorder: Treatment overview\" and  \"Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults\".)\n【48】 COURSE — The paucity of research data makes the course of narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) difficult to assess. Much of the literature and our clinical experience suggest that narcissistic features persist over time; these patients appear to be resistant to treatment and to change. Some research, however, suggests that aspects of NPD may remit:\n【49】 ASSESSMENT — A diagnostic evaluation of a patient with possible narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) requires a thorough symptom picture and assessment of psychological, interpersonal, and vocational functioning. Given the range of NPD phenotypes, the evaluation should include history from family, friends, and from past treatments, along with assessment of:\n【50】 Since narcissistic patients struggle with feelings of dependency and find attachment difficult, the patient’s experience of past treatments should be explored as useful diagnostic and prognostic data. NPD has high treatment drop-out rates (above 60 percent in some studies) [40], and a series of failed therapies and poor attachments (grossly devalued or highly idealized) suggests a poor prognosis, especially if accompanied by antisocial traits [7]. Patients should be assessed for comorbid mental disorders that can complicate treatment, and a detailed substance history is essential. (See 'Comorbidities' above.)\n【51】 In the clinical interview, focusing on the patient’s descriptions of significant others can be particularly helpful in diagnosing NPD. These descriptions are characteristically derogating or, alternatively, colored by idealization. Most striking, however, is the markedly superficial and vague, shadowy quality of the narcissistic individual’s experience of others. In contrast, the narcissistic individual’s sense of him- or herself may be more intact and nuanced, albeit colored by grandiosity and self-deprecation.\n【52】 The patient should be assessed for vulnerable as well as grandiose forms of narcissistic pathology. Although grandiose presentations may be more obvious and may seem more overtly pathological, vulnerable forms of NPD are easy to miss and can be equally debilitating and clinically challenging.\n【53】 Assess carefully for pathology of moral functioning (dishonesty, exploitation) as well as frank antisocial features.\n【54】 Assessment instruments — Given the variable clinical features that characterize NPD and the sometimes-subtle presentation of higher functioning narcissistic pathology, a systematic interview by an experienced clinician may be the most reliable way to diagnose NPD. There are a variety of structured instruments for assessing NPD. While some have demonstrated reliability and have been used in research [31,41-46], none have been used routinely in clinical care, diagnostically or to track clinical change over time.\n【55】 DIAGNOSIS\n【56】 Diagnostic criteria — DSM-5-TR criteria for narcissistic personality disorder (NPD) [47] have been widely criticized for overemphasizing one subtype of NPD, the grandiose/overt type, while failing to cover other core features and subtypes of the disorder [48,49]. These shortcomings were addressed through the development of an alternative model and diagnostic criteria for NPD, which we favor for clinical use over the DSM-5-TR criteria. (See 'DSM-5-TR' below and 'Alternative-model diagnostic criteria' below.)\n【57】 DSM-5-TR — DSM-5-TR diagnostic criteria for the disorder include [50]:\n【58】 DSM-5-TR criteria for NPD [50] have been widely criticized for overemphasizing aggression, grandiosity, entitlement, exploitation of others, and need for admiration (characteristics of a subset of narcissistic individuals), while failing to cover other core psychological features of the disorder, including vulnerable self-esteem, feelings of inferiority, emptiness and boredom, and affective reactivity and distress [48,49]. In this view, the DSM-5-TR criteria describe a highly disturbed and aggressive subset of the NPD population, corresponding quite closely to the grandiose subtype, while failing to cover vulnerable and high-functioning NPD subtypes. (See 'Grandiose/overt subtype' above.)\n【59】 Alternative-model diagnostic criteria — In the American Psychiatric Association’s development of DSM-5, the work group responsible for the personality disorders proposed the alternative-model diagnostic criteria for NPD. These criteria added problems with self-functioning (ie, identity and self-direction) and interpersonal functioning (ie, empathy and intimacy) to pathological traits highly characteristic of the disorder.\n【60】 The alternative-model diagnostic criteria for NPD include:\n【61】 Subtypes — Trait “specifiers” are used to identify NPD subtypes:\n【62】 The alternative criteria were not ultimately adopted for the DSM-5 [51], which retained the NPD criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV); however, they were included in section III of the DSM-5, “Emerging Measures and Models” [47,52].\n【63】 In our opinion, the alternative criteria for NPD have several advantages over the DSM-5-TR criteria: coverage of all of the identified subtypes, inclusion of the many patients diagnosed with NPD in clinical practice who do not meet DSM-5-TR criteria, and inclusion of the individual’s psychological experience and functioning in characterizing the disorder, in contrast to the DSM-5-TR’s dominant focus on observable clinical features and patterns of behavior.\n【64】 ICD-11 — With the transition from the World Health Organization Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) to the 11th Revision (ICD-11), the ICD has abandoned all categorical definitions of personality disorders, focusing instead on global and shared features that apply to all personality disorders. In the ICD-11, personality disorder diagnosis is based on evaluation of:\n【65】 Degree of dysfunction is characterized as mild (mild personality disorder), moderate (moderate personality disorder) or severe (severe personality disorder). Trait domain specifiers may be added to describe specific features of a patient’s clinical presentation. The emphasis on self and interpersonal functioning in ICD-11 is similar to the approach adopted in the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (SCID-5-AMPD). In contrast to the SCID-5-AMPD, ICD-11 does not provide specific diagnostic criteria for any personality disorder, including NPD [53].\n【66】 Differential diagnosis — While the diagnosis of NPD can be difficult to distinguish from other psychiatric illnesses, a careful assessment of personality functioning across time, coupled with careful evaluation of patients’ sense of self and their interpersonal functioning, can often make the diagnosis clear. The differential diagnosis for NPD includes mood disorders, substance use and substance-induced disorders, as well as other personality disorders.\n【67】 All of the above diagnoses can also be comorbid with NPD, complicating diagnosis, and worsening prognosis; in addition, patients with other personality disorders, as well as those with affective illness, chronic psychotic illness, substance-related disorders and anxiety disorders may present with narcissistic traits in the absence of NPD.\n【68】 SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See  \"Classification of hematopoietic neoplasms\".)\n【2】 The diagnostic category of DLBCL is heterogeneous in terms of morphology, genetics, and biologic behavior. A number of clinicopathologic entities are now recognized in the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification that are sufficiently distinct to be considered separate diagnostic categories:\n【3】 Each of these is discussed separately in the sections that follow the general discussion of DLBCL or in their own topics. In addition, the WHO classification includes several disease categories that have features that overlap with DLBCL and other entities [2,3]:\n【4】 The epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathologic features, and diagnosis of DLBCL are reviewed in this topic.\n【5】 The pathobiology and treatment of DLBCL and approach to the diagnosis, staging, and prognosis of the lymphomas are discussed separately. (See  \"Pathobiology of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma\" and  \"Clinical presentation and initial evaluation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\" and  \"Pretreatment evaluation and staging of non-Hodgkin lymphomas\" and  \"Initial treatment of limited stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma\" and  \"Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma\".)\n【6】 EPIDEMIOLOGY — DLBCL is the most common lymphoma and accounts for approximately 25 percent of all NHLs in the developed world [1,4,5]. In the United States and England, the incidence of DLBCL is approximately 7 cases per 100,000 persons per year [1,6]. In Europe as a whole, the incidence is approximately 4.92 cases per 100,000 persons per year [7]. Incidence varies by ethnicity, with White Americans having higher rates than Black, Asian, and American Indian or Alaska Native individuals, in order of decreasing incidence [1,6,8]. By comparison, the incidence in Denmark is approximately 3 cases per 100,000 adults per year [9]. DLBCL appears to be a more frequent subtype of NHL in Central and South America, where it accounts for approximately 40 percent of NHLs [10].\n【7】 Like most other NHLs, there is a male predominance with approximately 55 percent of cases occurring in men [1]. Incidence increases with age; the median age at presentation is 64 years for patients as a whole, but appears to be younger for Black compared with White Americans [11]. Familial aggregation of patients with DLBCL and other NHL subtypes has been noted [12,13]. As an example, a large population-based observational study of patients from Sweden and Denmark reported that relatives of probands with aggressive NHL had an approximately 3.5-fold increased risk of developing NHL [12].\n【8】 PATHOGENESIS — DLBCL arises from a mature B cell and is usually comprised of cells resembling centroblasts or immunoblasts, two distinct types of activated B cells. The molecular pathogenesis of DLBCL is complex and includes both genetic lesions that are relatively specific for this disease (ie, rearrangements of BCL6) and molecular alterations that are shared with other NHL variants. The pathogenesis of DLBCL is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"Pathobiology of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma\".)\n【9】 In addition to occurring de novo, DLBCL can arise through the transformation of many different types of low grade B cell lymphomas, including B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (eg, Richter's transformation), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, marginal zone (MALT) lymphoma, and splenic marginal zone lymphoma. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"Richter transformation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma\" and  \"Histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma\".)\n【10】 DLBCL is an AIDS-defining malignancy. The pathogenesis of NHL in the setting of HIV infection is incompletely understood, but chronic B cell stimulation and T cell immunodeficiency leading to loss of control of transforming viruses, particularly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are thought to play important roles. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"HIV-related lymphomas: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathobiology\" and  \"HIV-related lymphomas: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\".)\n【11】 CLINICAL PRESENTATION — Patients with DLBCL typically present with a rapidly enlarging symptomatic mass, most usually nodal enlargement in the neck or abdomen, or, in the case of primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma, the mediastinum, but may present as a mass lesion anywhere in the body. Extranodal involvement is common among those presenting with stage I/II disease [14]. Systemic \"B\" symptoms (ie, fever, weight loss, drenching night sweats) are observed in approximately 30 percent of patients, and the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is elevated in over one-half [15,16]. A more detailed discussion of systemic symptoms seen in patients with NHL is presented separately, along with the specific definitions of B symptoms. (See  \"Clinical presentation and initial evaluation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\", section on 'Systemic \"B\" symptoms'.)\n【12】 Approximately 60 percent of patients will present with advanced stage DLBCL (usually stage III or IV disease) while 40 percent have more localized disease, usually defined as that which can be contained within one irradiation field (table 1) [15,16]. The bone marrow is involved in up to 30 percent of cases, but may be of a discordant histologic type, such as follicular lymphoma [17], in as many as half of those cases. The staging of DLBCL is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"Pretreatment evaluation and staging of non-Hodgkin lymphomas\", section on 'Staging'.)\n【13】 In up to 40 percent of cases, the disease arises in extranodal extramedullary tissues [9]. The most common site of primary extranodal disease is the stomach/gastrointestinal tract (picture 1), but the disease can arise in virtually any tissue, including the testis, bone, thyroid, salivary glands, tonsil, skin, liver, breast, adrenals, kidneys, nasal cavity, ocular adnexa, paranasal sinuses, uterine cervix, vagina, and central nervous system [18-41]. Many of these presentations are discussed separately:\n【14】 Conversely, primary nodal disease may secondarily involve the liver, kidneys, lung, bone marrow, and central nervous system. DLBCL also can be locally highly invasive, leading to compression of vessels (eg, superior vena cava syndrome) or airways (eg, tracheo-bronchial compression), involvement of peripheral nerves, and destruction of bone (eg, cord compression), requiring urgent attention. (See  \"Malignancy-related superior vena cava syndrome\" and  \"Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression\".)\n【15】 DLBCL is an AIDS-defining malignancy. When compared with lymphoma in the HIV-negative population, systemic lymphoma in the HIV-positive population is characterized by more frequent B symptoms (ie, fever, weight loss, night sweats), extranodal disease, involvement of unusual locations (eg, body cavity, rectum, soft tissue), and advanced stage at diagnosis. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"HIV-related lymphomas: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\".)\n【16】 PATHOLOGY — DLBCL is a heterogeneous group of tumors consisting of large, transformed B cells with prominent nucleoli and basophilic cytoplasm, a diffuse growth pattern and a high (>40 percent) proliferation fraction (picture 2).\n【17】 Morphology\n【18】 Typical morphology — Lymph nodes usually demonstrate complete effacement of the normal architecture by sheets of atypical lymphoid cells. The tumor cells are of large size (eg, nuclei at least twice the size of a small lymphocyte and larger than the nucleus of a tissue macrophage) and often resemble normal centroblasts or immunoblasts (picture 3). Centroblasts are large, noncleaved cells with round or oval nuclei, vesicular chromatin, often multiple peripheral nucleoli, and a narrow rim of basophilic cytoplasm (picture 4). Immunoblasts are larger cells with very prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm, often with plasmacytoid features (picture 5). Some tumors contain mixtures of centroblastic and immunoblastic forms.\n【19】 In addition to the common centroblastic and immunoblastic morphologies, several other cytologic variants are recognized (eg, multilobated and anaplastic), but their clinical significance is debated [42]. In addition, there is poor intra- and inter-observer reproducibility among hematopathologists attempting to subtype DLBCL based on the appearance of the tumor cells, and as a result the morphologic subtypes of DLBCL are lumped together in a single diagnostic category in the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphoid neoplasms [3]. In contrast, plasmablastic lymphoma is a morphologic variant that displays immunophenotypic characteristics that allow for its distinction from other DLBCLs.\n【20】 Plasmablastic lymphoma — The tumor cells of plasmablastic lymphoma typically have large, eccentrically placed nuclei, often with prominent single nucleoli, and abundant basophilic cytoplasm, which together constitute a \"plasmablast-like\" appearance. Unlike the other morphologic variants described above, plasmablastic tumors are immunophenotypically distinct. Specifically, these tumors are comprised of late B cells that express plasma cell markers (eg, CD138) instead of the pan-B cell markers found in typical DLBCL (eg, CD20 and CD79a). Some tumors belonging to this group have distinctive genetic or clinicopathologic features. For example, oropharyngeal plasmablastic lymphomas occur most frequently in HIV-positive individuals and are often positive for Epstein-Barr virus. Another rare genetic subtype of plasmablastic lymphoma has rearrangements of the ALK tyrosine kinase gene, discussed in more detail below. Because of the plasmacellular differentiation of these tumors, they can be easily mistaken for anaplastic myeloma when they involve the bone marrow. (See  \"HIV-related lymphomas: Epidemiology, risk factors, and pathobiology\" and 'Other mutations' below.)\n【21】 Immunophenotype — The immunophenotype of DLBCL can be confirmed by histochemistry or flow cytometry (figure 1). Tumor cells in DLBCL generally express pan B cell antigens (CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a), as well as CD45 (picture 6). Fifty to 75 percent of tumors express surface or cytoplasmic monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig), most often of the IgM isotype. The immunoglobulin variable region genes have undergone rearrangement and are commonly somatically mutated; clonally related subpopulations may express alternative isotypes (isotype switch variants) [43]. Expression of CD30 is present in approximately 25 percent of cases (particularly the anaplastic variant) and is associated with more favorable disease [44,45]. Uncommonly, DLBCLs express CD5, a finding associated with more aggressive disease and worse prognosis [45-49].\n【22】 BCL2 protein is expressed in 25 to 80 percent of DLBCL (picture 7) [50-55]. Approximately 70 percent express B cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) protein; this expression is independent of BCL6 gene rearrangement (picture 8) [53,54]. Other markers that are commonly expressed include CD10 (30 to 60 percent of cases) and MUM1/IRF4 (35 to 65 percent of cases). Although MUM1/IRF4 and BCL6 are not coexpressed in normal B cells, coexpression of both markers is found in up to 50 percent of DLBCLs. The proliferative fraction of cells, as determined by Ki-67 staining, is usually higher than 40 percent, and may occasionally be >90 percent, which may make distinguishing DLBCL from Burkitt lymphoma difficult in some cases (picture 9). (See  \"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma\" and  \"Pathobiology of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma\", section on 'Aberrant BCL6 expression'.)\n【23】 Genetic features — Most cases of DLBCL have genetic abnormalities, but there is no typical or diagnostic cytogenetic change. Most tumors demonstrate rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes and somatic mutations of the variable regions of these genes [56,57].\n【24】 Alterations in BCL6 — The BCL6 gene, located on chromosome 3, is rearranged in 20 to 40 percent of cases and shows mutations in the 5' noncoding region in 70 percent [58-62]. Over 20 different translocations involving BCL6 have been identified. Both 5' noncoding mutations of the BCL6 proto-oncogene and mutations of the immunoglobulin gene variable regions are found in normal germinal center cells [63-65]; their presence in DLBCL is consistent with a germinal center or post-germinal center stage of differentiation. The 5' noncoding mutations abolish negative autoregulation of expression by BCL6, which is a transcriptional repressor, whereas the translocations replace the BCL6 promoter with strong, constitutively active promoters derived from many different genes. The net effect of both the mutations and translocations is the same: overexpression of BCL6, which is a common oncogenic mechanism in DLBCL. (See  \"Pathobiology of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma\", section on 'Aberrant BCL6 expression'.)\n【25】 (14;18) translocation — The t(14;18) seen in >90 percent of cases of follicular lymphomas is also present in approximately 30 percent of patients with DLBCL. Such cases may represent histologic transformation of a prior follicular lymphoma or may be a de novo DLBCL subset demonstrating a germinal center B cell gene expression profile [66,67]. In cases of histologic transformation, mutations of TP53 are observed at a high frequency as well as homozygous deletions at 9p21, which involve the p15 and p16 tumor suppressors [68-71]. (See  \"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, diagnosis, and prognosis of follicular lymphoma\", section on 'Histologic transformation' and  \"Pathobiology of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma\", section on 'TP53 mutations'.)\n【26】 The t(14;18) is associated with nodal and disseminated disease, but is not associated with a worse prognosis. Furthermore, as with BCL6, expression of BCL2 is observed in many tumors without BCL2 translocations [50,72].\n【27】 Other mutations — Other abnormalities have been reported in DLBCL [73-75]:\n【28】 DIAGNOSIS\n【29】 Evaluation — The diagnosis of DLBCL is best made based by excisional tissue biopsy, most commonly a lymph node. While an excisional lymph node biopsy is the preferred diagnostic test for most patients, some patients do not present with overt lymphadenopathy and require the pathologic evaluation of another tissue (ie, pleural fluid, spleen) for diagnosis. A discussion of lymph node and tissue biopsy including the selection of a lymph node to biopsy is presented separately. (See  \"Clinical presentation and initial evaluation of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\", section on 'Lymph node and tissue biopsy'.)\n【30】 Diagnosis — The pathologic diagnosis of DLBCL is based on morphology and immunophenotyping, which is essential to make the diagnosis. Staining for pan-B cell markers, such as CD20 and CD79a, is sufficient to establish the diagnosis in many cases, but a much broader set of stains may be needed in cases with atypical morphologic features. In rare cases with plasmablastic features, correlation with other clinical and laboratory features may be necessary to distinguish the tumor from multiple myeloma.\n【31】 As described in more detail above, DLBCL is a heterogeneous group of tumors consisting of large, transformed B cells with prominent nucleoli and basophilic cytoplasm, a diffuse growth pattern and a high proliferation fraction. Tumor cells in DLBCL generally express pan B cell antigens (CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a). The majority has genetic abnormalities, but there is no single cytogenetic change that is typical or diagnostic.\n【32】 Molecular subtype — The initial pathologic evaluation of DLBCL should include an assessment of molecular risk to further classify cases into germinal center B cell DLBCL and nongerminal center B cell lymphoma (including activated B cell lymphoma) and to identify double hit DLBCL [2]. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"Prognosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma\", section on 'Molecular genetics' and  \"Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma\", section on 'Clinical and laboratory'.)\n【33】 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — The differential diagnosis of DLBCL includes other entities that can result in lymphadenopathy and similar pathologic features. These include infectious mononucleosis and malignancies such as carcinoma, melanoma, and other types of lymphoma (table 2). These are described in more detail below.\n【34】 The differential diagnosis of patients presenting with primary extranodal involvement depends upon the presenting symptoms. Many of these extranodal presentations are described in more detail separately:\n【35】 Infectious mononucleosis — Both infectious mononucleosis and the immunoblastic variant of DLBCL have prominent immunoblasts and Hodgkin-like cells on lymph node biopsy. However, T immunoblasts predominate in infectious mononucleosis, while large B cells predominate in DLBCL. (See  \"Infectious mononucleosis\".)\n【36】 \"Gray zone lymphoma\" — The colloquial term \"gray zone lymphoma\" has been used by some to describe lymphomas with morphologic, immunophenotypic, and/or genotypic features that are either intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) or between DLBCL and Hodgkin lymphoma but do not clearly fit into any of these individual categories. These terms lack precision and are not used in the current World Health Organization (WHO) classification; as such, these entities should be categorized according to the descriptions below.\n【37】 Burkitt lymphoma — The differentiation between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) can be difficult since DLBCL can have a high proliferation fraction and cytogenetic abnormalities, such as t(8;14), that are typically seen in BL, and BL can have atypical morphologic features, including some variation in cell size.\n【38】 In the 2017 revision of the WHO classification system, a category previously described as \"B cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and BL\" was eliminated due to concerns regarding imprecision in the definition and inconsistency in its application [2,3]. Instead, the following was proposed:\n【39】 This remains a difficult and somewhat controversial diagnostic area and additional refinements are likely to be forthcoming.\n【40】 Features that favor the diagnosis of DLBCL over BL or \"high grade B cell lymphoma\" include the presence of isolated cytogenetic abnormalities involving BCL6 or BCL2 and Ki-67 staining in less than 95 percent of the tumor cells. Expression of BCL2 (which is present in most DLBCLs and usually absent from BL) is helpful in distinguishing DLBCL from BL, but cannot distinguish between DLBCL and \"high grade B cell lymphoma\" with or without MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements, as these tumors frequently overexpress BCL2. Gene expression profiling also shows promise in distinguishing DLBCL from BL [86,87]. In contrast, \"high grade B cell lymphoma\" with or without MYC, BCL2, and BCL6 rearrangements tend to have gene expression profiles intermediate between DLBCL and BL and are best recognized by other criteria (morphology, immunophenotype, and genotype). (See  \"Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma\", section on 'Diffuse large B cell lymphoma'.)\n【41】 Hodgkin lymphoma — The 2017 WHO classification system provides an overlap category termed \"B cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma\" [2,3]. This category includes tumors that morphologically resemble classical Hodgkin lymphoma, but have immunophenotypes that are more typical of DLBCL.\n【42】 Some cases of the T cell histiocyte rich large B cell variant bear some resemblance to Hodgkin lymphoma of either the lymphocyte predominant or lymphocyte rich classic types [88-91]. Lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (LPHL) usually has a nodular growth pattern and presents with low-stage disease, in contrast to T cell/histiocyte-rich large B cell lymphoma, which grows in a diffuse pattern and typically presents with disseminated disease involving the liver and spleen. However, the distinction between unusual cases of advanced stage LPHL and T cell histiocyte rich large B cell lymphoma can be difficult, as the tumor cells in these two disorders have similar immunophenotypes. The lymphocyte rich subtype of classic Hodgkin lymphoma is usually more easily distinguished by expression of markers that are specific for classic forms of Hodgkin lymphoma, such as CD15 and CD30, and the presence of Epstein-Barr virus, which can be detected in 40 percent of lymphocyte rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma, but is not associated with T cell histiocyte rich large B cell lymphoma. (See  \"Hodgkin lymphoma: Epidemiology and risk factors\".)\n【43】 A potentially related issue is the occurrence of composite tumors containing areas of classic Hodgkin lymphoma and areas of DLBCL. Similarly, there may be sequential occurrence of both of these tumor types at different times in a patient's course; this situation arises most often in patients with primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma, which shares certain genetic and immunophenotypic features with classical Hodgkin lymphoma. (See  \"Primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma\".)\n【44】 Anaplastic large cell lymphoma — Cases of the anaplastic variant of DLBCL are morphologically identical to those of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) T/null-cell type and strongly express CD30 (Ki-1). The key diagnostic criterion for such cases is the expression of B cell antigens, which are absent in ALCL. (See  \"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL)\".)\n【45】 Histologic transformation — A subset of patients with pathologic findings consistent with DLBCL will have had a previously undiagnosed indolent lymphoma (eg, follicular lymphoma) that has undergone histologic transformation. Such patients may have a history of waxing and waning lymphadenopathy, with a more recent rapid progression of lymphadenopathy, infiltration of extranodal sites, development of systemic symptoms, and/or elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).\n【46】 Histology can vary greatly in different sections of the same lymph node. As such, careful examination of the sampled lymph node is key to determining whether a component of DLBCL is present. Discordant histologic features suggest transformation of a previously undiagnosed indolent lymphoma. As an example, a small B cell proliferation may be identified in the bone marrow in a patient with DLBCL in a lymph node. The detection of areas of DLBCL within the lymph node denotes transformation to an aggressive phase of disease. This subject is discussed in detail separately. (See  \"Histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma\".)\n【47】 Carcinoma — Morphologically, lymph node involvement with carcinoma may resemble DLBCL in that both tumors are comprised of large atypical cells. Carcinoma can be readily distinguished from DLBCL by the presence of cytokeratins and the absence of B cell markers by immunohistochemistry.\n【48】 Melanoma — Both melanoma and DLBCL are comprised of large atypical cells and can involve lymph nodes. However, unlike DLBCL, melanoma stains positively for S100, HMB-45, and/or Melan A and is negative for B cell markers. (See  \"Pathologic characteristics of melanoma\".)\n【49】 DISTINCTIVE DLBCL SUBTYPES AND RELATED ENTITIES\n【50】 T cell histiocyte-rich large B cell lymphoma — All cases of DLBCL have some infiltrating reactive T cells and macrophages (histiocytes), but in some tumors these cells predominate. This is the so-called T cell histiocyte-rich large B cell lymphoma (picture 10). Some experts have suggested that less than 10 percent of the cellularity should be comprised of tumor cells for this diagnosis to be made.\n【51】 In one study of 40 patients with this variant, the median age was 49 years (range: 21 to 87), with a male to female ratio of 2.6:1 [92]. Splenomegaly, bone marrow involvement, and hepatomegaly were present in 60, 43, and 40 percent, respectively. The International Prognostic Index (IPI) (table 3) was ≥2 in 77 percent of the patients. Neoplastic cells were uniformly positive for CD20 and negative for CD5, CD10, CD15, and CD138. Despite their relatively young age and the use of combination chemotherapy, complete remissions were attained in only 40 percent, with an overall survival of 50 percent at three years. On multivariate analysis, only the IPI and loss-of-function mutations (eg, deletions or point mutations) in p53 were predictive of failure-free survival. In another report, like primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma, T cell histiocyte-rich large B cell lymphoma had amplification of PDL1 gene in 64 percent of cases, a finding associated with high levels of PD-L1 expression [93].\n【52】 In a separate study, there was no difference in five-year overall survival or event-free survival between this variant and DLBCL when subjects were matched for the prognostic features comprising the IPI [94].\n【53】 Primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma — Primary large B cell lymphoma of the mediastinum is a distinct clinicopathologic entity that arises from the thymic (medullary) B cell. It has clinical and pathologic features that differ from DLBCL. (See  \"Primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma\".)\n【54】 Intravascular large B cell lymphoma — Intravascular large B cell lymphoma, which is almost always of B-cell type (but occasionally of T cell origin [95] and rarely of NK-cell origin), usually presents with disseminated intravascular proliferation of large lymphoid cells involving small blood vessels without an obvious extravascular tumor mass or leukemia (picture 11). This tumor has been variously known as intravascular lymphomatosis, angiotropic large cell lymphoma, and malignant angioendotheliomatosis. The organs most commonly affected are the central nervous system, kidneys, lungs, and skin, but virtually any site may be involved. This disorder is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"Intravascular large cell lymphoma\".)\n【55】 Diffuse large B cell lymphoma, leg type — Diffuse large B cell lymphoma, leg type typically presents as red or bluish (violaceous) nodules or tumors on one or both legs, typically below the knee; 10 to 15 percent will develop outside of the lower extremities. Unlike other cutaneous B cell lymphomas, these tumors frequently disseminate to extracutaneous sites and pursue an aggressive course. DLBCL, leg type is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"Primary cutaneous large B cell lymphoma, leg type\".)\n【56】 Diffuse large B cell lymphoma associated with chronic inflammation — DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation, which is also known as pyothorax-associated DLBCL, typically develops in patients with a lengthy (eg, several decades) history of pyothorax; similar tumors may arise at other sites of chronic inflammation [96]. These tumors are uniformly Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive and are believed to arise from post-germinal center B cells that are latently infected with EBV.\n【57】 The tumors often exhibit EBV latency III patterns of gene expression (LMP1 and EBNA2 are expressed), which has been taken to mean that the tumors arise in the context of local immunosuppression within the sites of chronic inflammation. DLBCL associated with chronic inflammation occurs worldwide, but it appears to be more common in Japan and China. In some large series, it is clinically aggressive, with five-year survival of 20 to 35 percent in the pre-rituximab era of CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) therapy [96].\n【58】 Lymphomatoid granulomatosis — Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is an EBV-positive large B cell lymphoma with a T cell-rich background that is clinically and pathologically distinct from DLBCL [3,97].\n【59】 Patients with lymphomatoid granulomatosis typically present with cough (60 percent), fever (60 percent), rash/nodules (40 percent), malaise (35 percent), weight loss (35 percent), neurological abnormalities (30 percent), dyspnea (30 percent), or chest pain (15 percent) [98]. Extranodal disease is common. Most patients have lung involvement at some point during their clinical course. Other commonly involved sites include the kidney, liver, brain, and skin. Lymph nodes and spleen are very rarely involved. Evidence of past or present immunodeficiency may be found.\n【60】 Histologically, the infiltrates show extensive necrosis, often with only a few atypical large B cells in a pleomorphic background of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes; the infiltrate may be both angiocentric and angioinvasive. The large atypical B cells are the neoplastic component and are latently infected with EBV. Pulmonary nodules may exhibit central necrosis and cavitation. (See  \"Pulmonary lymphomatoid granulomatosis\".)\n【61】 Although the infiltrates may resemble those of nasal/angiocentric lymphoma, there is no biological and little clinical overlap, since the latter is an NK cell or T cell neoplasm that involves the upper airway and midfacial region, skin, and sometimes the gastrointestinal tract, and rarely the lung or central nervous system. (See  \"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type\".)\n【62】 EBV-positive DLBCL, NOS — EBV-positive DLBCL, not otherwise specified (NOS), is a variant of DLBCL that replaced EBV-positive DLBCL of the elderly in the 2017 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, based on the recognition that it may occur in people of any age [2,3]. This is a clonal B cell lymphoproliferative disorder seen in patients without known immunodeficiency or prior lymphoma. It is differentiated from EBV-positive lymphomatoid granulomatosis (described above) based on morphology, as the EBV-positive neoplastic cells make up a major fraction of the tumor cellularity in EBV-positive DLBCL and are uncommon in EBV-positive lymphomatoid granulomatosis.\n【63】 This entity is most common in Asian countries, where it accounts for 8 to 10 percent of DLBCL among patients without a known immunodeficiency [99-102]. Most patients present with extranodal disease, with or without nodal involvement.\n【64】 While the initial reports were in adults >50 years old, this entity has been increasingly recognized in younger patients [100,103,104]. One report described the occurrence of EBV-positive DLBCL in young patients (median age 23 years) without evidence of immunodeficiency [103]. EBV-positive tumor cells in these cases expressed the immune checkpoint marker PDL-1 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that participates in metabolic pathways implicated in induction of immune tolerance, both of which may contribute to \"escape\" of EBV-positive tumor cells from immune surveillance. (See 'Lymphomatoid granulomatosis' above.)\n【65】 EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer — EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer is considered a provisional entity in the 2017 revision of the WHO classification [2,3]. It is defined by the presence of isolated, circumscribed, ulcerative lesions, typically occurring in elderly individuals, sometimes in the setting of immunosuppression [105,106]. The lesions are most common in the oropharynx but may also occur in the skin or in the gastrointestinal tract. The lesions contain a polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate mixed with scattered EBV-infected B cells, which frequently include cells resembling Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg cells morphologically and immunophenotypically. The entity is distinguished from Hodgkin lymphoma by its extranodal presentation and retention of B cell markers on the tumor cells in most cases. Although the degree of cytologic atypia in the EBV-positive lesional cells is often striking, raising the possibility of EBV-positive DLBCL, this entity follows a benign course, with frequent spontaneous regressions and excellent responses to conservative treatment.\n【66】 SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See  \"Society guideline links: Lymphoma diagnosis and staging\" and  \"Society guideline links: Management of diffuse large B cell lymphoma\".)\n【67】 INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS — UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, \"The Basics\" and \"Beyond the Basics.\" The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10th to 12th grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【68】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

concurrent therapy with strong cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors (eg, itraconazole, ketoconazole), except ritonavir; acute narrow angle glaucoma.\n【73】 Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.\n【74】 Warnings/Precautions\n【75】 • Sleep-related activities: Hazardous sleep-related activities such as sleep-driving, cooking and eating food, and making phone calls while asleep have been noted with benzodiazepines (Dolder 2008).\n【76】 • Depression: Avoid use in patients with depression because of concerns about worsening mood symptoms, particularly if suicidal risk may be present, except for acute or emergency situations (eg, acute agitation, status epilepticus) (Craske 2022).\n【77】 • Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment.\n【78】 • Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment or predisposition to urate nephropathy; has weak uricosuric properties.\n【79】 • Respiratory disease: Reduce dose or avoid use in patients with respiratory disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or sleep apnea. Benzodiazepines may cause significant respiratory depression.\n【80】 • Flumazenil: Flumazenil may cause withdrawal in patients receiving long-term benzodiazepine therapy.\n【81】 • Debilitated patients: Use with caution in debilitated patients; use lower starting dose.\n【82】 • Older adult patients: Older adults may be at an increased risk of death with use; risk has been found highest within the first 4 months of use in elderly dementia patients (Jennum 2015; Saarelainen 2018).\n【83】 • Fall risk: Use with extreme caution in patients who are at risk of falls; benzodiazepines have been associated with falls and traumatic injury (Nelson 1999).\n【84】 • Obese patients: Use with caution in obese patients; may have prolonged action when discontinued.\n【85】 • Smokers: Cigarette smoking may decrease alprazolam concentrations up to 50%.\n【86】 • Abuse, misuse, and substance use disorder: Counsel patients at increased risk on proper use and monitoring for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and substance use disorder. Institute early treatment or refer patients in whom substance use disorder is suspected. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required.\n【87】 • Appropriate use: Does not have analgesic, antidepressant, or antipsychotic properties.\n【88】 • Breakthrough anxiety: At the end of dosing interval, breakthrough anxiety may occur.\n【89】 • Tolerance: Alprazolam has a short half-life for a benzodiazepine and the duration of action after a single dose is determined by redistribution rather than metabolism. Tolerance does not develop to the anxiolytic effects (Vinkers 2012). Chronic use of this agent may increase the perioperative benzodiazepine dose needed to achieve desired effect.\n【90】 Dosage Forms: US\n【91】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【92】 Concentrate, Oral:\n【93】 ALPRAZolam Intensol: 1 mg/mL (30 mL) [unflavored flavor]\n【94】 Tablet, Oral:\n【95】 Xanax: 0.25 mg [scored]\n【96】 Xanax: 0.5 mg [scored; contains fd&c yellow #6 (sunset yellow)]\n【97】 Xanax: 1 mg [scored; contains fd&c blue #2 (indigotine,indigo carmine)]\n【98】 Xanax: 2 mg [scored]\n【99】 Generic: 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg\n【100】 Tablet Disintegrating, Oral:\n【101】 Tablet Extended Release 24 Hour, Oral:\n【102】 ALPRAZolam XR: 0.5 mg\n【103】 ALPRAZolam XR: 1 mg [contains quinoline yellow (d&c yellow #10)]\n【104】 ALPRAZolam XR: 2 mg [contains fd&c blue #2 (indigotine,indigo carmine)]\n【105】 ALPRAZolam XR: 3 mg [contains fd&c blue #2 (indigotine,indigo carmine), quinoline yellow (d&c yellow #10)]\n【106】 Xanax XR: 0.5 mg\n【107】 Xanax XR: 1 mg [contains quinoline yellow (d&c yellow #10)]\n【108】 Xanax XR: 2 mg [contains fd&c blue #2 (indigotine,indigo carmine)]\n【109】 Xanax XR: 3 mg [contains fd&c blue #2 (indigotine,indigo carmine), quinoline yellow (d&c yellow #10)]\n【110】 Generic: 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 3 mg\n【111】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【112】 May be product dependent\n【113】 Pricing: US\n【114】 1 mg/mL (per mL): $3.66\n【115】 0.5 mg (per each): $2.15 - $2.26\n【116】 1 mg (per each): $2.67 - $2.81\n【117】 2 mg (per each): $3.55 - $3.73\n【118】 3 mg (per each): $5.32 - $5.59\n【119】 0.5 mg (per each): $12.00\n【120】 1 mg (per each): $14.93\n【121】 2 mg (per each): $19.82\n【122】 3 mg (per each): $29.72\n【123】 0.25 mg (per each): $1.52 - $2.18\n【124】 0.5 mg (per each): $1.89 - $2.72\n【125】 1 mg (per each): $2.52 - $3.63\n【126】 2 mg (per each): $4.29 - $6.17\n【127】 0.25 mg (per each): $0.60 - $0.70\n【128】 0.5 mg (per each): $0.76 - $0.93\n【129】 1 mg (per each): $0.96 - $1.16\n【130】 2 mg (per each): $1.69 - $1.96\n【131】 0.25 mg (per each): $6.23\n【132】 0.5 mg (per each): $7.76\n【133】 1 mg (per each): $10.35\n【134】 2 mg (per each): $17.60\n【135】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【136】 Xanax: 0.25 mg [contains corn starch, docusate sodium/sodium benzoate]\n【137】 Xanax: 0.5 mg [contains corn starch, docusate sodium/sodium benzoate, fd&c yellow #5 (tartrazine)aluminum lake, fd&c yellow #6(sunset yellow)alumin lake, quinoline (d&c yellow #10) aluminum lake]\n【138】 Xanax: 1 mg [contains corn starch, docusate sodium/sodium benzoate, fd&c blue #1 (brill blue) aluminum lake, fd&c blue #2 (indigo carm) aluminum lake]\n【139】 Xanax TS: 2 mg [contains corn starch, docusate sodium/sodium benzoate]\n【140】 Controlled Substance\n【141】 C-IV\n【142】 Administration: Adult\n【143】 IR preparations: May be administered sublingually if oral administration is not possible; absorption and onset of effect are comparable to oral administration (Ref)\n【144】 ER tablet: Should be taken once daily in the morning; do not crush, break, or chew.\n【145】 Bariatric surgery: Some institutions may have specific protocols that conflict with these recommendations; refer to institutional protocols as appropriate.

Tmax is decreased 33% when food is given immediately prior to dose and increased by 33% when food is given ≥1 hour after dose. Management: Administer without regard to food.\n【268】 Reproductive Considerations\n【269】 Amenorrhea and galactorrhea were observed in a patient following self-medication with high doses of alprazolam (alprazolam extended release 3 mg and alprazolam 5 to 6 mg daily for several months). Following a tapered withdrawal of alprazolam, prolactin levels returned to normal, regular menstrual cycles resumed, and galactorrhea resolved (Petric 2011).\n【270】 Therapy for anxiety should be individualized (BAP [McAllister-Williams 2017]); avoid the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety disorders in patients planning to become pregnant (Larsen 2015).\n【271】 Alprazolam can be detected in seminal fluid; however, alterations of the seminal profile (eg, sperm concentration, motility) were not observed in 4 patients evaluated (Mazzilli 2021).\n【272】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【273】 Alprazolam and its metabolites cross the human placenta (García-Algar 2007).\n【274】 In utero exposure to benzodiazepines has the potential to cause harm to the fetus. Teratogenic effects have been observed in some studies; however, a clear association has not been reported and additional data are needed (Bellantuono 2013; Freeman 2018; Grigoriadis 2019; Noh 2022; Szpunar 2022; Tinker 2019; Wikner 2007). Exposure to a benzodiazepine late in pregnancy may cause neonatal sedation (hypotonia, lethargy, and respiratory depression) and/or symptoms of neonatal withdrawal (feeding difficulties, hyperreflexia, inconsolable crying, irritability, restlessness, and tremors). Data related to long-term effects on neurodevelopment are inconclusive (Chen 2022; Radojčić 2017; Sundbakk 2022; Wang 2022). Newborns exposed to alprazolam in utero should be monitored for feeding problems, respiratory depression, sedation, and withdrawal.\n【275】 Therapy for anxiety during pregnancy should be individualized. Untreated or inadequately treated psychiatric illness may lead to poor adherence to prenatal care and adverse pregnancy outcomes (ACOG 2008). Benzodiazepines are not preferred when pharmacologic treatment for anxiety disorders is needed during pregnancy (BAP [McAllister-Williams 2017]; Larsen 2015) and when a benzodiazepine is needed, the use of alprazolam is not preferred. If possible, avoid scheduled doses of benzodiazepines in the month prior to delivery to reduce the risk of withdrawal symptoms in the newborn (Larsen 2015).\n【276】 Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to alprazolam is ongoing. Health care providers are encouraged to enroll patients exposed to alprazolam during pregnancy in the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications (1-866-961-2388).\n【277】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【278】 Alprazolam is present in breast milk.\n【279】 Data related to the presence of alprazolam in breast milk are available:\n【280】 • Following administration of a single oral dose of alprazolam 0.5 mg to 8 patients, 6 to 28 weeks postpartum, peak breast milk concentrations of alprazolam occurred at ~1 hour and the half-life was ~14 hours; metabolites were not detected. Peak breast milk concentrations of alprazolam (3.7 ± 1.59 ng/mL) were ~60% lower than the peak maternal serum concentration. Authors of the study calculated the relative infant dose (RID) of alprazolam via breast milk to be 3% of the weight-adjusted maternal dose (Oo 1995).\n【281】 • Breast milk was collected from 2 patients, 3 to 6 days postpartum, who had been taking alprazolam during pregnancy and after delivery. Breast milk was sampled 2 hours after the maternal dose, approximately when the peak maternal plasma concentration occurs. The first patient was taking alprazolam 0.8 mg/day; the peak breast milk concentration of alprazolam was 3.4 ng/mL. The second patient was taking alprazolam 2.4 mg/day, providing a peak breast milk concentration of 24.5 ng/mL. The authors of the study calculated the RID of alprazolam via breast milk, compared to the weight-adjusted maternal dose, 2 different ways: first by using the actual amount of breast milk ingested, then by using a theoretical milk intake of 150 mL/kg/day (the average amount ingested by an exclusively breastfed infant). For the first case, the RID of alprazolam was 2% (based on actual intake) compared to 3.8% (theoretical intake). For the second case, the postpartum RID of alprazolam was 7.3% (based on actual intake) compared to 9.3% (theoretical intake). The first patient also had breast milk sampled 1.5 hours after a maternal dose of 1 mg/day at the 1-month postpartum visit. Alprazolam concentrations in breast milk at this time were 5.42 ng/mL and the RID was calculated to be 5.3% (actual intake) and 4.6% (theoretical intake) (Nishimura 2021).\n【282】 • In general, breastfeeding is considered acceptable when the RID of a medication is <10% (Anderson 2016; Ito 2000). However, some sources note breastfeeding should only be considered if the RID is <5% for psychotropic agents (Larsen 2015).\n【283】 Drowsiness, lethargy, or weight loss in breastfeeding infants has been observed in case reports following maternal use of some benzodiazepines (Iqbal 2002). Case reports have noted drowsiness (Ito 1993) or CNS depression (Kelly 2012) in infants exposed to alprazolam while breastfeeding. Symptoms of withdrawal were described in an infant following alprazolam exposure in utero and via breast milk (Anderson 1989).\n【284】 Breastfeeding during benzodiazepine therapy is not recommended due to the potential for drowsiness in the breastfeeding infant (Larsen 2015); breastfeeding during alprazolam therapy is not recommended by the manufacturer. If a benzodiazepine is needed in breastfeeding patients, use of a short-acting agent is preferred (WHO 2002).\n【285】 Dietary Considerations\n【286】 Orally-disintegrating tablets may contain phenylalanine.\n【287】 Monitoring Parameters\n【288】 Respiratory and cardiovascular status; mental alertness; assess risk for abuse, misuse, and substance use disorder.\n【289】 Mechanism of Action\n【290】 Short-acting benzodiazepine (Griffin 2013). Binds to stereospecific benzodiazepine receptors on the postsynaptic GABA neuron at several sites within the central nervous system, including the limbic system, reticular formation. Enhancement of the inhibitory effect of GABA on neuronal excitability results by increased neuronal membrane permeability to chloride ions. This shift in chloride ions results in hyperpolarization (a less excitable state) and stabilization. Benzodiazepine receptors and effects appear to be linked to the GABA-A receptors. Benzodiazepines do not bind to GABA-B receptors.\n【291】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【292】 Absorption: Readily absorbed; Extended release: Slower relative to immediate release formulation resulting in a concentration that is maintained 5 to 11 hours after dosing; rate increased following night time dosing (versus morning dosing).\n【293】 Duration of action: Adults: Classified as a short-acting benzodiazepine; classification based on benzodiazepines with half-life between 1 and 12 hours (Griffin 2013).\n【294】 Distribution: Immediate release: Vd: 0.84 to 1.42 L/kg (Greenblatt 1993).\n【295】 Protein binding: 80%; primarily to albumin.\n【296】 Metabolism: Hepatic via CYP3A4; forms two active metabolites (4-hydroxyalprazolam and α-hydroxyalprazolam [about half as active as alprazolam]) and an inactive metabolite benzophenone metabolite, however, the active metabolites are unlikely to contribute to much of the pharmacologic effects because of their low concentrations and lesser potencies.\n【297】 Bioavailability: Immediate release: 84% to 92% (Greenblatt 1993); Extended release: 90%.\n【298】 Half-life elimination:\n【299】 Adults: 11.2 hours (Immediate release range: 6.3 to 26.9 hours; Extended release range: 10.7 to 15.8 hours); Orally-disintegrating tablet: Mean: 12.5 hours (range: 7.9 to 19.2 hours).\n【300】 Alcoholic liver disease: 19.7 hours (range: 5.8 to 65.3 hours).\n【301】 Obesity: 21.8 hours (range: 9.9 to 40.4 hours).\n【302】 Elderly: 16.3 hours (range: 9 to 26.9 hours).\n【303】 Time to peak, serum:\n【304】 Immediate release: 1 to 2 hours.\n【305】 Extended release: Adolescents and Adults: ~9 hours, relatively steady from 4 to 12 hours (Glue 2006); decreased by 1 hour when administered at bedtime (as compared to morning administration); decreased by 33% when administered with a high-fat meal; increased by 33% when administered ≥1 hour after a high-fat meal.\n【306】 Orally-disintegrating tablet: 1.5 to 2 hours; occurs ~15 minutes earlier when administered with water; increased to ~4 hours when administered with a high-fat meal.\n【307】 Excretion: Urine (as unchanged drug and metabolites).\n【308】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【309】 Race/ethnicity: Maximal concentrations and half-life are approximately 15% and 25% higher in Asians.\n【310】 Cigarette smoking: Concentrations may be reduced by up to 50% in smokers.\n【311】 Brand Names: International\n【312】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Alprazolam  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/alprazolam-drug-information?search=%E5%B8%B8%E6%9F%93%E8%89%B2%E4%BD%93%E6%98%BE%E6%80%A7%E9%81%97%E4%BC%A0%E6%80%A7%E7%97%89%E6%8C%9B%E6%80%A7%E6%88%AA%E7%98%AB&source=search_result&selectedTitle=35%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

Some studies have shown an association between first trimester systemic corticosteroid use and oral clefts; however, information is conflicting and may be influenced by maternal dose, duration/frequency of exposure, and indication for use. Additional data are needed to evaluate any potential risk of systemic corticosteroids and other adverse pregnancy outcomes (eg, gestational diabetes mellitus, low birth weight, preeclampsia, preterm birth) (ACOG 2019; Bandoli 2017; Lunghi 2010; Skuladottir 2014).

{"seq_id": 12092, "text": "url: http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/death-certificates-and-death-investigations-in-the-united-states?search=%E8%B5%B7%E6%BA%90%E4%BA%8E%E5%9B%B4%E7%94%9F%E6%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E7%BA%B5%E9%9A%94%E6%B0%94%E8%82%BF&source=search_result&selectedTitle=129%7E150&usage_type=default\n【0】 Death certificates and death investigations in the United States\n【1】 INTRODUCTION — Death certificate completion and appropriate medical examiner involvement after death are important components of patient care. Training in proper death certificate completion is likely inadequate or may be completely lacking, and mistakes are common. This has implications for the individual and for accurate monitoring of mortality data. This topic will provide education on correctly completing a death certificate and describe the role of the medical examiner/coroner in death investigations.\n【2】 PURPOSE OF THE DEATH CERTIFICATE — The death certificate serves three basic purposes [1]:\n【3】 ●It documents a death (registration process)\n【4】 ●It provides an opinion regarding the cause, circumstances, and manner of death (certification process)\n【5】 ●It provides information that may be used for public health benefits\n【6】 HOW TO COMPLETE A DEATH CERTIFICATE — The information below is relevant to United States death certificates, and an example of which is provided in the graphic (form 1).\n【7】 Components — The death certificate contains medical information, (which is authored by medical providers, medical examiners, or coroners), and information regarding patient demographics, ancestry, and the disposition of remains (eg, cremation, burial), which is filled out by a funeral director.\n【8】 Medical information — The medical information includes the pronouncement of death as well as the medical certification of the cause of death. The location of the death dictates who will complete the medical information section of the certificate. In general, after a natural death in a medical facility, this section would be completed by the treating physician or advanced practitioner. After a natural home death, it may be completed by the primary care physician. Some death certificates occurring in either location, however, must be completed by a medical examiner/coroner. (See 'Deaths reportable to medical examiner/coroner' below.)\n【9】 Pronouncement — This information is completed by a person with medical training who is capable of determining death (eg, nurses, APRNs, PAs, MD/DO, medical examiner/coroner). For out-of-hospital deaths, an emergency medicine physician may pronounce death over the phone in consultation with emergency medical services or paramedics.\n【10】 Medical certification of death — The medical cause of death section of the certificate has two components: the cause of death (Part 1) and contributing conditions (Part 2) [13]. Not every death will have a Part 2. These must be completed by a MD/DO or medical examiner/coroner. An APRN, PA, or a nurse also may complete the certificate if a doctor has issued an order allowing them to do so.\n【11】 Documenting the cause of death — A misconception among many clinicians is that they must be 100 percent certain of the cause to certify the death. This is never the case. For a natural death, the required degree of certainty is a medical probability, that is to say: more likely than not, this person died of this disease. The cause of death is an opinion based upon the available medical history information, risk factors for disease, and circumstances.\n【12】 ●Mechanism\n【13】 ●Immediate cause\n【14】 ●Underlying cause of death\n【15】 ●Mechanism – Mechanisms of death are the alterations of physiology and biochemistry whereby the underlying causes exert their lethal effects. These mechanisms are never etiologically specific and cannot stand by themselves on a death certificate. They are caused by a variety of diseases and injuries. Examples include disseminated intravascular coagulation, sepsis, cardiac arrhythmias, acidosis, asphyxiation, and exsanguination.\n【16】 ●Immediate cause – Immediate causes of death are complications of the underlying cause interposed between the underlying cause and fatal result. There may be one or more immediate causes, and they may occur over a brief or prolonged interval, but none absolves the underlying cause of its ultimate responsibility. Similar to mechanisms, immediate causes are not etiologically specific and cannot stand alone on the death certificate. Examples include bronchopneumonia, acute pancreatitis, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarct, and pulmonary thromboembolism.\n【17】 ●Underlying cause – The underlying cause of death is the etiologically specific disease (and/or injury) that started the lethal sequence of events. It is defined as that which, in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, produces the fatality, and without which the death would not have occurred. The underlying cause should be thought of as a \"codeable\" disease, a disease in the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) [14]. Examples include atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, colonic adenocarcinoma, senile or Alzheimer-type dementia, and pulmonary emphysema.\n【18】 Contributing conditions — Some deaths, but certainly not all, have a contributing condition, and these are important to include [3,15]. An example of a contributing condition is pulmonary emphysema in a person who dies of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In this instance, the lung disease likely caused a physiologic condition that exacerbated the cardiac disease. By contrast, an example of a disease that would not qualify as a contributing condition in this patient might be arthritis. Contributing conditions can be general (eg, cirrhosis of the liver, anemia, aortic stenosis, chronic kidney disease) or may be etiologically specific diseases (eg, diabetes mellitus, obesity).\n【19】 COVID-19 documentation — Accurate and timely death certification of COVID-19 deaths was an important part of understanding the pandemic and remains important [16,17]. The CDC provides information on how to certify these deaths.\n【20】 Common mistakes/misconceptions — Errors on death certificates are common [4,9,10,18-29]. Several are described below:\n【21】 ●Lack of logical flow – The death certificate has four lines to organize the flow of the cause of death statement (mechanism, immediate cause, underlying cause, and contributing conditions), each of which should relate to one another in a logical way. They are not four separate lines for four separate distinct disease processes without a pathophysiologic connection. The certificate is meant to have the most important/underlying condition on the bottom-most line. However, there is a tendency to put the most important diagnosis first (eg, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease due to myocardial infarct). This is the \"cart before the horse\" error and results in a logic error when one considers the \"due to\" phrasing. The death certificate is read from the top to bottom, with each line connected by a \"due to\"; therefore, the four lines need to all relate to one another within a single disease process or continuum. It is important for this to be understood as those lines of text are converted to codes by vital record agencies.\n【22】 ●Writing more than is needed – It is not necessary to use all four lines. The most important (underlying) cause needs to be on the bottom-most line, often the only line that is utilized in some cases (eg, hypertensive cardiovascular disease).\n【23】 ●Not recognizing the underlying cause – All certificates must report an underlying cause of death, but some clinicians mistake an immediate cause for an underlying one. An example of this would be if the death certificate only lists acute bronchopneumonia, which is an immediate cause of death which requires an underlying cause. Bronchopneumonia is a patchy consolidation involving one or more lobes contrasted with a lobar pneumonia involving an entire lobe. It is not an etiologically specific cause because many diseases may lead to it; to make this a correct certificate, there needs to be documentation of underlying cause of the bronchopneumonia (eg, SARS-CoV-2 [COVID-19] respiratory infection, pulmonary emphysema, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma). It should be noted that a lobar pneumonia (a typical pneumococcal pneumonia) is a different disease process than a bronchopneumonia. Lobar pneumonia can occur without any underlying health condition, and so it may stand alone on the death certificate.\n【24】 Two other examples in which the certifier may neglect to include an underlying cause of death are myocardial infarcts and end-stage kidney disease. The reason for the myocardial infarct must be listed, and although most myocardial infarcts are due to coronary artery atherosclerosis, some may be due to a vasculitis or stimulant abuse. For end-stage kidney disease, the underlying disease (eg, diabetes, hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus) must be included.\n【25】 ●Inappropriate use of cardiopulmonary arrest – Cardiopulmonary (or cardiac or respiratory) arrest continues to be listed as the cause of death on death certificates. Cardiopulmonary arrest simply means the heart and lungs have stopped. It is a synonym for death and is redundant to list it in the cause of death statement. Every death, no matter the cause, results in a cardiopulmonary arrest. The question is, what is the disease that caused the cardiopulmonary arrest? Specific cardiac arrhythmias also are not accurate causes of death. Asystole and ventricular fibrillation essentially occur with every death. On the standard United States death certificate, it states: \"DO NOT enter terminal events such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, or ventricular fibrillation without showing the etiology.\" The cause of death needs to be a specific disease entity that caused the arrhythmia.\n【26】 ●Misuse of contributory conditions – Contributory conditions are not meant to be a problem list, a place for unusual or interesting diagnoses, or a notation of a patient's medical history. These conditions are listed only if they have made a physiologic contribution to the death.\n【27】 Manner of death — The manner of death is an explanation of how the cause arose or the circumstances for how an injury occurred. The choices for the manners of death are natural, accident, suicide, homicide, undetermined, and therapeutic complication (in some parts of the United States). Natural deaths are those caused exclusively (100 percent) by disease or old age. A natural death certificate can be issued by a medical practitioner.\n【28】 Required questions (pregnancy, tobacco, work-related) — The National Center for Health Statistics often recommends that certain risk factors or states be tracked on death certificates. Currently there are questions that ask whether or not tobacco contributed to the death (acceptable answers include “unknown” or “probably”), if the person was pregnant at or within a year of the death, whether or not an autopsy was performed, and whether a work-related injury resulted in the death.\n【29】 Demographics/vital records — This section is completed by the funeral director during an interview with the next of kin. The demographic information typically includes legal name, sex, date of birth, birthplace, residence at time of death, marital status, parents' names, occupation, veteran status, educational level, Social Security number, and the name of the informant. The disposition of the remains is notated as burial, cremation, anatomic gift, or burial at sea, and the name of funeral home, embalmer, and site of crematory or cemetery are listed. The date of final disposition also is included.\n【30】 Deaths reportable to medical examiner/coroner — Deaths that are reportable to the governmental medicolegal death investigation authority (either the medical examiner or coroner) vary slightly by jurisdiction [33]. Physicians and advanced practitioners should consult with their local health department to learn of the medical examiner/coroner reporting requirements. These requirements are published in statutes and regulations within local health codes. Additionally, most hospitals have instructions accessible for reporting deaths to the medical examiner/coroner.\n【31】 ●Accidents, suicides, homicides\n【32】 ●Poisoning, drug intoxication\n【33】 ●Disease with potential public health threat (as determined by local health departments)\n【34】 ●Deaths resulting from employment\n【35】 ●Sudden and unexpected deaths not caused by a readily recognized disease\n【36】 ●Death related to medical or surgical complications\n【37】 ●Suspicious and unnatural deaths\n【38】 ●Deaths of individuals in police custody\n【39】 ●Deaths occurring outside of a medical care setting (excluding home hospice deaths without any recent injury, eg, a fall)\n【40】 ●Deaths of persons who are not under the care of a physician (unattended deaths)\n【41】 ●Asphyxia\n【42】 ●Choking\n【43】 ●Hyperthermia\n【44】 ●Hypothermia\n【45】 ●Subarachnoid hemorrhage\n【46】 ●Subdural hematoma\n【47】 ●Thermal/chemical burns\n【48】 ●Epidural hematoma\n【49】 ●Exsanguination\n【50】 ●Fall\n【51】 ●Fracture\n【52】 ●Drug or alcohol overdose\n【53】 ●Drug abuse\n【54】 ●Intoxication\n【55】 ●Poisoning\n【56】 ●Anaphylaxis (this term may be related to a medication reaction [complication of therapy] or due to a bee sting [injury])\n【57】 CONSIDERATIONS FOR SPECIAL POPULATIONS — Deaths that occur in these situations or among these patients may have unique considerations for medical providers:\n【58】 ●In the home – Primary care providers may be contacted by a funeral director when a patient dies at home. The medical history and risk factors (eg, smoking, obesity) are considered and a death certificate may be issued. The police will have responded to the scene of death and the medical examiner likely will have been notified and declined further investigation. Those factors should reassure the doctor that suspicious circumstances and trauma have been excluded. The cause of death can be completed remembering the probability standard, more likely than not this patient died of an etiologically specific disease.\n【59】 ●In the hospital – Hospital-based physicians are frequently asked to issue death certificates. They should consider the original reason for admission to the hospital and verify that it was not due to trauma or intoxication. If the hospital course was all for the management of underling medical disease, then the death certificate can be issued with that specific disease entity as the underlying cause of death.\n【60】 ●Following surgery – The certifying surgeon needs to be mindful of the underlying reason for the surgery (eg, abscess due to perforation by colonic diverticulitis). This disease (or injury) is the underlying cause of death. The surgeon also needs to evaluate whether or not the surgical interventions hastened the death (eg, a complication of a gastrostomy tube placed in preparation for laryngeal cancer chemotherapy). Alternatively, if an individual is admitted with a subdural hematoma from a fall and undergoes craniotomy and later dies, that death is the sequelae of the fall, a traumatic injury, and is reportable to the medical examiner/coroner.\n【61】 ●In the emergency department – A death in the emergency department may be due to both natural and/or unnatural causes. The first layer of scrutiny is whether or not an injury or intoxication may have played a role in the death. If so, it must be reported to the medical examiner/coroner. If a recent or remote injury or intoxication did not contribute, then the death is due to a medical condition. The medical history and risk factors are considered in determining the cause of death.\n【62】 ●In skilled nursing facilities – It is critical for the skilled nursing facility death certifier to consider the patient's full medical history. For example, it is not uncommon for an older adult to have sustained a fall with a hip fracture or subdural hemorrhage and then die a few weeks later in a nursing home. In this example, an injury has contributed to the death and the death certificate must be reported to the medical examiner/coroner. In order to invoke an injury on the death certificate, there must be a direct pathophysiologic link between the event and the death that demonstrates the injury a contributed to the death (eg, a fracture causing a pulmonary thromboembolism). There is no time limit between the injury and cause of death, and the interval may extend for years (eg, urosepsis-complicating paraplegia due to a remote gunshot wound of the spine). When in doubt, it is best to consult with the medical examiner/coroner prior to filling out the certificate.\n【63】 ●Pregnant patients – The death of a pregnant or postpartum patient is uncommon. If the death involves a placental abruption and hemorrhage or uterine \"rupture\" an underlying traumatic injury or cocaine use must be considered. Those scenarios are reportable to the medical examiner/coroner.\n【64】 ●Children – Children die most commonly of acute traumatic, congenital, or oncologic causes. Deaths due to acute or remote trauma or due to suspected neglect are reportable to the medical examiner/coroner.\n【65】 MEDICAL EXAMINER INVESTIGATIONS — The medical examiner/coroner receives reports of death from medical caregivers (eg, hospitals, nursing homes, hospice) and also from police departments or funeral directors for deaths occurring outside of a medical setting. The reports of death are made based on the statutory requirements outlined above (see 'Deaths reportable to medical examiner/coroner' above). Following the report of death, the medical examiner/coroner will determine the type of investigation that will follow. A forensic pathologist is the medical specialist who performs the autopsy and investigation. Medicolegal death investigators are professionals who assist the medical examiner/coroner by performing scene investigations, triaging cases, obtaining medical records, etc. The medical examiner/coroner also may employ a telecommunications staff to obtain and accession the initial case information during the telephone report of death.\n【66】 Scene investigation — For a death outside of a medical setting (eg, home, highway, railroad tracks, sidewalk), a representative from the medical examiner/coroner usually will visit the scene to examine the body and look for details pertinent to the death investigation (eg, drug paraphernalia, suicide notes, medication bottles). The body may then be transported to the medical examiner/coroner facility for further examination/autopsy.\n【67】 Hospital deaths — The medical examiner/coroner telecommunications person and/or medicolegal death investigator will acquire all the demographic information and details of hospital course, and they may ask for additional medical records. The medical examiner/coroner will determine if the body needs to be transported to their facility for an autopsy. Sometimes in delayed traumatic deaths, if the hospital staff adequately document the injuries, and there is no suggestion of criminality, the medical examiner/coroner may issue the death certificate and the body can be released to the funeral home. The medical examiner/coroner will usually give the reported death a unique medical examiner/coroner case number.\n【68】 Autopsy — An autopsy is an examination of the body after death. It includes an external examination looking for signs of injury or disease, an in situ examination of the organs and the state of the body cavities, and then an organ by organ gross and even microscopic examination looking for disease and injury [6,26,35]. Not all medical examiner/coroner deaths will undergo an autopsy. Some may have only an external examination or medical record review depending on the history and circumstances. Autopsy reports are available to family members, treating physicians and law enforcement agents.\n【69】 Toxicology — Specimens are routinely collected for toxicological testing. The typical samples are peripheral blood, heart blood, vitreous fluid, urine, gastric contents, brain, and liver tissue. If a hospitalized patient dies several days after admission, the medical examiner/coroner will contact the hospital lab and request that the original fluid samples be put on hold. Those samples are the most relevant to investigation to determine if the patient was intoxicated at the time of injury or if the death was caused by intoxication [36-40].\n【70】 Infant deaths — Sudden unexpected infant deaths must be reported to the medical examiner/coroner. These comprehensive medicolegal investigations involve an examination of the infant at the hospital, a review of pediatric records and the home environment, an interview with the family and a reenactment of the circumstances under which the infant was last known alive and found, and a complete autopsy with microbiology and toxicology testing, and special procedures as needed. Frequently, the sleep environment is a factor in the cause of such deaths, so the scene examination is imperative [41]. Issues related to sudden infant death are also discussed elsewhere. (See  \"Sudden unexpected infant death including SIDS: Initial management\", section on 'Case investigation'.)\n【71】 In-custody deaths (police/prison) — These are reportable to the medical examiner/coroner even if injury is not evident or suspected [42].\n【72】 Organ donors — The medical examiner/coroner is contacted by tissue and organ procurement organizations prior to donation for certain deaths that fall under the jurisdiction of the medical examiner/coroner (eg, a person with a gunshot wound of the head whose heart is still beating with the assistance of life support). The medical examiner/coroner may restrict certain donations if it interferes with their ability to investigate the death in light of later potential legal proceedings.\n【73】 BURIAL PERMIT/CREMATION — The family of the decedent selects the disposition of the remains and works with the funeral director to facilitate their wishes. If an in-state burial is selected, then a burial permit is issued by the governmental registrar of the death certificate. If an out-of-state disposition is selected, then a transit permit may be required. There are many parts of the country where reciprocity is given to funeral directors working within a region.\n【74】 FLOW OF INFORMATION — Upon completion and registration of a death certificate, the next of kin will need copies of the official death record as proof of death. This allows for leases and utilities to be cancelled, bank accounts to be closed, and other logistical issues to be resolved.\n【75】 PUBLIC HEALTH MONITORING\n【76】 Coding/abstraction — The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) have established various programs to investigate subsets of deaths [14]. The National Violent Death Registry System catalogs certain unnatural deaths and abstracts additional case-related detail [47-49]. The State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System is a similar CDC database that tracks accidental drug intoxication deaths and other case-related detail [49]. Individual states also have databases and methods for using death certificate data for prevention strategies.\n【77】 Examples of how death certificate data are used for harm reduction — The use and benefits of death certificates goes beyond a vital records function [6]. Research directions and funding may be driven by increases and decreases in mortality by various diseases and injuries. Examples include:\n【78】 ●Transportation deaths (eg, seatbelts, airbags, intoxications) [50-59]\n【79】 ●Infant deaths (\"Back to Sleep\"/\"Don’t Shake\" campaigns) [60-64]\n【80】 ●Recalls on medical devices and medications (US Food and Drug Administration MedWatch) [65]\n【81】 ●Epidemiological clustering of disease and unnatural deaths (eg, opioid crisis) [48,66-74]\n【82】 ●Consumer Product Safety Commission recalls on faulty consumer products (eg, faulty cribs) [75]\n【83】 ●Occupational Safety and Health Administration/Department of Labor – Work-related deaths (eg, falls, electrocutions) [76,77]\n【84】 ●Maternal mortality [78-89]\n【85】 Opioid fatalities/harm reduction — By the precise listing of drugs on the death certificate, medical examiners/coroners have helped demonstrate the evolution of the opioid crisis from prescription medications, to heroin, and then fentanyl. The data can be used to track trends in communities and involve local outreach groups. Additionally, there is a program through the CDC to track suspected overdoses in order to act more quickly with deterrents, rescue medications, substance use support organizations, and awareness [68,74,90-92].\n【86】 SUMMARY\n【87】 ●Importance – Death certificate completion, and appropriate medical examiner involvement after death are important components of patient care. Death certificate information is used by government and other agencies for monitoring morbidity and mortality, scientific study, legislative change, research and funding prioritization, public health strategies and public safety initiatives. (See 'Purpose of the death certificate' above and 'Public health monitoring' above.)\n【88】 ●Medical information – The medical information on a death certificate includes the pronouncement of death as well as the medical certification of the cause of death, which has two components: the cause of death (Part 1) and contributing conditions (Part 2) (form 1). (See 'Pronouncement' above and 'Medical certification of death' above and 'Contributing conditions' above.)\n【89】 ●Reporting to the medical examiner/coroner – Deaths that are reportable to the governmental medicolegal death investigation authority (medical examiner/coroner) vary slightly by jurisdiction. Following the report of death, the medical examiner/coroner will determine the type of investigation that will follow. Physicians and advanced practitioners should consult with their local health department to learn of the medical examiner/coroner reporting requirements. (See 'Deaths reportable to medical examiner/coroner' above.)\n【90】 ●Special populations – Deaths that occur in certain situations (eg, in the home, hospital, emergency department, skilled nursing facilities, or after surgery) or among certain patients (eg, pregnant persons or children) may have unique considerations for medical providers.

Consult drug interactions database for more information.\n【61】 Warnings/Precautions\n【62】 • Suicidal thoughts/depression: Suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, and depression have been reported postmarketing; monitor closely.\n【63】 • Bleeding disorders: Use IM injection with caution in patients thrombocytopenia or any bleeding disorder (including hemophilia and severe hepatic failure), or patients on anticoagulant therapy; bleeding/hematoma may occur from IM administration.\n【64】 • Hepatic impairment: Use is not recommended in acute hepatitis or hepatic failure (APA [Reus 2018]).\n【65】 • Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (has not been studied).\n【66】 • Injection: Vehicle used in the injectable naltrexone formulation (polylactide-co-glycolide microspheres) has rarely been associated with retinal artery occlusion in patients with abnormal arteriovenous anastomosis following injection of other drug products that also use the polylactide-co-glycolide microspheres vehicle.\n【67】 • Discontinuation of therapy: There is no maximum recommended duration for maintenance treatment of opioid use disorder; patients may require treatment indefinitely. Advise patients of the potential to relapse to illicit drug use following discontinuation of opioid use disorder treatment (SAMHSA 2021).\n【68】 • Opioid use disorder: Patients should be opioid-free (including tramadol) for a minimum of 7 to 10 days; a naloxone challenge test may be helpful to confirm patient is opioid-free prior to therapy if there is any suspicion since urinary opioid screen may not be sufficient proof. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as 2 weeks. Use of naltrexone does not eliminate or diminish withdrawal symptoms. Oral naltrexone tablets have not been shown to be more effective than placebo for opioid use disorder due to poor patient adherence (SAMHSA 2021).\n【69】 • Emergency pain management: In naltrexone-treated patients requiring emergency pain management, consider alternatives to opioid therapy (eg, regional analgesia, nonopioid analgesics, general anesthesia). If opioid therapy is required for pain therapy, patients should be under the direct care of a trained anesthesia provider.\n【70】 • Naloxone access: Discuss the availability of naloxone with all patients, as well as their caregivers, at initial treatment and regularly during therapy (eg, with each subsequent naltrexone injection). Patients being treated for an opioid use disorder have the potential for relapse and are at risk for opioid overdose; this risk may be increased in patients treated with naltrexone near the end of the naltrexone dosing interval (particularly if using naltrexone injection), if a dose of naltrexone is missed, or when naltrexone treatment is discontinued. Inform patients and caregivers on options for obtaining naloxone (eg, by prescription, directly from a pharmacist, a community-based program) as permitted by state dispensing and prescribing guidelines. Educate patients and caregivers on how to recognize respiratory depression, proper administration of naloxone, and getting emergency help.\n【71】 • Surgery: In patients treated with naltrexone for opioid use disorder who are requiring surgery, discontinue oral naltrexone at least 72 hours before scheduled elective surgery if opioid use is anticipated; extended-release IM naltrexone should be discontinued at least 30 days prior to scheduled surgery (oral naltrexone may be used temporarily) (ASAM 2020).\n【72】 Dosage Forms: US\n【73】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【74】 Suspension Reconstituted, Intramuscular:\n【75】 Vivitrol: 380 mg (1 ea)\n【76】 Tablet, Oral, as hydrochloride:\n【77】 Generic: 50 mg\n【78】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【79】 May be product dependent\n【80】 Pricing: US\n【81】 380 mg (per each): $1,908.26\n【82】 50 mg (per each): $2.14 - $4.28\n【83】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【84】 ReVia: 50 mg\n【85】 Administration: Adult\n【86】 Medication Guide and/or Vaccine Information Statement (VIS)\n【87】 An FDA-approved patient medication guide, which is available with the product information and as follows, must be dispensed with this medication:\n【88】 Vivitrol: https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2021/021897s052lbl.pdf#page=33\n【89】 Use: Labeled Indications\n【90】 Use: Off-Label: Adult\n【91】 Medication Safety Issues\n【92】 Administration issues:\n【93】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【94】 None known.\n【95】 Drug Interactions\n【96】 (For additional information: Launch drug interactions program)\n【97】 Bremelanotide: May decrease the serum concentration of Naltrexone. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【98】 Lofexidine: May decrease the serum concentration of Naltrexone. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【99】 Methylnaltrexone: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Opioid Antagonists. Specifically, the risk for opioid withdrawal may be increased. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【100】 Naldemedine: Opioid Antagonists may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Naldemedine. Specifically, the risk for opioid withdrawal may be increased.  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【101】 Naloxegol: Opioid Antagonists may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Naloxegol. Specifically, the risk for opioid withdrawal may be increased.  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【102】 Opioid Agonists: Naltrexone may diminish the therapeutic effect of Opioid Agonists.  Management: Seek therapeutic alternatives to opioids.  See full drug interaction monograph for detailed recommendations. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【103】 Sibutramine: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Centrally Acting Weight Loss Agents. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【104】 Reproductive Considerations\n【105】 Naltrexone is not the preferred treatment for opioid use disorder during pregnancy; pregnancy testing is recommended prior to initiating naltrexone therapy (SAMHSA 2021).\n【106】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【107】 Naltrexone and the 6-beta-naltrexol metabolite cross the placenta (Towers 2020).\n【108】 Alcohol use and opioid use disorder are associated with adverse fetal and obstetrical outcomes. Information related to the use of naltrexone during pregnancy is limited (ACOG 711 2017; Farid 2008; Towers 2020; Tran 2017).\n【109】 Information related to the use of naltrexone for the treatment of opioid use disorder during pregnancy is limited. Consider transitioning to a preferred agent or discontinue treatment if the patient and health care provider agree the risk of relapse is low. If treatment with naltrexone continues, the risks and benefits should be discussed (ASAM 2020; SAMHSA 2021). Pregnant patients are not appropriate candidates for the ER injection (SAMHSA 2021).\n【110】 Pharmacological agents should not be used for the treatment of alcohol use disorder in pregnant patients unless needed for the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal or a coexisting disorder; agents other than naltrexone are recommended for acute alcohol withdrawal (APA [Reus 2018]).\n【111】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【112】 Naltrexone and the 6-beta-naltrexol metabolite are present in breast milk (Chan 2004).\n【113】 According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and the benefits of treatment to the mother. Pharmacological agents should not be used for the treatment of alcohol use disorder in breastfeeding patients unless needed for the treatment of acute alcohol withdrawal or a coexisting disorder; agents other than naltrexone are recommended for acute alcohol withdrawal (APA [Reus 2018]).\n【114】 Monitoring Parameters\n【115】 Liver function tests (baseline and periodic); signs or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, injection-site reactions with IM administration; pregnancy test (baseline); hepatitis and HIV testing, particularly for patients with opioid use disorder (prior to initiation) (SAMHSA 2021); and depression and/or suicidal thinking\n【116】 Mechanism of Action\n【117】 Naltrexone (a pure opioid antagonist) is a cyclopropyl derivative of oxymorphone similar in structure to naloxone and nalorphine (a morphine derivative); it acts as a competitive antagonist at opioid receptor sites, showing the highest affinity for mu receptors. Endogenous opioids are involved in modulating the expression of alcohol's reinforcing effects (Hemby 1997; Lee 2005). Naltrexone also modifies the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis to suppress alcohol consumption (Williams 2004).\n【118】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【119】 Duration: Oral: 50 mg: 24 hours; 100 mg: 48 hours; 150 mg: 72 hours; IM: 4 weeks\n【120】 Absorption: Oral: Almost complete\n【121】 Distribution: Vd: ~1350 L; widely throughout the body but considerable interindividual variation exists\n【122】 Metabolism: Extensively metabolized via noncytochrome-mediated dehydrogenase conversion to 6-beta-naltrexol (primary metabolite) and related minor metabolites; glucuronide conjugates are also formed from naltrexone and its metabolites\n【123】 Oral: Extensive first-pass effect\n【124】 Protein binding: 21%\n【125】 Bioavailability: Oral: Variable range (5% to 40%)\n【126】 Half-life elimination: Oral: 4 hours; 6-beta-naltrexol: 13 hours; IM: Naltrexone and 6-beta-naltrexol: 5 to 10 days (dependent upon erosion of polymer)\n【127】 Time to peak, serum: Oral: ~60 minutes; IM: Biphasic: ~2 hours (first peak), ~2 to 3 days (second peak)\n【128】 Excretion: Primarily urine (as metabolites and small amounts of unchanged drug)\n【129】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【130】 Hepatic function impairment: An increase in naltrexone AUC of approximately 5- and 10-fold in patients with compensated and decompensated liver cirrhosis, respectively, compared with subjects with healthy liver function has been reported.\n【131】 Brand Names: International\n【132】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Naltrexone  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/naltrexone-drug-information?search=%E4%B8%80%E5%BA%A6%E7%97%94&source=search_result&selectedTitle=93%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms, may coexist with, or occur as an influenza complication. Baloxavir marboxil has not been shown to prevent such complications. Monitor for potential secondary bacterial infections and manage appropriately.\n【38】 • Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, angioedema, urticaria, and erythema multiforme have been reported; evaluate and treat accordingly.\n【39】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【40】 Reduced susceptibility to influenza A strains may occur in younger patients who receive baloxavir due to gene mutations of the polymerase acidic (PA) protein; use has been associated with treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in the PA protein of the influenza RNA polymerase complex (PA/I38X), particularly in influenza A subtype H3N2 isolates, which result in reduced baloxavir susceptibility. The rate of PA substitutions has been reported to be 13.5% to 23.4% in children <12 years of age, occurring more frequently in children <5 years of age (43% of patients; 36/83) as compared to children 5 to <12 years of age (16% of patients; 19/117) (Baker 2020; Hirotsu 2020; manufacturer's labeling). In contrast, a study in adolescent patients (12 to 17 years of age) reported a substitution rate of 9.8% (Portsmouth 2020), and a study that included both adolescent and adult patients reported a substitution rate of 2.2% to 9.7% (Hayden 2018). Children infected with influenza viruses that developed PA substitutions after receipt of baloxavir had delayed symptom resolution (79.8 vs 42.8 hours) and a longer duration of viral shedding (180 vs 24 hours) compared to children with viruses that did not develop substitutions after baloxavir receipt (Hirotsu 2020). In a study of 374 patients who received baloxavir for influenza prophylaxis after a household contact became ill, 5 of 15 patients who developed PA substitutions were ≤10 years of age. While some have reported transmission of PA substitutions among household contacts, in this study PA substitutions were detected only in patients who received baloxavir (Ikematsu 2020).\n【41】 Product Availability\n【42】 Xofluza oral suspension: FDA approved November 2020; anticipated availability currently unknown.\n【43】 Dosage Forms: US\n【44】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Do not mix with soft food or liquids. Should be administered while patient is upright; should not be administered while the patient is lying down. Use an accurate measuring device (eg, oral syringe, measuring cup) for oral administration. For administration via a feeding tube, draw up suspension using a compatible enteral syringe; flush with 1 mL of water before and after administration.\n【57】 Use: Labeled Indications\n【58】 Limitations of use: Influenza viruses change over time, and factors such as the virus type or subtype, emergence of resistance, or changes in viral virulence may diminish the clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use baloxavir marboxil.\n【59】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【60】 Drug Interactions\n【61】 (For additional information: Launch drug interactions program)\n【62】 Influenza Virus Vaccine (Live/Attenuated): Antiviral Agents (Influenza A and B) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Influenza Virus Vaccine (Live/Attenuated).  Management: Avoid administration of live influenza virus vaccine (LAIV) within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after administration of antiviral agents. Consider avoiding LAIV if peramivir was given within the last 5 days or baloxavir was given within the last 17 days. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【63】 Polyvalent Cation Containing Products: May decrease the serum concentration of Baloxavir Marboxil. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【64】 Food Interactions\n【65】 Baloxavir may form a chelate with calcium products, decreasing baloxavir exposure. Management: Avoid coadministration with dairy products\n【66】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【67】 Adverse events were not observed in animal reproduction studies.\n【68】 Pregnant and postpartum patients (≤2 weeks after delivery) have a higher risk for complications from influenza, including preterm delivery, pneumonia, admission to a hospital or ICU, and maternal and fetal death. Underlying maternal medical conditions increase these risks (ACOG 2018; CDC 2020a).\n【69】 Due to lack of data, baloxavir marboxil is not recommended for use in pregnant patients (CDC 2020a; CDC 2020b).\n【70】 An algorithm is available for the treatment of pregnant patients with known or suspected influenza (ACOG 2018). Refer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations for treatment updates based on resistance patterns (ACOG 2018; CDC 2020a).\n【71】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【72】 It is not known if baloxavir marboxil is present in breast milk.\n【73】 According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother. Due to lack of data, baloxavir marboxil is not recommended for use in patients who are breastfeeding (CDC 2020a; CDC 2020b).\n【74】 Monitoring Parameters\n【75】 Monitor for hypersensitivity reactions; potential secondary bacterial infections.\n【76】 Mechanism of Action\n【77】 Baloxavir marboxil is an oral prodrug that is converted to baloxavir, an inhibitor of the endonuclease activity of a selective polymerase acidic (PA) protein, which is required for viral gene transcription, resulting in inhibition of influenza virus replication. Baloxavir has demonstrated antiviral activity against influenza A and B viruses, including strains resistant to standard current antiviral agents (Hayden 2018).\n【78】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【79】 Distribution: Vd: 1,180 L.\n【80】 Protein binding: ~93% to 94%.\n【81】 Metabolism: Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug; completely converted via UGT1A3 (major) and CYP3A4 (minor) to the active metabolite (baloxavir).\n【82】 Half-life elimination: 79.1 hour.\n【83】 Time to peak: 4 hours.\n【84】 Excretion: Feces (80.1%); Urine (14.7%; 3.3% as baloxavir).\n【85】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【86】 Body weight: As weight increases, exposure to baloxavir decreases.\n【87】 Brand Names: International\n【88】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Baloxavir  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/baloxavir-drug-information?search=%E4%B9%B3%E6%88%BF%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%AD%A6%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%BA%E6%9C%AA%E7%9F%A5%E7%9A%84%E8%82%BF%E7%98%A4&source=search_result&selectedTitle=143%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

Variation in how patients respond to medical illnesses and hospitalization appears to be due at least in part to psychological factors [2]. Hippocrates wrote that “It is more important to know what sort of person has a disease than what sort of disease a person has” [3].\n【2】 PFAOMC emphasizes one causal direction in the interactions between mind and body, that is, the effects of psychological factors on general medical conditions. In most patients with medical conditions, there are also effects in the other direction (ie, medical illnesses affect psychological function).\n【3】 This topic reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of PFAOMC. Management of PFAOMC is discussed separately. (See  \"Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions: Management\".)\n【4】 ●Nonadherence to treatment is one feature of PFAOMC and several studies have found large nonadherence rates [4], even for cardiovascular disease and posttransplant immune suppression [5]. As an example:\n【5】 ●A study of general medical patients (n >1500) found that irritability in the absence of any mental disorder was present in 27 percent [8]. A comparable study (n >800 general medical patients) found that demoralization in the absence of major depression was present in 21 percent [9].\n【6】 ●In United States private insurance billing data, PFAOMC is a more common diagnosis than conversion disorder and other somatic symptom disorders [10].\n【7】 Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions can occur at any point in the lifespan [1].\n【8】 ●Promoting known risks for medical illness, including smoking, substance abuse, overuse of analgesics, sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, obesity, poor sleep hygiene, and unsafe sex\n【9】 ●Influencing how patients respond to their symptoms, including whether and how they seek care\n【10】 ●Effects upon the physician-patient relationship and the physician’s diagnostic and treatment decisions\n【11】 ●Reducing compliance with diagnostic recommendations, treatment, and lifestyle change\n【12】 ●Interfering with rehabilitation through lack of motivation and poor tolerance of pain and frustration\n【13】 Many of the adverse effects of psychological factors upon medical illness may be amplified by social factors, including marital stress, poor social support, job strain, and disadvantaged socioeconomic status.\n【14】 In addition, psychological factors can directly affect pathophysiology. As an example, stress has been experimentally shown to cause myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary heart disease [11]. In addition, stress and depression are associated with several adverse effects upon the immune system, including poorer antibody response to vaccines, decreased control of latent viruses, and worse wound healing [12,13]. Psychopathology is also associated with disruptions in homeostasis, including sleep architecture, other circadian rhythms, and endocrine function [14].\n【15】 ●Constitute a risk factor for the medical disorder (eg, smoking among patients with coronary heart disease or overeating in diabetes)\n【16】 ●Influence the underlying pathophysiology of the medical illness (eg, marital conflict leads to angina in patients with coronary heart disease or to bronchospasm in asthma)\n【17】 ●Adversely affect either the course of illness or treatment (eg, anxiety that exacerbates asthma, or neglecting doses of insulin to lose weight)\n【18】 The adverse effects of PFAOMC include increased risk for suffering, disability, or death [1]. These effects can develop acutely (eg, stress-induced cardiomyopathy) (see  \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of stress (takotsubo) cardiomyopathy\") or chronically (eg, time urgency, impatience, or hostility leading to hypertension).\n【19】 Psychological and behavioral factors can potentially affect virtually all general medical conditions, including illnesses with well-established pathophysiology (eg, coronary heart disease, cancer, or diabetes), functional syndromes (eg, migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, or fibromyalgia), or symptoms (eg, pain, fatigue, or dizziness) [1].\n【20】 ●Regression\n【21】 ●Anxiety\n【22】 ●Depression\n【23】 ●Denial\n【24】 ●Anger\n【25】 ●Other\n【26】 Regression varies across a spectrum and in moderation is adaptive, because sick patients must give up some control and accept dependency upon others. This level of regression may evoke positive emotions in clinicians, such as feeling capable and needed [2]. However, more pronounced regression is problematic; it is difficult to care for patients who have minimal tolerance for frustration, pain, or being alone; or are infantile, needy, continuously whining, and easily upset. Like young infants, some regressed patients are constantly making requests of clinicians and other caregivers. These patients avoid responsibility for their care and complain about its inadequacy. Other regressed patients excessively need to control their medical care; they may insist that care is provided in a specific manner, and they tend to be perfectionistic and intolerant of any (perceived or real) errors or delays in care. Regression can also take the form of entitlement, in which patients demand attention and are oblivious to the needs of other patients.\n【27】 Patients who seem too comfortable in a regressed state have often received significant secondary gain during previous illnesses. Secondary gain is an external motivation for behavior. As an example, during a traumatic childhood with emotionally or physically absent or abusive parents, the care of clinicians may have been among the only experiences of nurturance and kindness received by a child. Now as an adult patient, the individual may unconsciously yearn to re-create this experience and thus regress.\n【28】 Fear of death is frequent in the medically ill, but not necessarily in proportion to the severity of disease. Many other factors may magnify or diminish this fear (eg, previous losses, religious beliefs, personality, intractable pain, and previous treatment experiences, including witnessing other patients’ deaths). For some patients with minor illness, the fear of death can be troubling; for other patients, with severe or even terminal illness, the fear of death may be less important than other fears.\n【29】 Other common forms of anxiety experienced by medically ill patients include separation anxiety (eg, fear of being alone in the hospital), fear of strangers (eg, difficulty trusting new clinicians), fear of injury to or losing control of bodily functions (eg, blindness, incontinence, or paralysis), fear of losing body parts (amputation), fear of pain, fear of losing one’s social role and function (eg, career or family), fear of dependency upon others, and fear of closeness (eg, in paranoid patients). Patients may be aware of some fears but unaware of others.\n【30】 In most diseases, some degree of anxiety is expected and adaptive because it puts the patient on alert. However, even normal anxiety may occasionally have adverse effects. As an example, immediately after an acute myocardial infarction, anxiety-associated increases in heart rate and blood pressure may be dangerous and require treatment [15]. Anxiety symptoms may also aggravate asthma [16] and are associated with poorer behavioral management of diabetes and poorer glycemic control [17].\n【31】 Too little anxiety makes one vulnerable to minimizing the risks of disease and need for treatment. However, in some cases the apparent absence of anxiety is misleading, because the patient may be extremely anxious without conscious awareness of it, using defenses like denial (see 'Denial' below) to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n【32】 Anxiety symptoms and disorders may adversely affect the course of illness in general medical disorders. A meta-analysis of seven prospective observational studies (n >6700 patients with coronary artery disease), which adjusted for potential confounding factors (eg, age or history of smoking or diabetes), found that a one standard deviation increase in anxiety rating scale scores was associated with a 21 percent increase in poor outcomes (eg, mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke) [18]. In addition, a prospective study followed patients with myocardial infarction (n >1900) for up to three years found; after adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, age, body mass index, and prior general medical history), the analyses found that among patients with the highest level of anxiety, all-cause mortality was 78 percent higher [19].\n【33】 Too much anxiety can also lead to functional impairment and poor adherence to diagnostic tests or treatment (eg, “I can’t bear to get a mammogram because I’m afraid it might find something”). Medical care is often disrupted by common health-related phobias, including fear of:\n【34】 ●Needles\n【35】 ●Blood\n【36】 ●Dentists\n【37】 ●Being put to sleep\n【38】 Anxiety can also amplify perception of pain and other aversive sensations.\n【39】 Depressive symptoms are associated with onset of general medical conditions and poor outcomes in these conditions:\n【40】 ●Coronary heart disease – Many studies have demonstrated that depression is an independent risk factor for incident coronary heart disease [20], as well as poor outcomes in coronary heart disease, including recurrent coronary events, impaired functioning, poorer quality of life, and mortality [21,22]. Information about depression following myocardial infarction is discussed separately. (See  \"Psychosocial factors in acute coronary syndrome\", section on 'Depression after acute coronary syndrome'.)\n【41】 ●Stroke – A prospective community study (n >6000 individuals followed for up to 22 years) found that after adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, age, blood pressure, body mass index, and smoking status), increasing levels of depression at baseline were associated with an increased risk of subsequent stroke [23]. In addition, a national registry study of patients with stroke (n >150,000) found that during two years post-stroke, depression occurred in 25 percent; after controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, age, sex, and general medical comorbidities), the analyses found that all-cause mortality was 89 percent greater in patients with post-stroke depression than nondepressed stroke patients [24]. Additional information about depression in stroke patients is discussed separately. (See  \"Complications of stroke: An overview\", section on 'Depression'.)\n【42】 ●Diabetes – The number of depressive symptoms is related to the number of diabetic symptoms (eg, coldness, numbness or pain in the hands and feet; polyuria; and abnormal thirst) [25], and depressive syndromes are associated with increased rates of hyperglycemia, diabetic complications, and mortality [26,27]. As an example, a prospective observational study followed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus for up to three years, and found that after adjusting for potential confounding factors (eg, age, sex, obesity, smoking, and hemoglobin A1C), death was more likely to occur in patients with minor depression (n >300) than nondepressed patients (n >3300) (14 versus 8 percent) [28]. In a cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 diabetes (n >700), those who were depressed were more likely to smoke, be overweight/obese, and/or have worse glycemic control than patients who were not depressed [29].\n【43】 ●End stage renal disease – Hospitalization and mortality are greater in patients with end stage renal disease who are depressed, compared with patients who are not depressed [30-32]. As an example, a prospective observational study of a nationally representative sample of hemodialysis patients (n >5000) found that the risk of death was 40 percent greater in depressed patients than nondepressed patients (relative risk 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.6) [33]. Additional information about depression in end stage renal disease is discussed separately. (See  \"Psychiatric illness in adults receiving maintenance dialysis\", section on 'Major depression'.)\n【44】 ●Rheumatoid arthritis – Among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, depressive symptoms are associated with increased pain, fatigue, and disability [34]. In addition, depression is an independent risk factor for mortality [35]. Additional information about depression in rheumatoid arthritis is discussed separately. (See  \"Overview of the systemic and nonarticular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis\", section on 'Constitutional/systemic symptoms'.)\n【45】 In the face of disease and disability, patients frequently feel dejected, discouraged, and helpless. When sadness becomes too great and demoralization occurs, maladaptive behaviors may ensue; depressed patients are at increased risk for nonadherence with medical treatment, smoking, substance abuse, a sedentary lifestyle, unsafe sex, and poor nutrition. Nonadherent depressed patients may appear to be passively suicidal (eg, transplant patients who deliberately miss doses of maintenance immunosuppressive drugs). Depression can amplify perception of pain and other aversive sensations.\n【46】 Denial occurs often in major medical illnesses, particularly among individuals who deny other life stressors, such as marital problems. In addition, denial is frequent in patients who poorly tolerate dependency associated with medical illness, and for whom the sick role is inconsistent with how they think of themselves.\n【47】 The extent of denial in patients with general medical conditions varies. Patients may deny any illness at all, or acknowledge the symptoms but deny the particular diagnosis (usually displacing it to a more benign organ system, such as interpreting angina as indigestion), or accept the diagnosis but deny the need for treatment and lifestyle change.\n【48】 Severe denial, in which patients refuse to accept obvious symptoms and signs of a disease, is a defense against overwhelming fear, if no other evidence of major psychopathology (eg, paranoid delusions) is present. Extreme denial of a general medical illness may distort the perception of reality, reach psychotic proportions, and appear comparable to the gross impairment in reality testing that occurs in psychotic disorders (eg, schizophrenia or delusional disorder) [2]. However, extreme denial in psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is not regarded as a psychotic phenomenon.\n【49】 Denial of a medical illness is not always pathologic [36,37]; the adaptive value varies, depending upon the nature or stage of the illness. Excessive denial may delay diagnosis, result in nonadherence with medications and rehabilitation plans, and lead patients to ignore modifiable risk factors. However, maintaining some degree of denial in the initial response to a grave diagnosis or complication helps patients to adjust to the bad news and continue functioning without feeling overwhelmed by the full awareness of the implications of their disease. Although denial of early cancer can be maladaptive if patients delay seeking necessary treatment, denial of untreatable metastatic cancer may enhance quality of life before death [2].\n【50】 In addition, moderate denial during treatment for acute coronary syndromes may be adaptive by reducing anxiety without preventing the patient from cooperating with clinical care. A prospective observational study of patients hospitalized for unstable angina (n = 48) found that episodes of angina occurred less often in patients with higher levels of denial compared to patients with lower levels (1 versus 3 episodes per day), and that medical stabilization occurred in more patients with higher levels of denial than lower levels (92 versus 65 percent) [38].\n【51】 Insufficient denial may also be harmful. Too little denial may leave the patient so afraid of disability and death that invalidism develops.\n【52】 ●Early age at onset of smoking, as well as smoking daily, heavy smoking, and nicotine dependence [39,40]\n【53】 ●Increased heart rate and cortisol stress responses [41], and sleep disturbances [42]\n【54】 ●Deterioration of the doctor-patient relationship [43]\n【55】 ●Poorer adherence to treatment [44]\n【56】 ●Increased risk of hypertension [45], peptic ulcer [46], and acute and chronic pain that is more intense and disabling [47,48]\n【57】 ●Increased cardiac events (eg, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, or coronary heart disease mortality) among initially healthy populations and in patients with existing coronary heart disease [49-52]\n【58】 ●Posttraumatic stress disorder – Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can lead to medication nonadherence in patients with chronic medical conditions. A meta-analysis of 16 studies (n >4000 patients) found that among patients with conditions such as the human immunodeficiency virus, cardiovascular disease, or stroke, medication nonadherence was greater in patients with PTSD than those without PTSD (odds ratio 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4) [53]. In addition, nonadherence was twice as likely in the subgroup with PTSD induced by a medical event, compared to patients without PTSD (2.08, 95% CI 1.03-4.18).\n【59】 ●Personality traits – Personality traits exist on a continuum with personality disorders, and patients typically display multiple traits. The stress of general medical conditions and hospitalization can exacerbate traits to the point that they are problematic. Examples of traits include [1,2,54]:\n【60】 Additional information about personality traits is discussed separately. (See  \"Overview of personality disorders\", section on 'Clinical manifestations' and  \"Approaches to the therapeutic relationship in patients with personality disorders\".)\n【61】 ●Attachment (relationship) style – Attachment (relationship) styles can be categorized based upon whether one has a positive or negative view of oneself, as well as positive or negative expectations of others [2]. In addition, the manner in which patients with general medical disorders relate to others may affect course of illness. As an example, a prospective observational study followed nondepressed patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus (n >3500) for up to five years; patients were classified as independent if they were less inclined to seek social support, and as interactive if they were more inclined to seek support [55]. After adjusting for potential confounding sociodemographic and clinical factors, the risk of death was greater in patients with an independent attachment style than interactive style (hazard ratio 1.20, 95% CI 1.01-1.43).\n【62】 ●Coping style – Coping styles (behaviors) for managing the stress of medical illnesses include [2,54]:\n【63】 Most patients use multiple strategies to cope with complex stressful situations.\n【64】 Patients with medical illnesses who make greater use of problem solving (task-oriented coping) may have better outcomes. A prospective study followed patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome for an average of five years and found that the risk of subsequent major cardiac events (eg, myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death) was lower in patients who reported higher task-oriented coping (hazard ratio 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7) [56]. Problem-focused coping may promote better medication adherence, increased physical activity, healthier diets, and improved management of stressors.\n【65】 ●Defense mechanisms – Defense mechanisms (table 2) are conceptualized as intrapsychic unconscious processes that patients use to defend themselves and confront anxiety and conflict, preserve self-esteem, and maintain a sense of control. Defense mechanisms are discussed separately. (See 'Regression' above and 'Denial' above and  \"Unipolar depression in adults: Psychodynamic psychotherapy\", section on 'Defense mechanisms'.)\n【66】 Outcomes of general medical conditions are typically poorer for patients who are psychologically distressed, compared with patients with the same medical disorders without psychological distress [1]. Several studies have documented that psychiatric problems in medical patients are associated with increases in medical symptoms and length of hospital stay [57].\n【67】 Identifying psychological factors begins with screening questions. For patients who screen positive, clinicians should obtain additional history. An empathic approach is essential. Examples of screening questions are as follows:\n【68】 ●Regression and dependency – Regressed patients are typically not aware that they are unusually needy; thus, we suggest clinicians ask themselves whether the patient needs excessive reassurance, excessively depends upon others (eg, nurses), or poorly tolerates frustration or pain. Although clinicians can ask patients, “Do you need more reassurance than other people?” many regressed patients will answer no.\n【69】 ●Anxiety – “Are you often bothered by feeling nervous or worrying too much?” “Do you usually have trouble relaxing?”\n【70】 ●Depression – “Are you often been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?” “Do you often have little interest or pleasure in doing things?”\n【71】 ●Denial – “How much do you worry about your illness?” Responses such as “Not at all” suggest denial; by contrast, a response such as “All the time” suggests anxiety.\n【72】 ●Anger – “Does your temper often get the best of you?” “Do you often find yourself tense, annoyed, or frustrated with other people?”\n【73】 It is also helpful to ask patients how they have coped with previous stressful situations, because they are likely to use the same strategies in the present [2].\n【74】 ●A general medical symptom or disorder is present.\n【75】 ●Psychological or behavioral factors negatively affect the medical condition in one or more of the following ways:\n【76】 ●Other mental disorders (eg, major depression or panic disorder) do not better explain the psychological or behavioral factors. As an example, patients with agoraphobia who do not leave the house to seek medical care are not given a second diagnosis of PFAOMC.\n【77】 The close temporal relationship between abnormal psychological or behavioral factors with a general medical illness is not sufficient to diagnose PFAOMC; there must also be at least some evidence that the factors exert a clinically significant adverse effect upon the illness [1].\n【78】 DSM-5 specifies the severity of PFAOMC as follows [1]:\n【79】 ●Mild – Increases medical risk (eg, intermittent nonadherence with hypertension medications)\n【80】 ●Moderate – Exacerbates general medical condition (eg, anxiety worsens asthma)\n【81】 ●Severe – Causes emergency department visit or hospitalization\n【82】 ●Extreme – Is life threatening (eg, ignoring myocardial infarction symptoms)\n【83】 The diagnosis of PFAOMC is recorded together with the diagnosis for the relevant general medical condition.\n【84】 The World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases-11th Revision (ICD-11) includes the diagnosis “psychological and behavioral factors affecting disorders or diseases classified elsewhere” [58], which is comparable to the DSM-5 diagnosis of PFAOMC. Psychological and behavioral factors affecting disorders or diseases classified elsewhere (in ICD-11) applies to patients with psychological or behavioral factors that adversely affect the manifestation, treatment, or course of a general medical disorder (eg, asthma, gastric ulcer, or ulcerative colitis). There are six specific subtypes of psychological and behavioral factors: mental disorder, psychological symptom, personality trait or coping style, maladaptive health behavior, or a stress-related physiological response that adversely affects the general medical condition. The diagnosis of psychological and behavioral factors affecting disorders or diseases classified elsewhere is made only when the psychological factors increase the risk of suffering, disability, or death and are a focus of clinical attention. In addition, the diagnosis is recorded together with the diagnosis for the relevant medical condition.\n【85】 Both directions of influence are operative in many patients, that is, the patient’s emotional state aggravates and is aggravated by the medical disorder. In these cases, PFAOMC and adjustment disorder are both diagnosed.\n【86】 Additional information about diagnosing conversion disorder is discussed separately. (See  \"Functional neurological symptom disorder (conversion disorder) in adults: Terminology, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis\".)\n【87】 Additional information about diagnosing illness anxiety disorder is discussed separately. (See  \"Illness anxiety disorder: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, assessment, and diagnosis\", section on 'Diagnosis'.)\n【88】 The distinction between the two disorders is often not clear cut; rather the difference is one of emphasis. Somatic symptom disorder emphasizes the disproportionate and persistently abnormal thoughts, feelings, and/or behaviors centered upon the physical symptoms (eg, patients with angina worry continuously that they will have a heart attack, measure their blood pressure multiple times each day, and unnecessarily limit their activity). By contrast, PFAOMC emphasizes that psychological factors adversely affect the course and outcome of the medical condition (eg, angina is precipitated by anxiety).\n【89】 Additional information about diagnosing somatic symptom disorder is discussed separately. (See  \"Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis\", section on 'Diagnosis'.)\n【90】 ●The prevalence of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions (PFAOMC) is not clear, but may be large. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)\n【91】 ●Psychological and behavioral factors can affect general medical illnesses in many ways, such as promoting known risks for medical illness, influencing how patients respond to their symptoms, effects upon the physician-patient relationship, reducing adherence, as well as effects upon pathophysiology. (See 'Pathogenesis' above.)\n【92】 ●The essential feature of PFAOMC is the presence of a general medical symptom or disorder that is adversely affected by psychological factors, including regression, anxiety, depression, denial, and anger. Other factors include personality traits, attachment (relationship) style, coping style, and defense mechanisms (table 2). (See 'Clinical features' above.)\n【93】 ●Physicians should consider whether psychological factors may be responsible when general medical illnesses do not respond as expected to standard treatments. However, premature attribution to psychological factors may lead clinicians to overlook a medical explanation for “treatment-resistant disease” and unfairly blame the patient. Identifying psychological factors begins with screening questions.

Based on the mechanism of action, adverse effects on fetal development may occur following in utero exposure to tagraxofusp.\n【136】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【137】 It is not known if tagraxofusp is present in breast milk.\n【138】 Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer during treatment or for 1 week after the last tagraxofusp dose.\n【139】 Monitoring Parameters\n【140】 Monitor serum albumin, transaminases, and creatinine prior to each dose and as clinically indicated thereafter. Evaluate pregnancy status within 7 days prior to initiating tagraxofusp therapy (in patients who could become pregnant). Monitor vital signs (eg, heart rate, BP, weight) prior to each dose; monitor for signs/symptoms of capillary leak syndrome (eg, weight gain, new onset or worsening edema, pulmonary edema, hypotension, hemodynamic instability), hepatotoxicity, and hypersensitivity reactions.\n【141】 The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion (ASCO [Hwang 2020]) recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.\n【142】 Mechanism of Action\n【143】 Tagraxofusp is a CD123-directed fusion protein which is composed of human interleukin-3 (IL-3) and truncated diphtheria toxin (DT). After binding to CD123, tagraxofusp is internalized, leading to inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death (Sun 2018).\n【144】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【145】 Distribution: 5.1 L; 21.2 L in patients with preexisting anti-drug antibodies\n【146】 Half-life elimination: 0.7 hours\n【147】 Excretion: Clearance: 7.1 L/hour; 13.9 L/hour in patients with preexisting anti-drug antibodies\n【148】 Brand Names: International\n【149】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Tagraxofusp  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/tagraxofusp-drug-information?search=%E7%B4%AF%E5%8F%8A%E6%B3%8C%E5%B0%BF%E5%99%A8%E5%AE%98%E4%BA%A4%E6%90%AD%E8%B7%A8%E8%B6%8A%E9%83%A8%E4%BD%8D%E7%9A%84%E8%85%BA%E7%99%8C&source=search_result&selectedTitle=56%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

The clinical manifestations and evaluation of patients with respiratory muscle weakness are discussed separately. (See  \"Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation\".)\n【2】 The approach outlined in this topic is in keeping for the most-part with guidelines [1].\n【3】 The response of respiratory muscle weakness to specific treatments may vary depending on the specific disease entity. For example, respiratory failure due to conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenia gravis, polymyositis, and multiple sclerosis may be responsive to disease-specific therapy such that respiratory failure resolves as the underlying disease improves in response to therapy; in such cases ventilatory assistance may only be temporary. In contrast, other neuromuscular disorders are not reversible or may progress despite therapy (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [ALS], Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DMD]), thereby necessitating full-time ventilatory support and adjunctive aids. (See 'Chronic ventilatory support' below.)\n【4】 Specific treatments are found in individual topics:\n【5】 ●ALS (see  \"Disease-modifying treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\" and  \"Symptom-based management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\")\n【6】 ●Myasthenia gravis (see  \"Overview of the treatment of myasthenia gravis\" and  \"Myasthenic crisis\")\n【7】 ●Guillain-Barré syndrome (see  \"Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis\")\n【8】 ●Multiple sclerosis (see  \"Initial disease-modifying therapy for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in adults\" and  \"Treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis in adults\" and  \"Symptom management of multiple sclerosis in adults\")\n【9】 ●DMD (see  \"Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: Management and prognosis\")\n【10】 ●Polymyositis (see  \"Initial treatment of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults\")\n【11】 ●Diaphragmatic or phrenic nerve injury (see  \"Surgical treatment of phrenic nerve injury\" and  \"Recognition and management of diaphragmatic injury in adults\")\n【12】 ●Myotonic dystrophy (see  \"Myotonic dystrophy: Treatment and prognosis\")\n【13】 ●Mitochondrial myopathy (see  \"Mitochondrial disorders: Treatment\")\n【14】 Patients typically present with dyspnea and cough. Patients may also complain of a sense of \"suffocation.\" Respiratory distress may not be as apparent as in patients who do not have respiratory muscle weakness. This is because many patients cannot increase their respiratory rate or tidal volume to meet ventilatory demand and additionally may not be able to expectorate large volumes of sputum, particularly if they are dehydrated. These features may mislead the clinician into believing that the patient is comfortable and does not need intubation. Thus, clinicians should look for subtle signs, such as thoracoabdominal paradox, and have a low threshold to perform arterial blood gas analysis for the early detection of acute hypercapnia.\n【15】 The need for noninvasive versus invasive ventilation should be evaluated. Indications for either form of ventilation in the acute setting are similar to those in the general population and are discussed separately. Aspects that are particular to patients with respiratory muscle weakness are discussed in this section. (See  \"Approach to the adult with dyspnea in the emergency department\" and  \"The evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the adult patient with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure\" and  \"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications\" and  \"The decision to intubate\".)\n【16】 A surrogate marker of lung function has been studied as a tool to help clinicians decide who to intubate. As an example, a single breath count test (SBC) is performed by the patient taking full inhalation and then counting, for as long as possible, at a rate of two counts per second. Studies have shown a correlation between SBC testing and vital capacity with lower counts indicating more severe respiratory dysfunction. In a study of 68 Guillain-Barré patients admitted to neurocritical care unit, 75 percent with SBC <19 required mechanical ventilation. A strong correlation between SBC and vital capacity was found [4]. In a study of 94 patients with Guillain-Barré Syndrome, 32 of 44 patients with a single breath count <7 required intubation compared to 0 of 50 patients with counts >7 [5]. Studies in patients with myasthenia gravis suggest that counts below 20 to 25 indicate abnormal respiratory function [6]. Studies specifically examining the role of SBC in predicting the need for noninvasive ventilation (NIV) are not yet available. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to consider NIV in acute settings when the SBC is <20. There are insufficient data to make a recommendation in patients with stable chronic disease.\n【17】 In brief, we suggest the following as a guide:\n【18】 ●We consider most patients with neuromuscular weakness and acute respiratory failure as candidates for NIV unless contraindications such as the need for immediate intubation or severe bulbar dysfunction are present (table 2). Patients with significant bulbar dysfunction are poor candidates for NIV since they are unable to protect their lower airway and are at high risk of aspiration with NIV.\n【19】 ●In general, we initiate NIV using an oronasal mask to minimize leaks and ensure adequate ventilation. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BPAP) is the most common mode used. BPAP requires inspiratory and expiratory PAP (IPAP, EPAP) to be set with the difference between the two representing the degree of pressure support. The bigger the difference the greater the tidal volume that is delivered. We make sure that patients are not overventilated relative to their baseline gas exchange parameters and target baseline values for arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide parameters.\n【20】 ●Patients with respiratory muscle weakness (regardless of whether bulbar dysfunction is present) may experience upper airway obstruction with NIV. IPAP delivered via an oronasal mask may cause intermittent posterior displacement of the tongue resulting in inspiratory narrowing of the upper airway. An adequate EPAP level can help prevent this, especially if pharyngeal collapse caused by the abrupt reduction from inspiratory to expiratory pressure contributes to upper airway obstruction. Alternatively, the patient can be switched to a nasal mask with a chin strap (to prevent air leak from the mouth) [7].\n【21】 ●For patients already on chronic NIV due to chronic respiratory failure from respiratory muscle weakness, settings and duration of use may need to be increased to accommodate increased ventilatory needs. For example, the IPAP may need to be increased to increase the tidal volume delivered and the support may need to be extended from nocturnal support only to 24 hour support.\n【22】 ●For patients with upper extremity weakness, there is a relative contraindication to NIV since they cannot grasp the mask to remove it if needed (eg, in the event of unexpected vomiting).\n【23】 In patients with acute respiratory failure from respiratory muscle weakness, small observational studies suggest that NIV may decrease the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, shorten intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, and improve mortality [8-10]:\n【24】 ●In a prospective cohort study of 17 patients with neuromuscular disease who received NIV for acute respiratory failure (24 episodes), 79 percent did not progress to invasive mechanical ventilation [9]. A smaller retrospective study demonstrated similar findings [10].\n【25】 ●An observational study compared 14 patients with neuromuscular disease who received NIV for acute respiratory failure to 14 historical controls who received invasive mechanical ventilation [8]. The NIV group had lower mortality, a shorter length of ICU stay, and lower need for invasive mechanical ventilation. However, half of those on NIV also received a percutaneously placed small-bore tube providing tracheal access for secretion removal (ie, \"mini-tracheostomy\").\n【26】 Select features in patients with acute respiratory failure from respiratory muscle weakness may predict the need for NIV. In a study of 32 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who had acute respiratory infection, predictors of the need for NIV included a forced vital capacity (FVC) <55 percent predicted and a reduced peak cough flow <2.9 L/sec [11]. (See  \"Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation\", section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'.)\n【27】 Intubation with select induction agents should be considered. Agents including ketamine, etomidate, combined ketamine with propofol, or reduced dose propofol may be preferred since they may decrease the risk of prolonged hypotension that frequently follows intubation in patients with neuromuscular weakness who are hypovolemic and debilitated. Patients with dysautonomia (especially with Guillain-Barré syndrome) may also experience profound hypotension if the patient is positioned head up or have a pronounced vagal response to intubation, especially if the dose of induction agent is inadequate. Succinylcholine should be avoided since it can trigger malignant hyperthermia in patients with some conditions that cause muscle weakness (table 4), life threatening hyperkalemia in patients with denervating conditions, anesthesia-induced rhabdomyolysis (eg, in patients with Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy), and result in an unpredictable response in patients with select muscle disorders (eg, patients with myasthenia are typically resistant to succinylcholine). Similarly, the response to nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs; eg, rocuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium) is unpredictable in patients with some muscle diseases (eg, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) while patients with myasthenia gravis are exquisitely sensitive to nondepolarizing NMBAs. (See  \"Rapid sequence intubation in adults for emergency medicine and critical care\".)\n【28】 ●Ventilator care (see  \"Overview of initiating invasive mechanical ventilation in adults in the intensive care unit\")\n【29】 ●Sedation and analgesia (see  \"Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Selection, initiation, maintenance, and withdrawal\")\n【30】 ●Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (see  \"Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in adult nonorthopedic surgical patients\")\n【31】 ●Stress ulcer prophylaxis (see  \"Stress ulcers in the intensive care unit: Diagnosis, management, and prevention\")\n【32】 ●Prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia (see  \"Risk factors and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults\")\n【33】 Specific issues in managing ventilated patients with neuromuscular disorders include the following:\n【34】 ●Avoidance of overventilation – We make sure that patients are not overventilated relative to their baseline gas exchange parameters and target baseline values for arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide parameters.\n【35】 ●Physical therapy – Critically ill patients with neuromuscular disease are particularly at increased risk for developing superimposed critical illness myopathy or polyneuropathy. Measures to reduce this risk and prevent post intensive care unit syndrome should be undertaken. (See  \"Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness\" and  \"Post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) in adults: Clinical features and diagnostic evaluation\".)\n【36】 ●Fluid and electrolytes – Particular care should be taken to correct electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia) and avoid factors that may further compromise respiratory muscle function, including neuromuscular blocking agents, aminoglycosides, and glucocorticoids.\n【37】 ●Nutrition – Overfeeding must be avoided as the associated increase in carbon dioxide production can worsen hypercapnia [13]. Nutrition in patients requiring continuous chronic ventilatory support is discussed separately. (See  \"Malnutrition in advanced lung disease\" and  \"Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview\" and  \"Noninvasive ventilatory support and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction\", section on 'Nutrition'.)\n【38】 Our rationale for this approach is that patients referred to chronic weaning units are a group of patients who classically have diaphragmatic weakness and in whom half fail weaning trials of a duration longer than two hours; we make the assumption that this likely applies to patients with neuromuscular disease.\n【39】 Although not routine, we also have a low threshold to extubate to NIV. In a case control study, 10 patients with neuromuscular disease who were extubated directly to NIV and received assisted coughing aids after extubation, were less likely to require reintubation and tracheostomy compared with 10 historic controls [14]. (See  \"Weaning from mechanical ventilation: Readiness testing\" and  \"Initial weaning strategy in mechanically ventilated adults\" and  \"Management of the difficult-to-wean adult patient in the intensive care unit\" and  \"Management and prognosis of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation\", section on 'Weaning'.)\n【40】 Rates of weaning failure are high, ranging from 27 to 48 percent, and are largely supported by several small observational studies [15-18]. As examples:\n【41】 ●In a retrospective study of 44 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, 24 were extubated and 20 underwent tracheostomy without attempted extubation [15]; 42 percent of the extubations failed. This rate is significantly higher than the average rate of extubation failure in the ICU, which is approximately 10 to 15 percent.\n【42】 ●In a similar study of patients with myasthenic crisis, 27 percent of extubations failed [16]. Advanced age and pulmonary complications (pneumonia, atelectasis) were associated with extubation failure.\n【43】 Aggressive secretion clearance may decrease the duration of mechanical ventilation. In a retrospective cohort study of 18 patients with 24 episodes of acute respiratory failure due to myasthenia gravis, an aggressive approach to airway care (combining intermittent positive pressure breathing, bronchodilators, suctioning, sighs and chest physiotherapy) was associated with less atelectasis, less pneumonia, and a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation than seen in historical controls [19].\n【44】 Predictors of successful extubation include a MIP more negative than -50 cm H2O (eg, -60 cm H2O) and improvement of the VC by 4 mL/kg or more from pre-intubation to pre-extubation [15].\n【45】 Predictors of failure may include age >50 years, VC of less than 25 mL/kg during days one to six of intubation, evidence of chronic hypercapnia, dysautonomia, and poor baseline lung function [15,20,21]. Failure rates are higher if more than one predictor is present. For example, in one case-control study of 53 patients admitted for 73 episodes of myasthenic crisis, the likelihood of requiring intubation beyond two weeks was 88 percent if three risk factors were present [20].\n【46】 In another study of 37 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a pulmonary function score (PFS) was calculated immediately prior to intubation and on the twelfth day of mechanical ventilation [21]:\n【47】 The PFS ratio between the two values of <1 was associated with the need for more than three weeks of mechanical ventilation with a sensitivity and specificity of 100 and 70 percent, respectively. Validation of this index has not been undertaken. (See  \"Tracheostomy: Rationale, indications, and contraindications\", section on 'Optimal timing in mechanically ventilated patients'.)\n【48】 For patients who fail weaning or fail extubation with no identifiable reversible cause, tracheostomy is commonly considered beginning at 7 to 10 days, provided this is consistent with the patient’s wishes [22]. However, some patients with chronic neuromuscular disease may be successfully extubated to NIV without an intervening need for tracheostomy (eg, those who have been NIV-dependent prior to the acute event and in whom the reason for ventilation was fully reversible). (See  \"Noninvasive ventilatory support and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction\", section on 'Extubation to CNVS and MIE' and 'Tracheostomy' below and 'Patient values and preferences' below.)\n【49】 Following extubation, most patients should have a formal swallowing evaluation since swallowing dysfunction is typically more common in this population than in patients without respiratory muscle weakness. (See  \"Extubation management in the adult intensive care unit\", section on 'Refeeding'.)\n【50】 In patients with symptomatic chronic respiratory failure from respiratory muscle weakness who have evidence of nocturnal and/or daytime hypoventilation, we suggest evaluation for chronic ventilatory assistance with NIV.\n【51】 Evaluation for NIV is also appropriate inpatients with progressive neuromuscular disorders who have early physiologic evidence of respiratory muscle weakness, even in the absence of symptoms or frank hypoventilation and in those who have symptoms suggestive of sleep disordered breathing in association with their underlying NMD.\n【52】 Mask NIV administered at night with supplementary use of mouthpiece ventilation is typically employed as an initial strategy. Practical applications of NIV are discussed separately.  (See  \"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Patient selection and alternative modes of ventilatory support\".)\n【53】 NIV is typically indicated when any one or more of the following is present [30-35]:\n【54】 ●FVC <50 percent predicted\n【55】 ●VC <15 to 20 mL/kg, <60 percent of predicted, or <1 liter\n【56】 ●MIP <-60 cm H2O (eg, -50 cm H2O; indicates a high risk for hypercapnia)\n【57】 ●MEP <40 cm H2O (indicates inadequate cough strength and risk for secretion retention)\n【58】 ●SNIP <40 cm H2O\n【59】 These thresholds may vary depending upon the underlying neuromuscular disorder or institution. As an example, the threshold for VC was derived from studies of patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome. It is uncertain whether the VC is similarly helpful in patients with acute respiratory muscle weakness due to other peripheral neuromuscular diseases, such as myasthenia gravis [35]. The threshold value for MIP also varies depending upon the institution and country (eg, in Europe a cutoff <40 cm H2O is used).\n【60】 A \"20-30-40 rule\" has been proposed [23,30]. The rule advocates the initiation of ventilatory support when the VC is less than 20 mL/kg, the MIP is less negative than -30 cm H2O (eg, -20 cm H2O), or the MEP is less than 40 cm H2O. Prospective studies are needed to determine if this rule decreases the need for emergent intubation and improves overall outcome.\n【61】 ●In a randomized trial of 92 patients with ALS who had orthopnea (with MIP <60 percent of predicted) and/or symptomatic daytime hypercapnia, NIV plus standard care was compared with standard care alone [47]. NIV improved survival by 205 days in patients without bulbar involvement, while no survival benefit was noted in those with bulbar disease. Patients with bulbar dysfunction who received NIV had some quality of life improvement, but without a survival benefit.\n【62】 ●In a series of 71 patients with ALS treated with NIV for chronic respiratory failure, independent predictors of improved survival were tolerance of nocturnal NIV (risk ratio 0.32, 95% CI, 0.13-0.78) and a slower rate of decline of FVC [48]. Patients with mild or no bulbar symptoms were more likely to be tolerant of NIV.\n【63】 ●Diaphragmatic pacing (in addition to NIV) does not augment survival in patients with ALS [54,55]. These data are discussed separately. (See  \"Pacing the diaphragm: Patient selection, evaluation, implantation, and complications\".)\n【64】 Limited data in patients with respiratory muscle weakness from thoracic cage disease suggest a similar benefit:\n【65】 ●A prospective study of 244 patients with chronic respiratory failure due to kyphoscoliosis reported improved survival with home NIV compared with long-term oxygen therapy (hazard ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.18-0.51) [56].\n【66】 ●Small observational studies of patients with restrictive thoracic cage disease show improved sleep efficiency, stage N3 and/or rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during NIV [57-59].\n【67】 The exact mechanism by which nocturnal NIV can correct daytime hypoventilation in patients with neuromuscular and chest wall disease has not been fully elucidated. It is hypothesized that central chemoreceptor sensitivity may be restored by correction of profound nocturnal hypercapnia, or that the quality of sleep is changed when nocturnal NIV is employed [60,61]. Observational studies also suggest that nocturnal mechanical ventilation at least partially improves lung mechanics, respiratory muscle strength, or reduces ventilation‐perfusion mismatch, by day as well as night [41]. (See  \"Control of ventilation\".)\n【68】 Patients with nonprogressive myopathic or lower motor neuron lesions can be managed with NIV indefinitely. In contrast, patients with progressive upper motor neuron lesions, such as those with bulbar ALS or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), develop stridor and spastic upper airway collapse that can render NIV less effective and necessitate tracheostomy for continued survival. (See 'Tracheostomy' below.)\n【69】 Technical aspects of initiating NIV in patients with neuromuscular disease who have nocturnal hypoventilation or early chronic respiratory failure are discussed separately. (See  \"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Patient selection and alternative modes of ventilatory support\" and  \"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Practical aspects of initiation\" and  \"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Adaptation and follow-up after initiation\".)\n【70】 ●Indications – Indications include the following:\n【71】 In the chronic setting, the purpose of tracheostomy is chronic ventilation and/or secretion management as well ventilation for acute intercurrent illnesses. In the acute setting, the focus is also weaning to the point of decannulation and spontaneous breathing with or without NIV, although complete liberation from mechanical ventilation is not always achievable.\n【72】 ●Making the decision – While the decision to proceed with tracheostomy is best made prior to any acute event that might prompt invasive mechanical ventilation with an endotracheal tube, this may not always be feasible for patients who present unexpectedly with acute disease (eg, spinal trauma, Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic crisis). In addition, some patients change their mind over time or when faced with death in the near or immediate future. Thus, revisiting this decision is important during chronic care of these patients. (See  \"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with chronic respiratory failure from neuromuscular and chest wall diseases: Patient selection and alternative modes of ventilatory support\", section on 'Patient preferences' and  \"Noninvasive ventilatory support and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction\", section on 'Indications for tracheostomy' and  \"Advance care planning and advance directives\".)\n【73】 ●Outcomes (liberation and life expectancy) – Data describing outcome in tracheostomized patients with respiratory muscle weakness are limited. While patients with acute reversible etiologies, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome have a high likelihood of being liberated from mechanical ventilation, others with progressive neuromuscular disorders may not be as successful in weaning and end up partially or completely ventilator-dependent. In our experience, patients can survive for many years with a tracheostomy, although life-expectancy is likely limited when compared with spontaneously breathing patients who do not have a neuromuscular disorder.\n【74】 Predicting who will be successfully liberated and who will not is poorly studied and may be dependent upon factors including age, nature of the underlying illness, and presence of other comorbidities. In one retrospective study of 60 patients with ALS who underwent tracheostomy for failure to wean from mechanical ventilation, on discharge from the acute care facility, 70 percent were completely ventilator-dependent, 28 percent were partially ventilator-dependent and 1.6 percent were liberated from mechanical ventilation [62]. Liberation rates thereafter were not described, but survival rates were 65 percent at one year and 45 percent at two years after tracheostomy. Survival was significantly shorter in patients older than 60 years at the time tracheostomy was performed. Details regarding transitioning from tracheostomy to NIV are discussed separately. (See  \"Noninvasive ventilatory support and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction\" and  \"Noninvasive ventilatory support and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction\", section on 'Tracheostomy to noninvasive ventilatory support'.)\n【75】 ●Nutrition – Swallowing dysfunction is common after intubation and when a tracheostomy is present, even among patients without pre-existing neuromuscular disease. Many patients who require a tracheostomy long term for ventilation, also require enteral feeding via a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube, although some patients may be able to swallow safely with a tracheostomy in place within a stable chronic setting [63]. For patients with neuromuscular disorders who are successfully decannulated, an evaluation of bulbar function and swallowing should be undertaken before allowing them to eat [64]. (See  \"Noninvasive ventilatory support and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction\".)\n【76】 ●Disposition of service – Patients with respiratory muscle weakness who have a tracheostomy do not necessarily need a long term care facility indefinitely. Some patients can be chronically ventilated at home, provided appropriate support is available. (See  \"Noninvasive ventilatory support and mechanical insufflation-exsufflation for patients with respiratory muscle dysfunction\".)\n【77】 Technical details regarding tracheostomy placement are provided separately. (See  \"Tracheostomy: Rationale, indications, and contraindications\".)\n【78】 Interventions include mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MIE), manually assisted coughing, hyperinflation maneuvers for lung volume recruitment (LVR), and secretion clearance techniques. We generally prefer MIE, although it has not been directly compared to the other interventions and in many cases we use a combination of such therapies depending on the patient’s preference, muscle weakness group, (inspiratory and/or expiratory), cough and glottis strength, volume of secretions, and level of expertise [38,65].\n【79】 When prescribed, most are applied daily or twice daily. In the chronic setting, acceptance or adherence to these maneuvers is likely an issue that affects efficacy [66].\n【80】 Adequacy of cough can be determined by regularly measuring cough peak flow (PCF). Values >160 L/min are necessary for an effective cough to clear respiratory secretions. It has been suggested that a “baseline” PCF >270 L/min, when the patient is well, is required to maintain a PCF >160 L/min when the patient is unwell [67]. Assessing cough strength is mostly done as part of the diagnostic evaluation of respiratory muscle weakness but may also need to be monitored in those with progressive disease. (See  \"Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation\", section on 'Assessing cough strength'.)\n【81】 Using the same device, MIE can also be applied through an endotracheal or tracheostomy tube when patients are on a mechanical ventilator. However, higher insufflation pressures are generally used (eg, 60 to 70 cm H2O) to compensate for a drop in pressure across the endotracheal or tracheostomy tube.\n【82】 MIE can be used alone or in combination with manually assisted coughing (see 'Manual-assisted cough (abdominal thrust)' below). However, when MIE is administered at sufficiently high pressures (eg, 50 to 60 cm H2O), the concomitant abdominal thrusts from the manual assist maneuver usually do not further increase the exsufflation flow, and so, are probably not necessary.\n【83】 MIE is generally well tolerated with complications infrequently reported and can be used in the home [68]. Gastric distension and chest wall discomfort can occasionally occur. There are rare reports of pneumothorax [69].\n【84】 MIE may be less effective in patients who have expiratory airflow limitation (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) because it is associated with worsening expiratory airway collapse and a decrease in the PCF [70,71]. In addition, with disease progression and/or bulbar dysfunction, laryngeal dysfunction can result from MIE when higher inflation pressures are used (eg, laryngeal adduction during insufflation and hypopharyngeal collapse during exsufflation) [72]. With any of these circumstances, we lower MIE pressures, and if this is not effective, we use alternative cough augmentation maneuvers such as manually assisted coughing. (See 'Manual-assisted cough (abdominal thrust)' below.)\n【85】 Data to support the routine use of MIE, either during stable disease or during acute respiratory tract infections are limited to observation studies with minimal data describing its effect on clinically important outcomes such as disease progression, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or survival [73-79]:\n【86】 ●MIE plus chest physical therapy reduces treatment failure in patients with neuromuscular disease who have a respiratory tract infection, compared with historical controls managed with chest physical therapy alone [76].\n【87】 ●MIE via a tracheostomy tube is more effective at clearing respiratory secretions than tracheal suctioning in patients with ALS [77].\n【88】 ●MIE produces a greater increase in PCF than a manually assisted cough in some, but not all, studies [74,78].\n【89】 ●MIE improves physiologic parameters including vital capacity, peripheral oxygenation, exhaled tidal volume, and peak expiratory flow in patients with neuromuscular disease [79-81].\n【90】 ●Use of a protocol that included MIE (or other lung-assist devices) and manual assisted coughing lowered the hospitalization rate among patients with DMD [73].\n【91】 ●MIE has been shown to eliminate the need for deep airway suctioning and can return ambient air oxyhemoglobin saturation to normal when preparing patients for successful extubation or decannulation [82,83].\n【92】 The insufflation component of MIE can also be used for passive lung volume recruitment (LVR) which is discussed below. (See 'Lung volume recruitment (assisted inflation maneuvers)' below.)\n【93】 ●In patients who have expiratory muscle weakness, manual-assisted cough is effective as an isolated maneuver, and can be augmented when combined with insufflation techniques [84].\n【94】 ●In patients who have inspiratory muscle weakness (eg, when the vital capacity is 1.5 L or less), manual-assisted cough is insufficient as an isolated maneuver and should be combined with insufflation or recruitment maneuvers.\n【95】 ●Similarly, manual-assisted coughing may also not be sufficiently effective in the presence of severe scoliosis or severely impaired bulbar-innervated muscles.\n【96】 ●In addition, it should be avoided following meals due to the risk of aspiration and cannot be used in patients with abdominal trauma.\n【97】 LVR maneuvers can be device-assisted (active) or spontaneously performed (passive), none of which has been proven superior. With the exception of glossopharyngeal breathing, a manual resuscitator (eg, Ambu bag) or volume-cycled ventilator is typically used to deliver preset volumes for inflation; pressure-cycled ventilators cannot be used for LVR [85,86]. Delivered volumes are typically higher than a normal tidal volume and generally approach maximum lung insufflation capacity (ie, until the glottis can hold no additional air). This provides a greater volume of gas to be forced out during a cough, thereby also improving cough effectiveness. In LVR, exhalation is passive unless combined with manual-assisted coughing or exsufflation. Spontaneous LVR maneuvers such as glossopharyngeal breathing, require intact bulbar function for the patient to be able to retain the delivered tidal volume [87]. However, this is not an issue for LVR maneuvers delivered by a device through an endotracheal tube or tracheotomy tube.\n【98】 There are several ways to deliver LVR maneuvers, which include the following:\n【99】 ●Mechanical inspiration using a mechanical insufflator or a volume cycled ventilator – These device-assisted LVR maneuvers are especially useful for patients unable to stack breaths such as patients with poor bulbar dysfunction when glottis strength is inadequate to hold consecutively delivered air volumes [75].\n【100】 The insufflation component of MIE may be used for LVR. Alternatively, a volume-cycled ventilator (invasive or noninvasive) may be used to deliver a preset inspiratory tidal volume. Exhalation can be passive or assisted (eg, manual-assisted cough, exsufflation). Intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB) devices have also been used to deliver a set pressure to expand the lungs (and can also be used to deliver aerosolized medications); however, IPPB devices have largely been supplanted by NIV.\n【101】 ●Stacked breaths – Stacked breathing is initiation of inspiration before the completion of expiration. Glossopharyngeal (GPB) or \"frog breathing\" is a breath-stacking technique learned spontaneously by or taught to patients with respiratory muscle weakness [88]. To perform effective GPB, the upper airway and tongue musculature must be intact. Thus, the main users of GPB are a rapidly diminishing population of patients with post-polio syndrome, those with high cervical cord lesions, and others with neuromuscular diseases that spare the upper airway musculature. Some patients use GPB to become independent from mechanical ventilation for up to several hours at a time while awake. Others with progressive neuromuscular disease use it for prolonged periods to delay the eventual need for mechanical ventilation [89].\n【102】 During GPB, the patient performs gulping maneuvers that inject 50 to 60 mL boluses of air into the lungs. Each \"gulp\" takes 0.5 seconds and is repeated 10 to 12 times to achieve a normal tidal volume or maximal tolerated inspiratory capacity. The intake of tidal volume is repeated 10 times per minute for a total volume of 5 to 6 L/min.\n【103】 Delivery of stacked breaths can be also achieved using a manual resuscitation bag (eg, Ambu bag). Compression of the manual resuscitation bag transmits inspiratory pressure to the airways through an airtight oronasal mask or mouthpiece. Exhalation is prevented by either the one-way valve or the patient controlling their glottis. Once the maximum tolerated assisted inspiratory capacity is reached, passive exhalation to functional residual capacity or a spontaneous or assisted forced expiratory maneuver (eg, cough) follows. Breath-stacking can also be performed using a volume-cycled NIV device.\n【104】 Data to support the use of LVR are limited to observational series that mostly describe efficacy on surrogate outcomes such as inspiratory capacity and PCF with limited data to support an effect on concrete clinical outcomes (eg, pneumonia rate, hospitalizations, mortality). In reality, the efficacy likely varies, being effective for some and less effective for others [90]. However, identifying who benefits and who does not is unclear.\n【105】 ●In patients with DMD, two observational cohorts suggested slower rates of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) following the initiation of daily LVR (-4.5 versus -0.5 percent predicted per year) [86,91]. The PCF was unaffected by LVR. Similar results were seen in patients with multiple sclerosis treated with twice daily LVR [92].\n【106】 ●In a small randomized controlled trial of patients with ALS, no difference was found in the number of episodes of chest infection, duration of symptoms during each episode of infection, need for hospitalization, quality of life, or median survival when breath-stacking using a lung volume recruitment bag was compared to the mechanical insufflator-exsufflator [66].\n【107】 ●In 52 adult patients with DMD receiving NIV, no difference in cough effectiveness was seen when breath stacking from a home ventilator was compared with that generated from a lung volume recruitment bag [93].\n【108】 ●In 18 patients with severe respiratory muscle dysfunction from neuromuscular disease, PCFs were highest using a combination of LVR using a volume-cycled ventilator and manually assisted cough compared with either MIE or MIE combined with manually assisted cough [94].\n【109】 HFCWO is an external chest wall device that delivers oscillations to the chest using an inflatable vest that wraps around the chest. The device produces vibrations at variable frequencies and intensities, to facilitate expectoration. An intrapulmonary percussive ventilation device is a pneumatic device that can be connected to a face mask, mouthpiece, endotracheal tube or tracheostomy that intermittently delivers small tidal volumes at high frequencies (100 to 300 cycles per minute) creating percussions inside the lung. MIE is described above. (See 'Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation' above.)\n【110】 Some patients with neuromuscular disease can expect continued progression of their underlying disease process even with long term respiratory support (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy [DMD]), although the rate of disease progression varies. In this population, some patients may not choose permanent assisted ventilation with tracheostomy, based on issues related to quality of life and expectations of worsening disability, while others find it acceptable.\n【111】 Progressive neuromuscular diseases of childhood, such as spinal muscular atrophy and milder variants of DMD present different challenges. In these diseases, long-term ventilatory support is more common and often associated with good quality of life, and decisions are often made during childhood by parents. For these patients, as with adult patients, a clear understanding of the decision-maker’s expectations is essential.\n【112】 ●Respiratory muscle weakness can be commonly encountered among patients who have neuromuscular disease due to a variety of etiologies (table 1). Supportive management of respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease can provide symptomatic relief, improve quality of life, and in some cases, prolong life. In all cases, treatment of the underlying neuromuscular disorder is indicated, if feasible, although the response may vary depending on the specific disease entity. (See 'Introduction' above and 'Treatment of the underlying disorder' above.)\n【113】 ●Acute respiratory failure – Patients with respiratory muscle weakness may present with acute respiratory failure due to the underlying neuromuscular disease itself, a complication of their disease, or another intercurrent illness. Initial evaluation involves deciding whether the patient is suitable for noninvasive (NIV) or invasive ventilation. Indications for either form of ventilation in the acute setting are similar to those in the general population. However, the features of respiratory distress may be subtle such that the threshold for obtaining an arterial blood gas should be low. (See  \"Approach to the adult with dyspnea in the emergency department\" and  \"The evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the adult patient with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure\" and  \"Noninvasive ventilation in adults with acute respiratory failure: Benefits and contraindications\" and  \"The decision to intubate\".)\n【114】 ●Chronic respiratory failure – All patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency due to respiratory muscle weakness from neuromuscular disease should be evaluated for the need for ventilatory support, typically with NIV. Patients with progressive disease should be monitored clinically with pulmonary function tests (eg, every three to six months) and gas exchange parameters (eg, every six months) to determine the optimal time for initiating chronic ventilatory support. (See 'Chronic ventilatory support' above.)\n【115】 ●In patients with respiratory muscle weakness who have ineffective cough, we suggest the routine use of adjuncts to assist coughing for secretion clearance (Grade 2C). Benefits to support their routine use outside of this indication are unclear. Such adjuncts can be used in the chronic setting as well as during acute respiratory tract illnesses. They can also be used in spontaneously breathing or ventilated patients. (See 'Respiratory adjunctive therapy' above.)\n【116】 ●For patients with respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness from neuromuscular disease, it is particularly important for clinicians to understand the patients' values and goals for medical care (eg, restoring health, extending life, or relieving pain and suffering). We believe that discussions about patients’ desires regarding long-term care decisions are an integral part of the care of such patients. Palliative care teams can help to facilitate discussions regarding patients' goals and preferences and can provide ongoing care if the goals are to focus on palliation.

Frequency not defined.\n【21】 Central nervous system: Pyrexia\n【22】 Hematologic: Leukocytosis\n【23】 Local: Phlebitis\n【24】 Postmarketing and/or case reports: Coagulopathy, fibrin split products increased, hematocrit decreased, hypofibrogenemia, prothrombin time increased, partial thromboplastin time increased, thrombocytopenia\n【25】 Contraindications\n【26】 Hypersensitivity to hemin or any component of the formulation\n【27】 Warnings/Precautions\n【28】 • Anticoagulation: Transient, mild anticoagulation effects have been observed, although the extent and duration of hypocoagulation have not been determined. Avoid concurrent anticoagulation therapy.\n【29】 • Iron overload: Repeat administration cycles may result in iron overload; monitor iron and serum ferritin; consider iron chelation therapy if elevated.\n【30】 • Renal effects: Asymptomatic oliguria, increased nitrogen retention and reversible renal shutdown has been observed (case report) at a single dose above the recommended dose. Recommended dosage guidelines should be followed; worsening of renal function has not been observed with the recommended dose.\n【31】 • Porphyria: Clinical benefit depends on prompt administration. Porphyria attacks may progress to result in irreversible neuronal damage. Hemin is intended to prevent attacks from becoming critical; hemin is not effective in repairing neuronal damage resulting from attacks. After discontinuation, although remission may be prolonged, acute porphyria symptoms generally return.\n【32】 • Human plasma: Product of human plasma; may potentially contain infectious agents that could transmit disease, including a theoretical risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to Recordati Rare Diseases at 1-888-575-8344.\n【33】 • Latex: Packaging may contain natural latex rubber.\n【34】 • Appropriate use: Although the manufacturer's labeling recommends initial therapy with glucose (ie, 400 g/day for 1 to 2 days), glucose may be appropriate for mild cases only and hemin should be initiated early for most acute attacks, although glucose may be utilized while awaiting hemin therapy (Anderson 2005). For moderate to severe attacks, immediate hemin treatment is recommended. Follow recommended dosage; excessive single doses have resulted in reversible renal shutdown, with asymptomatic oliguria and increased nitrogen retention. Administer through a large vein (or central line) to prevent phlebitis.\n【35】 • Preparation in albumin: Reconstitution in albumin 25% (instead of sterile water for injection) is recommended to prevent formation of degradation byproducts and reduce phlebitis, as well as prevent transient coagulopathy/bleeding (Anderson 2006).\n【36】 Dosage Forms: US\n【37】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【38】 Solution Reconstituted, Intravenous [preservative free]:\n【39】 Panhematin: 350 mg (1 ea)\n【40】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【41】 No\n【42】 Pricing: US\n【43】 350 mg (per each): $12,167.51\n【44】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【45】 Solution Reconstituted, Intravenous:\n【46】 Panhematin: 268 mg (1 ea)\n【47】 Administration: Adult\n【48】 IV: For IV infusion only. Administer through a large vein or central line to prevent phlebitis. Preparing the solution in albumin has been reported to decrease phlebitis (Ref).\n【49】 Administration: Pediatric\n【50】 IV: Infuse over at least 30 minutes through a 0.45 micron or smaller filter since undissolved particulate will not be visible. Administer through a large vein or central line to prevent phlebitis. After infusion, flush with 100 mL of NS.\n【51】 Use: Labeled Indications\n【52】 Limitations of use: Before hemin administration, the manufacturer recommends an appropriate period of carbohydrate loading (ie, 400 g glucose/day for 1 to 2 days). However, glucose may be appropriate for mild cases only and hemin should be initiated early for most acute attacks, although glucose may be utilized while awaiting hemin therapy (Anderson 2005). For moderate to severe attacks, immediate hemin treatment is recommended. Porphyria attacks may progress to a point of irreversible neuronal damage; hemin therapy is intended to prevent an attack from reaching a critical stage of neuronal degeneration; hemin is not effective in repairing neuronal damage.\n【53】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【54】 None known.\n【55】 Drug Interactions\n【56】 (For additional information: Launch drug interactions program)\n【57】 Anticoagulants: Hemin may enhance the anticoagulant effect of Anticoagulants.  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【58】 Barbiturates: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Hemin. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【59】 Estrogen Derivatives: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Hemin. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【60】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【61】 Use of hemin for acute attacks of porphyria during pregnancy has been described (Anderson 2005; Marsden 2010; Stein 2013). Avoid use in severe pre-eclampsia (theoretical risk of potentiation of the coagulation disorder).\n【62】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【63】 It is not known if hemin is present in breast milk. According to the manufacturer, the decision to continue or discontinue breastfeeding during therapy should take into account the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother.\n【64】 Monitoring Parameters\n【65】 Prior to treatment: Urinary levels of porphobilinogen (PBG), delta aminolevulinic acid (ALA), and total porphyrin. (Note: Classical Watson-Schwartz or Hoesch tests are less reliable)\n【66】 During treatment: Urinary levels of ALA, uroporphyrin (UPG), PBG, and coproporphyrin; monitor iron and serum ferritin (if receiving multiple hemin doses). Monitor serum creatinine and electrolytes (including magnesium) daily; monitor vital capacity, neurologic status, including proximal muscle strength, monitor for bladder retention, monitor for signs/symptoms of progressing porphyria (Anderson 2005). In a study where hemin was prepared in albumin 25%, vital signs were monitored every 10 to 15 minutes during infusion and for 2 hours following infusion (Bonkovsky 1991).\n【67】 Mechanism of Action\n【68】 Limits hepatic and/or marrow porphyrin synthesis by inhibiting synthesis of aminolevulinic acid synthase, the enzyme that regulates the porphyrin/heme pathway\n【69】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【70】 Onset: Clinical improvement begins within 1 to 2 days if hemin is initiated early (Anderson 2005).\n【71】 Excretion: Feces; urine (as metabolites)\n【72】 Brand Names: International\n【73】 International Brand Names by Country", "title": "Hemin  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/hemin-drug-information?search=%E7%BA%A2%E7%BB%86%E8%83%9E%E7%94%9F%E6%88%90%E6%80%A7%E5%8D%9F%E5%95%89%E7%97%87&source=search_result&selectedTitle=65%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

The causes of travel-associated fever based on the interval since exposure are summarized in the table and figure (table 4 and figure 2).\n【14】 ●The nature of travel (including geographic region, travel dates, type of transportation, and nature of accommodations) – The patient should be asked specifically about travel to areas with malaria transmission (figure 3) and/or areas with ongoing outbreaks (such as viral hemorrhagic fevers or meningitis). In some circumstances, infection control precautions may be warranted based on clinical and exposure history before diagnostic results are available (table 5).\n【15】 ●Relevant activities and exposures (such as consumption of unclean water or undercooked food, insect bites, animal exposure, sexual contact). (See 'Consider the exposure history' below.)\n【16】 ●General medical information (including vaccination history, past medical history, and medications) – If malaria chemoprophylaxis was taken, the clinician should inquire as to the drug, the dose, the intervals between doses, and the duration of therapy prior to arrival and following departure from the transmission area.

(See 'Evaluate for malaria' above.)\n【23】 ●Enteric fever –\"Enteric fever\" refers to both typhoid fever (caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi [formerly S. typhi]) and paratyphoid fever (caused by S. enterica serotype Paratyphi A, B, and C worldwide). Enteric fever is characterized by abdominal pain, fever, and chills. Classic manifestations include relative bradycardia, pulse-temperature dissociation, and \"rose spots\" (faint salmon-colored macules on the trunk and abdomen). Hepatosplenomegaly, intestinal bleeding, and perforation may occur, leading to secondary bacteremia and peritonitis.

Violence in the media, intimate partner violence, and child abuse are discussed separately.\n【2】 OVERVIEW — Violence is a major cause of death and disability for American children. Violence or witnessing violence has both physical and psychiatric sequelae, including posttraumatic stress disorder, adjustment reactions, severe grief reactions, and depression [1].\n【3】 EPIDEMIOLOGY — The United States has the highest youth homicide rate among the 23 wealthiest nations [2]. Homicide is the third leading cause of death among 15- to 19-year-olds and the leading cause of death among Black youth [3].\n【4】 RESILIENCE FACTORS — Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and from the Vermont Youth Risk Behavior Survey each demonstrate powerful protective effects of youth engagement [14]. The NLSY analyses demonstrated that caregiver expectations and connectedness with parents, caregivers, and other adults and with school protected against violence. The results showed the power of these protective factors, even in the presence of substantial risk factors. Social assets can be measured on a population level using proprietary surveys developed by the Search Institute [15]. They describe several domains of positive developmental assets, community strengths, and self-reported attitudes and behaviors that protect against violence and drug use. In a now-classic paper, the Vermont Department of Public Health used similar constructs to add to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey. Their work showed there was an inverse correlation between measured assets and health risk behaviors [16]. In another nationally representative survey of 7th to 12h graders, higher educational aspirations were protective against weapon-related behaviors for Black and Latin American adolescents, and higher family connectedness was protective for Latin American adolescents [17].\n【5】 RISK FACTORS — Most serious violence-related injuries result when people who have learned to use violence to solve problems have access to weapons. Law enforcement agencies traditionally attempt to assign culpability in cases of violence, determining who was the victim and who was the perpetrator of a particular violent act. However, from a public health perspective, it most often emerges that both victims and perpetrators are caught in a culture of violence. Children and adolescents who fight regularly are at risk of severe injury.\n【6】 Physical discipline — The use of violent discipline methods teaches children that violence is an appropriate means of shaping behavior. Evidence strongly suggests that corporal punishment can set in motion a vicious cycle of increasing aggression met by further physical punishment [37-39]. Corporal punishment has been linked to later aggression, dating violence, and adult intimate partner violence [40-43]. Corporal punishment is largely ineffective [41]; children whose caregivers are unable to set effective limits may develop dysfunctional behavior patterns of interaction, particularly if corporal punishment is used extensively [44,45]. Dysfunctional interaction may lead to poor performance and social isolation in the early school years and, later, association with peer groups that reward violence and antisocial behavior [46].\n【7】 Access to firearms and weapon carrying — Having a firearm in the home is associated with increased risk of homicide, suicide, and unintentional injury. The carrying of weapons increases the risk of violent behavior and violence-related injury by providing a false sense of security that contributes to impulsive behavior [47,48]. It is estimated that approximately one-half of nonfatal firearm-related hospitalizations in children and adolescents are secondary to assault [49]. Safe storage of firearms (ie, locked up and unloaded, with ammunition locked separately) is associated with decreased risk of unintentional and suicide firearms deaths. Safe storage of firearms and other interventions to prevent firearm injury in children and adolescents are discussed separately. (See  \"Firearm injuries in children: Prevention\".)\n【8】 Alcohol/drug use — Substance abuse, which alters the dynamics and decisions in violent or near-violent episodes, is associated with an increased risk of exposure to violence, carrying weapons, and homicide among adolescents and street gangs [30,50-52]. Early onset of alcohol or drug use increases the risk of abuse-related violence that continues into adulthood. In one survey of more than 40,000 adults between 18 and 44 years of age, those who began drinking alcohol before age 14 years were 14 times more likely to report having been in an alcohol-related fight within the past year than those who began drinking after age 21 years [53].\n【9】 Gang participation — The National Youth Gang Survey (1996-2009) estimates that there are approximately 26,000 gangs and 775,000 gang members in the United States [54]. Children and adolescents who participate in gangs are more likely to promote aggressive attitudes, report victimization experiences, be involved in fights, carry weapons to school, and use drugs or alcohol at school [55-57]. They are also at risk for homicide at school. In Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance, gang-related activity was a common motive for single-victim and multiple-victim homicides at school [58].\n【10】 Witnessing violence — The witnessing of violence by children increases the risk that they will react violently later in life [59]. More than one-half of the six-year-old urban children living below the poverty threshold in a cross-sectional study of exposure to violence had witnessed some form of violence [60]. The children who witnessed violence had more behavioral, emotional, attention, and social problems than did those who did not. Chronic exposure to violence may lead to toxic stress, a syndrome associated with changes in brain development and resultant deficits in executive function [61].\n【11】 Intimate partner — Intimate partner violence and child abuse are the greatest risk factors for violence for infants and toddlers. Exposure to violence and victimization is associated with subsequent acts of violence by the witness [62,63]. Children who witness intimate partner violence are harmed cognitively, emotionally, and developmentally [64,65]. (See  \"Intimate partner violence: Childhood exposure\", section on 'Effects'.)\n【12】 Television/media violence — Children and adolescents in the United States spend an average of >2 hours per day watching television and at least six hours per day when all types of media are included (eg, movies, videos, digital music, video/computer/mobile games, social media, digital devices, etc) [66]. (See  \"Television and media violence\", section on 'Quantity of media violence exposure'.)\n【13】 Bullying — Bullying is the repeated infliction of harm on younger, smaller, or less powerful peers [69]. Almost 10 percent of students in grades 6 through 12 report having been bullied at school, school activities, or on the way to or from school [69,70]. Both the bully and the victim are affected by bullying. Effects on victims include physical injury, difficulty concentrating, physical symptoms (eg, nausea, anorexia), symptoms of anxiety or depression, poor self-esteem, and high rates of school absence [71-73]. Bullies, however, often feel powerful and effective. In contrast to the situation in childhood, the long-term outcome (at age 30 years) for bullies themselves is especially poor. They are more likely to be incarcerated and are less likely to be employed, married, or in other stable adult relationships than are their peers [74].\n【14】 Community violence — Studies conducted in poor urban neighborhoods identified a pattern of violence in which fighting and the willingness to fight are key components of a protective strategy for coping with dangerous environments [75]. Young people who are unwilling or unable to defend themselves are prey to multiple and repeated attacks in the \"code of the streets.\" Some caregivers understand this culture and may actually encourage their children to become able fighters to defend themselves. However, caregivers can play a crucial role in encouraging safe behavior. They can teach their children how to defuse tense situations [76,77]. Resources to help caregivers encourage safe behaviors are available through the American Academy of Pediatrics (eg, the \"Talking with your teen: Tips for parents\" and \"Staying cool when things heat up\" brochures) [76]. (See 'Resources' below.)\n【15】 SCREENING — Pediatric care providers should screen for violence and violence risk factors at routine health care visits. The screening questions depend upon the child's age and developmental stage and the cultural background of the family. In most cases, children may be asked directly whether they have been involved in or witness to any violence [11]. The assessment of family functioning, family stress, coping mechanisms, and support systems, always a key component of routine health care maintenance, is also an important dimension of preventing violence. Environmental factors, chiefly access to guns, should be assessed periodically. Finally, abrupt deterioration in school performance may indicate violence or a related health risk factor including bullying, depression, substance use, intimate partner violence, or family illness. Emotional and behavioral problems can be assessed using the Pediatric Symptom Checklist or the Child Behavior Checklist. (See  \"Developmental-behavioral surveillance and screening in primary care\", section on 'Choice of screening test'.)\n【16】 Adolescent screening — Violence clusters with other high-risk behaviors in adolescents. In addition to being questioned regarding drug use and sexual risk, all teenagers should be asked directly about violence. The \"FISTS\" questions help to identify those who are at risk of violence-related injury (table 1) [83]:\n【17】 Risk stratification — Additional information is used to assess the level of risk for violence-related injury in teenagers because risky behaviors tend to cluster [47,84-87].\n【18】 ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE — The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Medical Association recommend violence prevention counseling [90,91] (see  \"Guidelines for adolescent preventive services\", section on 'Anticipatory guidance for adolescents'). Children visit their health care provider frequently during infancy and early childhood. These visits furnish multiple opportunities for the provider to provide focused interventions toward prevention of violence. The provider can identify and attempt to modulate risk factors for violence. In addition, they can attempt to enhance the protective factors (eg, intact family structure, positive peer groups, self-esteem, and confidence). Pediatric health care providers can encourage caregivers to model nonviolent behavior, anger management, and conflict resolution for their children. In addition, children should be encouraged to participate in activities that are socially acceptable and build useful life skills [90].\n【19】 Firearms — Although the safest home for children is a home without guns, evidence suggests that there is incremental benefit in safer storage of firearms when they are present in the home. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance indicates that most of the firearms used in school-associated homicides were obtained from the perpetrator's home or the home of a relative or friend [93].\n【20】 Media — The AAP recommends that pediatric health care providers ask caregivers [94]:\n【21】 Intimate partner violence — Pediatric offices should provide information and support to adults who are experiencing intimate partner violence. Social work contacts and referral phone numbers should be available to providers and other office staff. Health care providers should be aware of the strong associations between intimate partner violence and child abuse [95], and of the long-term consequences of witnessing intimate partner violence. (See  \"Intimate partner violence: Childhood exposure\".)\n【22】 Age-specific anticipatory guidance — According to the AAP, health care providers can incorporate violence prevention into routine practice [90].\n【23】 Birth to four years — The pediatric health care visits from birth to age 4 years typically center on the establishment of good caregiver practices, environmental safety, and behavior concerns. These topics are related directly to violence prevention. Careful screening and support in the primary care setting is associated with measurable decreases in child maltreatment [96].\n【24】 Violence-free discipline — Family discipline patterns usually are established as children enter the second year of life. The AAP recommends that caregivers be encouraged and assisted in developing methods other than spanking to shape the behavior of their children [40].\n【25】 School-age — Families of school-aged children (5 to 12 years) should continue to be counseled regarding guns, television, and exposure to violence. In addition, the pediatric health care provider should ask about bullying and fighting in school.\n【26】 Adolescents — Teenagers and their caregivers should be educated about violence; in particular, they should know that:\n【27】 SECONDARY PREVENTION — Secondary prevention involves treatment, counseling, and referral for children and adolescents who have experienced violence-related injury. Children and adolescents who have been injured in a fight are at high risk for further violence, and crisis intervention is needed [88,102,103]. They should be asked:\n【28】 ADVOCACY — Youth violence is a serious health risk and complex social problem that requires broad-based public action for prevention. Pediatric health care providers, through the American Academy of Pediatrics and other organizations (eg, Children's Defense Fund), can advocate for social policies that benefit children. Violence prevention programs can be cost-effective and have lasting results [109,110].\n【29】 Individuals — Pediatric care providers advocate for their patients to receive the care and services that they need (eg, mental health service, family support). Individual adolescent patients may be encouraged to discover activities and social groups that promote the mastery of new skills and that lead to membership in prosocial groups. Adolescents who have experienced loss may benefit from grief counseling or specific evidence-based treatment for posttraumatic stress. Caregivers of teenaged patients should be advised to restrict access to firearms.\n【30】 Schools — School-based violence prevention programs are an effective means of reducing violent and aggressive behavior [111]. Pediatric consultants can help school systems reduce the incidence of violence. Middle and high school conflict resolution curricula have reduced the incidence of school fights and of suspensions or expulsions for fighting or weapon carrying. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's sourcebook provides detailed information concerning numerous innovative curricula developed and evaluated during the 1990s [112]. Peer mediator programs also reduce serious violence at and near schools and provide a model for nonviolent conflict resolution.\n【31】 Antibullying programs — Antibullying programs are effective in reducing bullying [74,112,114,115]. Successful programs work, in part, by mobilizing the large number of bystanders to make bullying less acceptable. Bullying at school is addressed through increased adult supervision before school, during lunch and recess, and after school, and through the development of classroom discussions to reduce the social acceptability of bullying among the majority of children, depriving the bully of an appreciative audience.\n【32】 Media — Pediatric health care providers can address violence in the media by endorsing community television \"tune-out weeks,\" encouraging schools to develop curricula for critical viewing skills, and working with local, state, and federal regulators and television producers to reduce the exposure of children to televised violence [116].\n【33】 Youth development — A variety of programs that provide resources for adolescents, including after-school programs, summer jobs programs, and programs that find ways for young persons to participate in the community, are associated with improved outcomes, including decreased risk of violence [78,117,118].\n【34】 Firearms — Pediatric health care providers can advocate for the prevention of firearm injury by supporting state and federal initiatives to mandate the provision of trigger locks and prevent the marketing of certain kinds of weapons. (See  \"Firearm injuries in children: Prevention\", section on 'Framework for prevention'.)\n【35】 RESOURCES\n【36】 SUMMARY", "title": "Peer violence and violence prevention", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/peer-violence-and-violence-prevention?search=%E5%88%87%E5%89%B2%E3%80%81%E7%A9%BF%E5%88%BA%E6%88%96%E6%92%95%E8%A3%82%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E6%8D%9F%E4%BC%A4%E6%88%96%E4%BC%A4%E5%AE%B3%E7%9A%84%E6%96%B9%E5%BC%8F&source=search_result&selectedTitle=129%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "uptodate", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}

The pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately, as are laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins.\n【8】 ●(See  \"Multiple myeloma: Pathobiology\".)\n【9】 ●(See  \"Multiple myeloma: Overview of management\".)\n【10】 ●(See  \"Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins\".)\n【11】 ●Annual incidence – Data from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry estimate 34,000 new cases of MM and 13,000 deaths from MM annually in the US. This correlates with an annual incidence of approximately 7 per 100,000 males and females per year [1-3]. A similar incidence has been reported in Canada, the South Thames area of the United Kingdom, and in Europe in general [4-7]. Worldwide, there are approximately 180,000 cases and 117,000 deaths per year attributed to MM (GLOBOCAN database).\n【12】 The true incidence appears to be stable [2,3,8]. While some reports have suggested an increase in incidence over time, this likely reflects an increased use of routine laboratory testing, greater awareness of MM, and the enhanced availability and use of medical facilities, especially by older persons. A database from Olmsted County, Minnesota, has documented a stable incidence from the 1940s to the early 21st century [3].\n【13】 ●Age and sex distribution – MM is largely a disease of older adults. The median age at diagnosis is 65 to 74 years; only 10 and 2 percent of patients are younger than 50 and 40 years, respectively [9,10]. MM is also slightly more frequent in men than in women (approximately 1.4:1).\n【14】 ●Variation with ethnicity – MM occurs in all races and all geographic locations [11]. The incidence varies by ethnicity; the incidence in African Americans and Black populations is two to three times that in White populations in studies from the United States and United Kingdom [9,12-14]. In contrast, the risk is lower in people from Japanese and in Mexicans [12,15].\n【15】 ●Risk factors – The risk of MM increases with body mass index [16-19]. There is also an association between Agent Orange exposure and MM. Data also suggest that among patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), there is an increased risk of progression to MM among those who have been exposed to Agent Orange [20].\n【16】 ●Familial risk – A small fraction of cases are familial with an estimated 3 familial cases per 1000 patients with MM [21-35]. The risk of developing MM is approximately 3.7-fold higher for persons with a first degree relative with MM [21,36]. In one report of 15 families with MM clustering, 10 occurred in siblings [31]. The same immunoglobulin G (IgG) kappa monoclonal pattern was present in all cases in seven families. In addition, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggested that persons with a common variation at the 3p22.1 or 7p15.3 genetic loci are at a slightly higher risk of developing MM (odds ratios of 1.32 and 1.38, respectively) [37]. While intriguing, such cases would be expected to account for less than 5 percent of familial risk. The low hazard ratios indicate that these markers do not have any direct clinical implications and reflect the complexity of the disease and the etiologic mechanism involved.\n【17】 The acronym \"CRAB\" is sometimes used to remember myeloma-defining events that are used in the diagnosis of MM: calcium elevation; renal insufficiency (kidney impairment); anemia; and bone disease.\n【18】 A retrospective analysis of 1027 sequential patients diagnosed with MM at a single institution found the following symptoms and signs at presentation [9]:\n【19】 ●Anemia – 73 percent\n【20】 ●Bone pain – 58 percent\n【21】 ●Elevated creatinine – 48 percent\n【22】 ●Fatigue/generalized weakness – 32 percent\n【23】 ●Hypercalcemia – 28 percent\n【24】 ●Weight loss – 24 percent, one-half of whom had lost ≥9 kg\n【25】 Symptoms and signs present in 5 percent or less included: paresthesias (5 percent), hepatomegaly (4 percent), splenomegaly (1 percent), lymphadenopathy (1 percent), and fever (0.7 percent). Pleural effusion and diffuse pulmonary involvement due to plasma cell infiltration are rare and usually occur in advanced disease. As the use of \"routine\" blood work has become more common, patients are being diagnosed earlier in the disease course.\n【26】 Sometimes MM is suspected based on an increased total serum protein level, most often in conjunction with other symptoms or signs suggestive of MM. However, the total serum protein level may be normal in patients with MM; this is especially common in those with light chain MM as the free light chains (FLC) seldom rise to a level that affects the total protein.\n【27】 Extramedullary plasmacytomas (EP) are seen in approximately 7 percent of patients with MM at the time of diagnosis and are best detected by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) scan; the presence of EP at diagnosis is associated with inferior survival. An additional 6 percent of patients will develop EP later in the disease course [38,39]. EP can present as large, purplish, subcutaneous masses (picture 1 and image 1) [40]. Plane xanthomas involving the creases of the palms and/or soles may represent a paraneoplastic phenomenon [41]. Cutaneous spicules, composed in part of the monoclonal (M) protein, may rarely occur [33]. There are also rare instances of ocular involvement, which can occur through direct infiltration of the eye or adjacent structures by tumor cells, hyperviscosity, or immunoglobulin deposits [42]. (See  \"Solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma\" and  \"Cutaneous manifestations of internal malignancy\".)\n【28】 ●Bone marrow replacement\n【29】 ●Relative erythropoietin deficiency (in part due to kidney damage)\n【30】 ●Dilution (in the case of a large M protein)\n【31】 Anemia commonly results in complaints of fatigue and pallor seen on physical examination.\n【32】 Macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] >100 fL) with low vitamin B12 levels (<200 ng/L) is seen in a minority of patients with MM (11 to 14 percent in two studies) [9,34]. While the mechanism for low vitamin B12 levels in these patients is not known, evaluation for other causes (eg, pernicious anemia) is indicated. (See  \"Macrocytosis/Macrocytic anemia\", section on 'Evaluation'.)\n【33】 In the same study described above, MM-related bone pain was present at the time of diagnosis in approximately 60 percent of patients [9]. MM-related pain typically:\n【34】 ●Involves the central skeleton (back, neck, shoulders, pelvis, hip), rather than the extremities\n【35】 ●Is often induced by movement and is less common at night during sleep though can occur with change of position\n【36】 ●Is usually mild or moderate in intensity but is severe in up to 10 percent\n【37】 The patient's height may be reduced by several inches because of vertebral collapse. Bone pain may also reflect plasma cell tumors (ie, plasmacytomas), which can present as expanding tumor emanating from bone or as non-osseous soft tissue masses.\n【38】 Two major causes of kidney impairment in patients with MM are light chain cast nephropathy (also called myeloma kidney) and hypercalcemia. Patients who do not secrete light chains are not at risk for myeloma kidney. In the absence of other causes of kidney failure, a presumptive diagnosis of light chain cast nephropathy can be made in the setting of high involved FLC levels. In contrast, kidney biopsy should be performed to characterize the histologic changes in patients with other potential risk factors for kidney impairment, in whom the mechanism of kidney injury is not known with certainty [44]. (See  \"Kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies: Etiology and evaluation\".)\n【39】 Other causes of kidney failure in a patient with MM include concurrent light chain (AL) amyloidosis, light chain deposition disease, and drug-induced kidney damage. Kidney disease in MM is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"Kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies: Etiology and evaluation\".)\n【40】 Of note, severe hypercalcemia can act as an unmeasured cation and thereby result in a low anion gap. A decreased anion gap may also be due to the presence of a cationic IgG molecule. (See  \"Serum anion gap in conditions other than metabolic acidosis\".)\n【41】 ●Extradural spinal cord compression – Spinal cord compression from an extramedullary plasmacytoma (image 2) or a bone fragment due to fracture of a vertebral body (image 3) occurs in approximately 5 percent of patients; it should be suspected in patients presenting with severe back pain along with weakness or paresthesias of the lower extremities, or bladder or bowel dysfunction or incontinence.\n【42】 This set of symptoms constitutes a medical emergency; magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomographic myelography of the entire spine must be performed immediately, with appropriate follow-up treatment by chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or neurosurgery to avoid permanent paraplegia. (See  \"Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression\" and  \"Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression\".)\n【43】 ●Hyperviscosity – Rare cases of hyperviscosity have been reported, usually in association with immunoglobulin M (IgM) MM [46]. Symptomatic hyperviscosity is a medical emergency. This syndrome is characterized by oronasal bleeding, blurred vision, neurologic symptoms, confusion, and/or heart failure. Serum viscosity measurements do not correlate well with symptoms or the clinical findings. Therapeutic plasma exchange promptly relieves the symptoms and should be performed regardless of the viscosity level if the patient is experiencing symptoms believed to be related to hyperviscosity [47]. (See  \"Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology\".)\n【44】 ●Radiculopathy – Radiculopathy, usually in the thoracic or lumbosacral area, is the most common neurologic complication of MM. It can result from compression of the nerve by a paravertebral plasmacytoma or by the collapsed bone itself in the case of a vertebral body compression fracture.\n【45】 ●Peripheral neuropathy – MM-related peripheral neuropathy is uncommon in MM at the time of initial diagnosis and, when present, is usually due to coexisting AL amyloidosis. An exception to this general rule occurs in the infrequent subset of patients with POEMS syndrome (osteosclerotic myeloma), a condition in which neuropathy occurs in all patients. The pathogenesis of the neuropathy is uncertain in POEMS but a paraneoplastic mechanism may be important; this issue is discussed separately. (See  \"POEMS syndrome\".)\n【46】 ●Central nervous system involvement – True intracranial plasmacytomas are rare, and most often plasmacytomas involving the brain parenchyma represent extensions of myelomatous lesions of the skull or plasmacytomas involving the clivus or base of the skull. Leptomeningeal myelomatosis along with abnormal cerebrospinal fluid findings is uncommon but is being recognized more frequently, especially in advanced stages of the disease [48-53]. When found it denotes a poor prognosis with survival historically measured in months despite treatment [52]. It is usually associated with high-risk cytogenetics; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels may be elevated. Survival appears to have improved slightly since the incorporation of immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors into first-line therapy [54-56].\n【47】 ●Encephalopathy due to high ammonia – Rare cases of encephalopathy due to high blood levels of ammonia, in the absence of liver involvement, have been reported [57-59]. Myeloma cell lines developed from such patients produce elevated amounts of ammonia, although the mechanism is unclear [60]. Ammonia levels and the patient's state of consciousness return to normal if and when the underlying myeloma responds to chemotherapy.\n【48】 Further details of immunodeficiency due to MM and infections in patients with MM are discussed separately. (See  \"Infections in patients with multiple myeloma\".)\n【49】 SPEP will demonstrate a localized band or peak in approximately 80 percent of patients with MM [9]. Addition of serum protein immunofixation increases the sensitivity to over 90 percent. If, in addition, either the serum FLC assay or urine M protein studies (UPEP and urine immunofixation) are done, the sensitivity increases to 97 percent or more. Patients without detectable M protein by SPEP, UPEP, immunofixation, and FLC analysis are considered to have \"nonsecretory myeloma.\" (See 'Nonsecretory myeloma' below.)\n【50】 Among the 20 percent with no localized band on SPEP, most of whom have light chain MM, approximately one-half will have hypogammaglobulinemia due in part to suppression of normal gamma globulin production.\n【51】 Mass spectrometry (MS) is being evaluated as a technique to evaluate for and quantify the M-protein. MS and other laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins in the serum and urine are discussed in more detail separately (table 1). (See  \"Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins\".)\n【52】 ●Presence of a monoclonal protein – The M protein usually presents as a single narrow peak, like a church spire, in the gamma, beta, or alpha-2 region of the densitometer tracing (figure 1), or as a dense, discrete band on the agarose gel (image 4). Infrequently, two M proteins are present (biclonal gammopathy) (figure 2). Serum immunofixation confirms the presence of an M protein and determines its type (figure 3). (See  \"Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins\".)\n【53】 ●Suppression of uninvolved immunoglobulins (immunoparesis) – The level of one or both of the major uninvolved immunoglobulins (ie, IgM and IgA in the case of IgG myeloma) is reduced in 91 percent of patients overall, and both are reduced in 73 percent. Normal levels of the uninvolved immunoglobulins are present at diagnosis in 3, 8, 12, and 13 percent of patients with IgA, nonsecretory, IgG, and light chain myeloma, respectively [9]. In one study, patients with MM had lower median levels of IgE (11 international units [IU]/mL) than normal subjects (38 IU/mL) [61].\n【54】 When interpreting the FLC assay in clinical practice, clinicians should refer to the normal reference range specified by the laboratory reporting the result. Reference ranges differ between assays from different manufacturers and are dependent upon the instrument used for measurement. Reference ranges may also be adjusted for the patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate. (See  \"Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins\", section on 'Serum free light chains'.)\n【55】 Patients with otherwise asymptomatic myeloma who have an involved/uninvolved FLC ratio of ≥100 have a risk of progression to end-organ damage in the next two years that has been reported to be as high as 70 to 80 percent [64-66]. In these patients, if the absolute involved FLC level was also ≥100 mg/dL (1000 mg/L), the risk of progression in the next two years increased to 93 percent. Given the high rate of progression, an FLC ratio ≥100 in conjunction with an involved FLC level of ≥10 mg/dL (100 mg/L) is considered diagnostic of MM [67].\n【56】 ●IgG – 52 percent\n【57】 ●IgA – 21 percent\n【58】 ●Kappa or lambda light chain only (Bence Jones) – 16 percent\n【59】 ●IgD – 2 percent\n【60】 ●Biclonal – 2 percent\n【61】 ●IgM – 0.5 percent\n【62】 ●Negative (nonsecretory or oligo-secretory MM) – 6.5 percent\n【63】 The prevalence of non-secretory myeloma has decreased since then with routine use of the FLC assay. Kappa is the predominant light chain isotype compared with lambda, by a factor of 2 to 1 with the exception that lambda light chains are more common in IgD myeloma and MM associated with amyloidosis (figure 4) [68].\n【64】 The incidence of kidney failure is significantly higher in light chain MM, as the serum creatinine is ≥2 mg/dL (177 micromol/L) in approximately one-third of these patients at presentation. (See  \"Kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies: Etiology and evaluation\".)\n【65】 ●Serum M protein <1 g/dL, and\n【66】 ●Urine M protein <200 mg/24 hours\n【67】 Monitoring of oligo-secretory MM can be challenging using SPEP and UPEP since it is difficult to determine if small variations are real or due to expected laboratory variability. The FLC ratio is often abnormal in patients with oligo-secretory MM, making the serum FLC assay an important method of assessing and monitoring disease [69]. Patients can also be monitored using imaging and bone marrow studies, particularly if the baseline FLC levels are normal or only minimally elevated (<10 mg/dL).\n【68】 ●Normal serum and urine immunofixation\n【69】 ●Normal serum FLC ratio\n【70】 The majority of nonsecretory MM (approximately 85 percent) will have M protein that can be detected in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic plasma cells by immunochemistry but have impaired secretion of this protein. The other 15 percent do not have immunoglobulin detectable in the plasma cells (ie, non-producer MM). Patients with true nonsecretory MM need to be monitored mainly on the basis of imaging tests and bone marrow evaluation. Patients with nonsecretory MM are not at risk for myeloma kidney, but they are at risk for other complications of MM, including kidney impairment related to other mechanisms such as hypercalcemia.\n【71】 In a Mayo Clinic study that assessed outcomes of 124 patients diagnosed with MM who had no M protein detected on serum and urine immunofixation at diagnosis and on all subsequent follow-up testing, progression-free survival and overall survival were similar to if not slightly better than those observed in patients with secretory myeloma [71].\n【72】 Although not a laboratory artifact, M protein can increase the serum viscosity and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). The ESR is >20 mm/hour in 84 percent, and >100 mm/hour in one-third of patients with MM.\n【73】 Findings on urinalysis in MM depend on the etiology of the kidney damage:\n【74】 ●Myeloma cast nephropathy is characterized by the presence of large, waxy, laminated casts in the distal and collecting tubules; the casts are mainly composed of precipitated monoclonal light chains (picture 2A-C). The urine dipstick is typically negative for protein since most of the proteinuria is comprised of urinary M protein (Bence Jones proteinuria) rather than albumin.\n【75】 ●In contrast to myeloma cast nephropathy, kidney involvement in other related plasma cell disorders, namely AL amyloidosis and light chain deposition disease, is typically associated with a markedly positive dipstick for protein, since most of the urinary protein is comprised of albumin (nephrotic syndrome). Bence Jones proteinuria is minimal.\n【76】 Cast nephropathy and amyloidosis rarely occur in the same patients because the biochemical characteristics of the individual monoclonal light chain are an important determinant of the type of kidney disease that may be seen. (See  \"Kidney disease in multiple myeloma and other monoclonal gammopathies: Etiology and evaluation\".)\n【77】 ●Rouleaux formation (>50 percent)\n【78】 ●Leukopenia (20 percent)\n【79】 ●Thrombocytopenia (5 percent)\n【80】 Rouleaux formation is the phenomenon when red cells take on the appearance of a stack of coins in diluted suspensions of blood and is seen in patients with elevated serum protein levels (picture 3). Rarely, the peripheral smear may demonstrate a leukoerythroblastic reaction (ie, the combined presence of tear drop-shaped red cells, circulating nucleated red cells, and early white cells). (See  \"Evaluation of the peripheral blood smear\", section on 'Initial approach'.)\n【81】 Clonal plasma cells are rarely seen in the peripheral smear in patients with MM; a detectable absolute peripheral blood plasma cell count ≥100 cells/microL (≥0.1 x 109/L) is found in approximately 10 percent (picture 4). Plasma cell leukemia, a rare yet aggressive form of MM characterized by high levels of plasma cells circulating in the peripheral blood, should be considered whenever circulating plasma cells are readily detected on conventional complete blood count evaluation. (See  \"Plasma cell leukemia\".)\n【82】 Circulating clonal plasma cells can be detected using a slide-based immunofluorescence assay, a two-color immunoassay technique (ELISPOT), or flow cytometry by gating on CD38+/CD45- cells. Using these sensitive techniques, circulating monoclonal plasma cells can be identified in the majority of patients with MM; the absolute percentage depends on the sensitivity of the test used. (See  \"Multiple myeloma: Staging and prognostic studies\", section on 'Extramedullary disease'.)\n【83】 The bone marrow plasma cells can be estimated from [67]:\n【84】 ●Core biopsy using hematoxylin and eosin stain\n【85】 ●Aspirate using Wright's stain\n【86】 Core biopsy specimens are preferred. However, if the percent plasma cells in the aspirate and core biopsy differ, the higher value should be used. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry for CD138, kappa light chains, or lambda light chains should not be used to determine bone marrow plasma cell percentage as background staining and other technical issues can overestimate the result.\n【87】 Clonality should be established by showing a kappa/lambda light chain restriction on flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or immunofluorescence. The percentage clonal plasma cells identified impacts the likelihood of diagnosis:\n【88】 ●≥60 percent – Diagnostic of MM regardless of other findings [67]. Asymptomatic patients with ≥60 percent clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow have a risk of progression to end-organ damage in the next two years of greater than 80 percent and a median progression-free survival of approximately seven months [72,73].\n【89】 ●>10 to <60 percent – Found in the vast majority of patients with MM, but not diagnostic of overt myeloma in the absence of related organ or tissue impairment or identification of a biomarker.\n【90】 ●<10 percent – Due to patchy bone marrow involvement, bone marrow aspirate and biopsy may show <10 percent plasma cells in approximately 4 percent of patients [9].\n【91】 A diagnosis of MM can be made in patients with less than 10 percent clonal plasma cells on biopsy if other diagnostic criteria are fulfilled and after histopathologic confirmation of a soft tissue or bony plasmacytoma [15]. Since bone marrow involvement may be more focal than diffuse, some patients may require bone marrow aspirate/biopsy from several different sites or an image-guided biopsy of a focal lesion in order to establish the diagnosis.\n【92】 ●Morphology – The morphologic features of plasma cells can differ depending on their maturity and, at times, they may be morphologically indistinguishable from myeloblasts. Mature plasma cells are oval with abundant basophilic cytoplasm (picture 5). The nucleus is round and eccentrically located with a marked perinuclear hof, or cytoplasmic clearing (picture 4). The nucleus contains \"clock-face\" or \"spoke wheel\" chromatin without nucleoli. Immature plasma cells have dispersed nuclear chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio.\n【93】 The cytoplasm of myeloma cells may contain condensed or crystallized cytoplasmic immunoglobulin resulting in the following unusual findings, which are not limited to MM [74]:\n【94】 ●Immunophenotype – Immunohistochemical staining, immunofluorescent studies, and flow cytometry can be used to determine the immunophenotype of bone marrow plasma cells in patients with MM. Key features include [74]:\n【95】 The normal kappa/lambda ratio in the bone marrow is 2:1. A ratio of more than 4:1 or less than 1:2 is considered to meet the definition of kappa or lambda monoclonality, respectively. This finding distinguishes the monoclonal gammopathies from reactive plasmacytosis. (See 'Reactive plasmacytosis' below.)\n【96】 In contrast to normal plasma cells that usually express CD19, myeloma cells infrequently express CD19. CD45 expression is variable, with most myeloma cells typically being CD45 negative. Approximately 70 percent of myeloma cells will express CD56, which is typically negative in normal plasma cells and in plasma cell leukemia. (See  \"Plasma cell leukemia\".)\n【97】 These tests are also appropriate in patients receiving intensive therapies to monitor disease response. (See  \"Multiple myeloma: Evaluating response to treatment\", section on 'Imaging'.)\n【98】 ●Whole body low dose computed tomography (CT) without contrast\n【99】 ●Whole body combined fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT)\n【100】 ●Whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (or at a minimum MRI of the spine and pelvis)\n【101】 All three modalities are more sensitive than plain radiographs for the detection of most skeletal lesions in MM. A choice among these depends on availability, cost, institutional preference, and clinical features as follows:\n【102】 ●Newly diagnosed MM – At centers where it is available as a standard imaging technique, whole body low dose CT can be used as a baseline assessment of bone involvement. CT is quick, convenient, relatively sensitive, and cost effective in this scenario.\n【103】 ●Suspected smoldering MM – For patients with suspected smoldering MM (no bone lesions on CT and no other myeloma-defining features), whole body MRI or MRI of the spine and pelvis are used to confirm the absence of bone lesions, especially if there is a high percentage of bone marrow plasma cells or other concerning features. MRI is more sensitive than CT and PET/CT for focal bone marrow lesions and has no radiation exposure, but it is more cumbersome for the patient.\n【104】 ●Suspected extramedullary disease – For patients with suspected extramedullary disease outside of the spine, whole body PET/CT is particularly useful, as it appears to be more sensitive for the detection of extramedullary disease but is associated with greater radiation exposure and cost. MRI is preferred for patients with spinal involvement and concern for cord compression.\n【105】 In addition, either MRI or PET/CT scan should be performed routinely before making the diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma or smoldering MM [67,77-79]. (See 'Diagnostic criteria' below.)\n【106】 Support for each of these modalities is presented below:\n【107】 ●CT – Patients who previously would have met criteria for smoldering MM based on negative skeletal surveys, but who have lesions detected by CT, have a shorter time to progression than similar patients with negative CT imaging. This was illustrated in a retrospective analysis of 212 patients with histologically proven MM who had both a whole body CT and a skeletal survey obtained within 30 days of each other [80]. Approximately two-thirds had no lytic lesions detected using either modality or had lesions detected with both modalities. When compared to those with negative imaging, the 54 patients with lesions detected by CT only had a shorter time to symptomatic progression.\n【108】 ●PET/CT – PET/CT scanning using fluorine-18-labeled (18F) FDG is more sensitive and specific than skeletal survey for the detection of bone lesions and may be more sensitive than CT for the detection of extramedullary disease [81-85]. False negative results can occur in those with hyperglycemia or in the setting of high dose steroids. In a study prospectively comparing PET/CT versus MRI of the spine and pelvis versus skeletal survey, PET/CT was superior to skeletal survey for the detection of bone lesions and was able to detect bone changes in sites out of the MRI field in one-third of patients, while MRI was more sensitive than PET/CT for the detection of diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow by plasma cells [86].\n【109】 ●MRI – MRI is highly sensitive for the detection of bone and bone marrow focal lesions and predictive of progression. Unlike CT and PET/CT, MRI can detect focal bone lesions that are not yet lytic (ie, without advanced cortical bone destruction). Up to half of patients without other evidence of end-organ damage with normal plain films may demonstrate tumor-related lesions on MRI [87-89]. Patients with otherwise asymptomatic MM who have more than one focal bone lesion (≥5 mm) on MRI have a risk of progression to end-organ damage in the next two years of greater than 80 percent [90-92].\n【110】 In one study in which 611 patients with MM had both MRI (limited to the axial bone marrow) as well as a standard metastatic bone survey, MRI detected focal lesions in 52 percent of those with negative bone surveys, while bone surveys detected focal lesions in 20 percent of those with a negative MRI [87]. Significantly higher proportions of patients had focal lesions detected on MRI in the spine, pelvis, and sternum, while bone surveys outperformed MRI for lesions in the ribs and long bones.\n【111】 Among patients with moderate to advanced kidney failure (dialysis-dependent or estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min), the gadolinium administration should be avoided if possible due to an increased risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. This issue and the role of hemodialysis after the procedure if gadolinium-based imaging must be performed are discussed separately. (See  \"Patient evaluation before gadolinium contrast administration for magnetic resonance imaging\", section on 'Approach to preventing nephrogenic systemic fibrosis' and  \"Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced kidney disease\", section on 'Prevention'.)\n【112】 Conventional skeletal surveys reveal punched-out lytic lesions (image 5 and image 6), diffuse osteopenia (image 7), or fractures in nearly 80 percent of patients with MM at the time of diagnosis (table 2) [9,94,95]. Focal lytic lesions are found in nearly 60 percent; osteoporosis, pathologic fractures, or compression fractures of the spine each occur in approximately 20 percent of patients. The most frequent sites of involvement include areas with active hematopoiesis, such as the vertebral bodies, skull, thoracic cage, pelvis, and proximal humeri and femora. Osteosclerotic lesions (ie, areas of intense increased bone density) are rare. (See 'POEMS syndrome' below and  \"POEMS syndrome\".)\n【113】 ●An increased total serum protein concentration and/or the presence of a monoclonal (M) protein in the serum or urine\n【114】 ●Acute kidney failure with a bland urinalysis or rarely the nephrotic syndrome due to concurrent primary amyloidosis\n【115】 Major delays in diagnosis have been associated with a negative impact on the disease course [96]. The urgency of evaluation of suspected MM is guided by the presenting signs and symptoms. While the presentation is usually subacute, a small percentage of patients present acutely with findings that require immediate hospitalization with urgent evaluation and intervention. This includes patients with spinal cord compression, acute kidney failure, severe hypercalcemia, and/or hyperviscosity. Asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients can be evaluated as outpatients.\n【116】 We perform the following laboratory studies as an initial screen to look for MM (algorithm 1) [97-100]:\n【117】 ●Complete blood count\n【118】 ●Serum calcium and creatinine\n【119】 ●Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) with immunofixation\n【120】 ●Serum free light chain (FLC) assay\n【121】 ●Quantitative immunoglobulins\n【122】 Further studies are dependent upon these results:\n【123】 ●Urine studies – A routine urinalysis and 24-hour collection for electrophoresis (UPEP), immunofixation, and measurement of total urine protein concentration is indicated if initial studies demonstrate a monoclonal (M) protein on SPEP and/or immunofixation, and/or an abnormal FLC ratio plus increased FLC level on serum FLC assay.\n【124】 This 24-hour urine collection at the time diagnosis is important to establish a baseline M protein level and to evaluate for nephrotic range proteinuria, a finding that may be due to coexisting light chain deposition disease (LCDD) or AL amyloidosis. (See 'AL amyloidosis and light chain deposition disease' below.)\n【125】 ●Bone marrow evaluation – Bone marrow evaluation is indicated for all patients with suspected end organ damage (eg, anemia, kidney impairment, and/or hypercalcemia), and most other persons with evidence of a monoclonal protein. For such patients, we perform a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy with immunophenotyping, conventional cytogenetics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with examination of the peripheral smear.\n【126】 Bone marrow evaluation may be omitted in the following low-risk scenarios unlikely to represent MM: IgG M protein <1.5 g/dL (15 g/L) with normal FLC ratio; light chain only M protein with FLC ratio <8; and IgM M protein <1.5 g/dL (15 g/L). (See  \"Diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance\", section on 'Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy'.)\n【127】 ●Imaging – Cross-sectional imaging (CT, PET/CT, or MRI) is indicated for all patients with a non-IgM M protein and suspected end organ damage (eg, anemia, kidney impairment, and/or hypercalcemia), and most other persons with non-IgM M protein.\n【128】 Imaging may be omitted in the following low-risk scenarios unlikely to represent MM: IgG M protein <1.5 g/dL (15 g/L) with normal FLC ratio; light chain only M protein with FLC ratio <8; and IgM M protein and no clinical concern for bone lesions or myeloma. A choice among modalities depends on availability, cost, institutional preference, and clinical features. (See 'Choice of modality' above.)\n【129】 ●Additional studies – Serum albumin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) are measured at the time of diagnosis for staging and prognostic purposes. (See  \"Multiple myeloma: Staging and prognostic studies\".)\n【130】 Serum viscosity should be measured if the M protein concentration is high (ie, >5 g/dL) or there are symptoms suggestive of hyperviscosity. (See  \"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Waldenström macroglobulinemia\", section on 'Hyperviscosity syndrome'.)\n【131】 The diagnosis of MM requires fulfillment of the following criterion:\n【132】 ●Clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥10 percent or biopsy-proven bony or soft tissue plasmacytoma – Clonality should be established by showing a kappa/lambda light chain restriction on flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, or immunofluorescence. Bone marrow plasma cell percentage should be estimated from a core biopsy specimen, when possible. If there is disparity between the aspirate and core biopsy, the highest value should be used. Approximately 4 percent of patients may have fewer than 10 percent bone marrow plasma cells since marrow involvement may be focal, rather than diffuse. Repeat bone marrow biopsy should be considered in such patients.\n【133】 Plus one of the following:\n【134】 ●Presence of related organ or tissue impairment (often recalled by the acronym CRAB) – End-organ damage is suggested by increased plasma calcium level, renal insufficiency (kidney impairment), anemia, and bone lesions. In order to be included as diagnostic criteria, changes in these factors must be felt to be related to the underlying plasma cell proliferative disorder. (See  \"Multiple myeloma: Overview of management\", section on 'Verify the diagnosis'.)\n【135】 For these purposes, the following definitions are used:\n【136】 Manifestations of non-CRAB end-organ damage (eg, hyperviscosity, recurrent bacterial infections, AL amyloidosis, peripheral neuropathy) are nonspecific and not diagnostic of MM.\n【137】 ●Presence of a biomarker associated with near inevitable progression to end-organ damage (often recalled by the acronym \"SLiM,\" representing \"Sixty,\" \"Light chain ratio,\" MRI) – One or more of the following:\n【138】 Most but not all patients will have an M protein in serum (figure 1 and figure 3) and/or urine (figure 5 and figure 6). Approximately 40 percent of patients with symptomatic MM will have an M protein <3 g/dL. In true nonsecretory MM (approximately 3 percent of MM), an M protein will not be detectable in the serum or urine with immunofixation. (See  \"Laboratory methods for analyzing monoclonal proteins\".)\n【139】 Multiple myeloma is also included in the lymphoid malignancies sections of the International Consensus Classification (ICC) [101] and the World Health Organization 5th edition [102]. The ICC classification includes a subclassification of \"multiple myeloma with recurrent genetic abnormality,\" which includes subgroups for MM with CCND family translocations, MAF family translocations, NSD2 translocation, and hyperdiploidy [101].\n【140】 The main conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis of MM are monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) [103], Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM), solitary plasmacytoma, primary amyloidosis (AL), POEMS syndrome, and metastatic carcinoma (table 4 and table 5). Distinguishing features of these conditions are listed below.\n【141】 ●Serum monoclonal (M) protein (whether IgA, IgG, or IgM) <3 g/dL\n【142】 ●Clonal bone marrow plasma cells <10 percent\n【143】 ●Absence of lytic lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, and kidney impairment (end-organ damage) that can be attributed to the plasma cell proliferative disorder\n【144】 MGUS carries a risk of progression to MM of approximately 1 percent per year [104]. Differentiation of MGUS from MM can be difficult and is primarily based on presence or absence of related end-organ damage (table 6). In comparison to overt MM or plasma cell leukemia, most patients with MGUS or SMM have few or no circulating monoclonal plasma cells. The use of other clinical and laboratory factors to differentiate between these two entities is discussed in more detail separately. (See  \"Diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance\", section on 'Multiple myeloma'.)\n【145】 ●M protein ≥3 g/dL and/or 10 to 60 percent bone marrow plasma cells, plus\n【146】 ●No end-organ damage or other myeloma-defining events, and no amyloidosis (table 3) [67]\n【147】 Thus, for the diagnosis of SMM, patients should not have any of the following myeloma-defining events:\n【148】 ●End-organ damage (lytic lesions, anemia, kidney disease, or hypercalcemia) that can be attributed to the underlying plasma cell disorder\n【149】 ●≥60 percent clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow [72,73]\n【150】 ●Involved/uninvolved free light chain (FLC) ratio of 100 or more [64-66]\n【151】 ●Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with more than one focal lesion (involving bone or bone marrow) [90-92]\n【152】 Asymptomatic patients with one or more of the myeloma-defining events listed above are considered to have MM rather than SMM because they have a risk of progression with complications of greater than 80 percent within two years [67]. (See 'Diagnostic criteria' above.)\n【153】 If there are doubts about the differentiation of MGUS/SMM from MM, and whether to begin chemotherapy immediately, one should withhold treatment and re-evaluate in two or three months. Patients with SMM may remain stable for prolonged periods. (See  \"Smoldering multiple myeloma\".)\n【154】 In most cases, the distinction between WM and MM is straightforward since the clinical features are different, and the type of M protein seen in WM (IgM) is seen in <1 percent of patients with MM. The LPL seen in the bone marrow of patients with WM can be distinguished from plasma cells seen in the bone marrow of patients with MM by the absence of CD56 and the presence of a substantial small lymphocytic component that expresses a clonal surface immunoglobulin, CD19, and CD20. Identification of the MYD88 L265P gene mutation helps differentiate WM from IgM MM as well, as it has been identified in over 90 percent of patients with WM and <5 percent of IgM MM [105].\n【155】 Some patients with MM and t(11;14) may have lymphoplasmacytic or small mature plasma cell morphology, along with CD20 expression that may resemble WM. However, the t(11;14) translocation is not seen in WM.\n【156】 Classic MM with an IgM paraprotein (IgM MM) is extremely rare, comprising only 0.5 percent of a Mayo Clinic series [9]. The Mayo Clinic criteria for diagnosis of IgM MM (and its differentiation from WM) require presence of lytic bone lesions felt secondary to the plasma cell disorder and/or evidence of the t(11;14) translocation [106]. The criteria are conservative and designed to emphasize specificity over sensitivity and ensure that patients with WM are not misclassified and treated as MM patients based on less reliable and subjective measures such as CD20 expression or morphology.\n【157】 To make the diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma, the following four criteria must be met:\n【158】 ●Biopsy-proven solitary lesion of the bone or soft tissue that demonstrates clonal plasma cells.\n【159】 ●Normal bone marrow with no evidence of clonal plasma cells.\n【160】 ●Cross-sectional imaging (eg, MRI, PET/CT) is normal except for the primary solitary lesion.\n【161】 ●Absence of lytic lesions, anemia, hypercalcemia, and kidney impairment.\n【162】 Note that patients who have a biopsy-proven solitary medullary or extramedullary lesion with a small percentage of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow are usually treated in a similar fashion to those with solitary plasmacytoma but technically are considered to have \"solitary plasmacytoma with minimal marrow involvement\" if clonal bone marrow plasma cells are <10 percent. Conversely, a patient with a plasmacytoma is considered to have MM (typically Durie-Salmon stage 1) if clonal bone marrow plasma cells are ≥10 percent. (See  \"Multiple myeloma: Staging and prognostic studies\".)\n【163】 In contrast to patients with MM, patients with AL amyloidosis usually demonstrate less than 20 percent bone marrow plasma cells, no lytic bone lesions on imaging, and a modest amount of Bence Jones proteinuria. The diagnosis of primary amyloidosis is established by demonstrating amyloid on a biopsy of affected tissue, such as abdominal fat, bone marrow, rectum, or kidney. (See  \"Monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease\" and  \"Clinical presentation, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis\".)\n【164】 Rarely, MM can develop in patients with primary amyloidosis. In a series of 1596 patients with primary amyloidosis seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1960 and 1994, only six (0.4 percent) showed delayed progression (at 10 to 81 months) to overt MM [107]. This usually occurs in patients without cardiac or hepatic amyloid who live long enough to develop MM. On the other hand, the development of dipstick-positive proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and edema or heart failure in a patient with known MM suggests superimposed amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease.\n【165】 Immunohistochemical staining of an affected tissue (eg, mass lesion, lymph node, bone marrow) shows a clonal population of cells staining positively for a heavy chain but negative for both kappa and lambda light chains.\n【166】 Polyneuropathy is uncommon as a presenting symptom in classical MM and, when present, is often due to the presence of coexisting AL amyloidosis. The presence of anemia, hypercalcemia, kidney failure, pathologic fractures, and a high percent of plasma cells in the bone marrow all serve to distinguish classical MM from POEMS syndrome.\n【167】 In rare instances, MM may be associated with the presence of diffuse and not focal osteosclerotic bone lesions. Such patients have the typical clinical and laboratory features of MM and do not have the other characteristics of POEMS syndrome.\n【168】 Similarly, for patients with lytic lesions in whom no M protein is found in the serum or urine, metastatic carcinoma should be excluded before the diagnosis of nonsecretory myeloma is seriously considered, by performing a biopsy of one of the lytic lesions (table 2).\n【169】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on \"patient education\" and the keyword(s) of interest.)\n【170】 ●Basics topics (see  \"Patient education: Multiple myeloma (The Basics)\" and  \"Patient education: Bone metastases (The Basics)\")\n【171】 ●Beyond the Basics topics (see  \"Patient education: Multiple myeloma symptoms, diagnosis, and staging (Beyond the Basics)\" and  \"Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)\")\n【172】 ●Clinical presentation – Multiple myeloma (MM) is typically characterized by the neoplastic proliferation of immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells. Most patients present with signs or symptoms related to the infiltration of plasma cells into the bone or other organs or to kidney damage from excess light chains. (See 'Clinical presentation' above.)\n【173】 Common presentations include anemia, bone pain, elevated creatinine or serum protein, fatigue, and hypercalcemia.\n【174】 Less common presentations that require urgent evaluation include spinal cord compression, acute kidney failure, severe hypercalcemia, and hyperviscosity.\n【175】 ●Evaluation of suspected cases – In patients with suspected MM or related disorders, initial testing includes a complete blood count, serum calcium and creatinine, serum protein electrophoresis along with immunofixation, serum free light chain (FLC) assay, and quantitative immunoglobulins. (See 'Evaluation' above.)\n【176】 Further studies are dependent upon these results (algorithm 1). Evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of MM includes a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging, urinalysis, and a 24-hour urine collection for electrophoresis and immunofixation. This 24-hour urine collection at the time diagnosis is important to establish a baseline M protein level and to evaluate for nephrotic range proteinuria, a finding that may be due to coexisting light chain deposition disease or AL amyloidosis.\n【177】 Bone marrow infiltration with malignant plasma cells may be focal, requiring aspiration/biopsy at multiple sites. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or positron emission tomography (PET) can be helpful in locating focal disease. (See 'Imaging' above.)\n【178】 ●Diagnostic criteria – The diagnosis of MM requires (table 3) (see 'Diagnostic criteria' above):\n【179】 ●Differential diagnosis – The main conditions to consider in the differential diagnosis for MM include monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, solitary plasmacytoma, AL amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome, and metastatic carcinoma (table 6 and table 4).

Common clinical features include facial erythema, telangiectasias, and inflammatory papules or pustules. Many patients seek therapy due to concern over the effect of rosacea on physical appearance. As there is no cure for rosacea, treatment is focused on symptom suppression.\n【2】 The management of rosacea will be discussed here. The pathogenesis and clinical features of rosacea are reviewed separately. (See  \"Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis\".)\n【3】 PATIENT ASSESSMENT — Rosacea can manifest with a wide variety of cutaneous features. Examples include persistent centrofacial redness, phymatous skin changes (eg, rhinophyma), papules, pustules, flushing, telangiectases, burning or stinging sensations, edema, and skin dryness (picture 1A-E). Ocular involvement may also occur, manifesting with lid margin telangiectases, conjunctival injection, ocular irritation, or other signs and symptoms. (See  \"Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical features'.)\n【4】 The classification of rosacea has evolved from a division into distinct subtypes (erythematotelangiectatic rosacea, papulopustular rosacea, phymatous rosacea, and ocular rosacea) to a phenotype-based approach that views the various features of rosacea as manifestations of a continuous multivariate disease process. The approach to treatment is guided by the clinical features present in an individual patient. Given the common presence of multiple features, combination therapy may be necessary to achieve satisfactory control of disease [1,2]. (See 'Facial redness, flushing, skin sensitivity, and skin dryness' below and 'Papules and pustules' below and 'Ocular manifestations' below and 'Phymatous skin changes' below and  \"Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Classification'.)\n【5】 GENERAL MEASURES — Nonpharmacologic interventions may be useful for the management of the cutaneous manifestations of rosacea. These include avoidance of triggers of flushing, gentle skin care, sun-protection, and the use of cosmetic products.\n【6】 Avoidance of flushing — Easy flushing is a common feature of rosacea. Flushing is a prominent and troubling symptom for some patients, and some authors have proposed that flushing may contribute to worsening of other features of rosacea, such as inflammatory papules, erythema, and skin sensitivity [3-5].\n【7】 Potential triggers for flushing include [4,6-8]:\n【8】 Individual patients may also have unique triggers for flushing, and the degree of flushing in response to the above stimuli is variable. Thus, asking patients to keep a diary of flushing episodes and potential associated factors can be useful for identifying and avoiding pertinent triggers. In addition, practical measures to reduce flushing after encounters with stimuli, such as applying cool compresses and transferring to cool environments, may be helpful.\n【9】 A variety of pharmacologic agents, including clonidine, beta-blockers, antidepressants, gabapentin, and topical oxymetazoline have been used in attempts to reduce flushing [9-16]. However, data are limited on their efficacy in rosacea and no single therapy appears to be consistently effective. Moreover, the potential for drug-related adverse effects must be considered. (See  \"Approach to flushing in adults\", section on 'Treatment'.)\n【10】 Laser, intense pulsed light, and photodynamic therapy also have been used for patients with rosacea-related flushing, but data are limited on treatment effects [17-20].\n【11】 Skin care — Patients with rosacea, particularly those with centrofacial erythema and telangiectases, can experience heightened sensitivity of facial skin characterized by difficulty tolerating topical cosmetics, skin care products, and topical medications [21]. In addition, rough, dry, or scaly facial skin is a common feature.\n【12】 It is unclear whether subjective skin sensitivity and dryness result from abnormalities in skin barrier function that precede the development of rosacea, or whether they occur as a consequence of the inflammatory process [22]. Regardless, gentle skin care practices may help to reduce symptoms. Appropriate measures include:\n【13】 Sun protection — The role of sun exposure in the pathogenesis of rosacea is uncertain. Flares of facial redness and flushing may be stimulated by exposure to radiant heat from the sun, and ultraviolet radiation may induce cutaneous changes that promote rosacea.\n【14】 We routinely recommend daily application of a broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 and educate patients on mid-day sun avoidance and the use of sun-protective clothing. Sunscreens in the form of creams, lotions, or preparations that contain barrier protective silicones (eg, dimethicone or cyclomethicone) are preferred over those in an alcohol-based vehicle, which may be more likely to cause irritation [27,28].\n【15】 Cosmetic camouflage — For patients who are bothered by facial erythema or telangiectasias, green-tinted foundation can help to camouflage these features. A flesh-colored facial foundation should be applied on top of the green-tinted foundation to achieve a color that matches the patient's complexion [29]. Light application of a green-tinted cosmetic facial powder can also be useful for camouflaging facial redness.\n【16】 FACIAL REDNESS, FLUSHING, SKIN SENSITIVITY, AND SKIN DRYNESS\n【17】 Approach to treatment — Nonpharmacologic measures may assist with reducing facial redness, flushing, skin sensitivity, and skin dryness, and are sufficient for the management of some patients with mild symptoms. When satisfactory improvement cannot be attained with these interventions, treatment with lasers, intense pulsed light, or pharmacologic agents is an option. The treatment of flushing is challenging; the management of this feature is discussed in greater detail elsewhere. (See 'Avoidance of flushing' above and  \"Approach to flushing in adults\", section on 'Treatment'.)\n【18】 First-line interventions — Behavioral changes can be beneficial. We educate all patients on the avoidance of triggers of flushing, proper use of sun protection, and gentle skin care [3,27]. (See 'General measures' above.)\n【19】 Second-line interventions — Patients who fail to improve adequately with behavioral interventions and who desire additional treatment may benefit from medical intervention. Options include light-based modalities and pharmacologic agents.\n【20】 Laser and intense pulsed light — Laser and light-based therapies, which have been used extensively for the treatment of a variety of vascular lesions, have also been used for the vascular features of rosacea, especially telangiectasias. During treatment, light energy is absorbed by hemoglobin in cutaneous vessels, leading to vessel heating and coagulation. (See  \"Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions\", section on 'Principles of laser therapy'.)\n【21】 Vascular lesions are commonly treated with lasers that emit green or yellow light (eg, pulsed dye or potassium titanyl phosphate [KTP] lasers) due to the relatively high absorption of light in these ranges by hemoglobin (figure 1 and table 1). Intense pulsed light devices, which are also frequently used for this indication, are lower energy light sources that emit noncoherent light in a broad range of wavelengths. (See  \"Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions\", section on 'Types of vascular lasers'.)\n【22】 Improvement in both facial erythema and telangiectasias can occur after treatment with pulsed dye lasers, KTP lasers, or intense pulsed light [17,30-43]. Most data on the efficacy of these modalities are derived from small, randomized controlled trials and uncontrolled studies. One split-face, randomized trial compared treatment with a pulsed dye laser with nonpurpuragenic settings to intense pulsed light and no treatment in 29 patients with rosacea. The two therapies were similarly beneficial for facial erythema and telangiectasias [43]. (See  \"Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions\", section on 'Telangiectasias and the red face'.)\n【23】 Near infrared lasers can be used to treat large, deep telangiectasias but are associated with increased risk for adverse effects (table 1). Improvement in other clinical features, such as flushing, skin sensitivity, and skin texture, have also been reported in patients treated with laser or intense pulsed light therapy [17,19,44].\n【24】 Light-based modalities do not cure rosacea, and periodic treatments to maintain improvement are often required. Potential adverse effects of laser and intense pulsed light therapy include skin dyspigmentation, blistering, ulceration, and scarring.\n【25】 Pharmacologic therapy — The pharmacologic agent with the strongest evidence for efficacy for persistent facial erythema in rosacea is topical brimonidine [45]. Data from studies in patients with papulopustular rosacea suggest that medications primarily used for papulopustular disease (eg, topical antimicrobials, azelaic acid, and oral antibiotics) may also have benefit for the reduction of rosacea-associated facial erythema [46-54]. However, no high-quality randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of these therapies in patients without papules and pustules. In our experience, satisfactory improvement in persistent facial erythema with medications used for papulopustular disease is uncommon. Telangiectasias are particularly unlikely to improve with medications and are best managed with light-based treatments. (See 'Laser and intense pulsed light' above.)\n【26】 Topical brimonidine — Brimonidine tartrate, a vasoconstrictive alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of open angle glaucoma, has emerged as a treatment for rosacea-associated facial erythema [45]. The efficacy of this agent when applied topically is supported by the results of phase II and phase III randomized trials [55,56]. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved brimonidine 0.33% gel for the treatment of persistent (nontransient) facial erythema of rosacea based upon the findings of two 29-day placebo-controlled randomized trials conducted in a total of 553 adults with moderate to severe persistent facial erythema of rosacea [57]. At the end of the study, at least two-grade reductions in both clinician and patient assessment scales were achieved three hours after application by 31 and 25 percent of patients treated with brimonidine 0.33% gel versus only 11 and 9 percent of patients treated with vehicle. The efficacy of topical brimonidine has not been directly compared with laser or intense pulsed light therapy.\n【27】 Topical brimonidine 0.33% gel appears to be well tolerated [57,58]. An open-label study in which women applied a 0.5% formulation of brimonidine tartrate gel supports the potential for continued safety and efficacy of topical brimonidine over one year of treatment [59]. The most common adverse effects are erythema, flushing, skin burning sensation, and contact dermatitis. The occurrence of severe, transient rebound erythema several hours after application has been reported [60,61]. An occurrence of persistent erythema in skin adjacent to the site of long-term brimonidine application also has been reported [62]. The true incidence of worsening erythema is not known but has been estimated to be up to 20 percent [63]. Patients should be counseled about these side effects prior to therapy.\n【28】 The effect of brimonidine on papulopustular lesions of rosacea has not been specifically studied. Topical brimonidine has not appeared to aggravate papulopustular lesions of rosacea in randomized trials evaluating its efficacy for facial erythema [55,56]. Our experience suggests that brimonidine is not effective for the treatment of papulopustular lesions. Use in conjunction with other therapies may be beneficial for patients with both erythema and papulopustular lesions [64]. (See 'Papules and pustules' below.)\n【29】 Topical oxymetazoline — Oxymetazoline, an alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist used for the treatment of nasal congestion, may have modest efficacy for facial erythema in rosacea [45].\n【30】 The 2017 FDA approval of oxymetazoline 1% cream for reducing persistent facial erythema associated with rosacea in adults was based upon two randomized trials in which a total of 885 adults with rosacea applied either oxymetazoline or vehicle once daily for 29 days [65,66]. More patients in the oxymetazoline groups achieved the primary efficacy endpoint (at least a two-grade reduction in erythema from baseline on both a five-point clinician erythema assessment scale and a five-point patient self-assessment scale at 3, 6, 9, and 12 hours after application) than in the vehicle groups. On day 29 in the first trial, 12 and 6 percent of patients receiving oxymetazoline and vehicle, respectively, achieved this endpoint three hours after application. In the second trial, this was achieved at the same time point by 14 and 7 percent of patients in the oxymetazoline and vehicle groups, respectively. Potential side effects of oxymetazoline include application site dermatitis, worsening of inflammatory rosacea lesions, pain, pruritus, and erythema.\n【31】 A 52-week, open-label study (REVEAL study) of 440 patients treated with oxymetazoline for moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea supports long-term efficacy and tolerability [67]. In this study, less than 1 percent of patients experienced post-treatment rebound erythema; however, data from postmarketing surveillance is pending. The REVEAL study also demonstrated increased chance of meaningful treatment response with prolonged use, thus suggesting that best clinical results may come from daily, long-term, continued use of oxymetazoline [68].\n【32】 Additional safety considerations — Because of concern for risk for potentiation of vascular insufficiency and hypotension during treatment with alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, cautious use is recommended in patients with depression, cerebral or coronary insufficiency, Raynaud's phenomenon, orthostatic hypotension, thromboangiitis obliterans, scleroderma, Sjögren syndrome, and severe cardiovascular disease. Caution is also recommended for patients who are receiving treatment with antihypertensives, cardiac glycosides, central nervous system depressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Ingestion of brimonidine may result in serious adverse effects and should be avoided.\n【33】 Other interventions — Additional studies are required to determine the value of topical retinoids [69,70], licochalcone A (an ingredient derived from the licorice plant) [71], oral isotretinoin [27], oral apremilast [72], topical tranexamic acid [73], dual-frequency ultrasound [74], microfocused ultrasound [75], and botulinum toxin injections in the treatment of facial redness and skin sensitivity in rosacea. The role of topical calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) in this presentation of rosacea is uncertain. Improvement with topical tacrolimus has been reported in small numbers of patients [76,77].\n【34】 PAPULES AND PUSTULES — Rosacea can present with inflammatory papules and/or pustules primarily distributed on the central face. Patients often also exhibit persistent facial erythema, frequent flushing, and telangiectasias.\n【35】 Approach to treatment — Most patients with mild to moderate disease (picture 1C, 1F) can be managed with topical therapies such as metronidazole, azelaic acid, topical ivermectin, or sulfacetamide-sulfur. Systemic agents are typically used in patients who fail to respond satisfactorily to topical agents or who present with numerous inflammatory lesions (picture 1D). Tetracycline-class antibiotics are first-line systemic agents for papules and pustules of rosacea; for patients who fail to respond to tetracyclines or who cannot tolerate these drugs, treatment with other oral antibiotics is an option. Laser therapy, intense pulsed light, and photodynamic therapy have also been used, but the efficacy of these therapies remains uncertain.\n【36】 Mild to moderate disease — Topical metronidazole, azelaic acid, and topical ivermectin are considered first-line therapies in mild to moderate disease (picture 1F-G) due to evidence from randomized trials in support of their efficacy and the relative safety of these medications. A systematic review found high-quality evidence to support the efficacy of these drugs [78]. Other agents, such as sulfacetamide-sulfur, also may be beneficial.\n【37】 Topical metronidazole — The mechanism through which metronidazole improves rosacea is unknown, but may involve antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, or antioxidant properties [79]. Topical metronidazole is most effective for the treatment of inflammatory papules and pustules, but may also contribute to improvement in facial erythema.\n【38】 A systematic review of randomized trials performed primarily in patients with papulopustular features of rosacea found moderate certainty evidence in support of the use of topical metronidazole [45]. Metronidazole was superior to placebo (relative risk [RR] 1.98; 95% CI 1.29-3.02).\n【39】 Topical metronidazole is available as a 0.75% cream or gel, a 1% cream or gel, and a 0.75% lotion. Unlike 1% formulations, which are labeled for once-daily application, drug labels for 0.75% formulations recommend twice daily use. However, the product concentration, frequency of application, and vehicle (cream, gel, or lotion) may not significantly affect treatment efficacy:\n【40】 The data above suggest that once daily application of 0.75% metronidazole may be sufficient, but additional studies are necessary. The drug vehicle should be selected based upon patient preference and tolerability.\n【41】 Improvement in inflammatory lesions may occur after as few as two to four weeks of therapy, but full results are typically observed after eight to nine weeks of treatment [82-85]. Relapses often occur when metronidazole is discontinued; thus, long-term therapy is usually needed [86].\n【42】 Topical metronidazole is generally well tolerated; the most common adverse effects are local irritation, dryness, and stinging sensations [84].\n【43】 Topical azelaic acid — Azelaic acid is a naturally occurring dicarboxylic acid with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. Similar to metronidazole, azelaic acid improves papular and pustular lesions, and may also reduce erythema. The mechanism of action for azelaic acid in rosacea is not well understood. Reductions in messenger RNA for cathelicidin and kallikrein 5, potential contributors to the development of rosacea, have been detected following treatment with topical azelaic acid in patients with rosacea [87]. Azelaic acid-induced modulation of the inflammatory response via activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma is an additional potential mechanism of action [88]. (See  \"Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Immune dysfunction'.)\n【44】 The utility of azelaic acid for rosacea is supported by a systematic review of randomized trials performed primarily in patients with papulopustular rosacea that found high certainty evidence to support this therapy. Azelaic acid was a more effective treatment than placebo (RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.28-1.53) [45]. Examples of trials demonstrating efficacy of this agent include:\n【45】 Initial improvement from azelaic acid may be noted within the first few weeks of use. Better results are typically observed after 12 to 15 weeks of therapy [85].\n【46】 Although package inserts for azelaic acid recommend twice daily application, a randomized trial in 72 patients treated with the 15% gel failed to identify a difference in efficacy between once daily and twice daily dosing, suggesting that once daily application may be sufficient for improvement [91]. Rates of adverse effects and treatment tolerability were similar in the two groups.\n【47】 The most frequent side effect of azelaic acid is skin discomfort after application [90,92,93]. In two randomized trials in which a total of 333 patients were treated with azelaic acid 15% gel, 38 percent of patients reported burning, itching, or stinging sensations [47]. Symptoms were transient and mild to moderate in the majority of patients, and less than 1 percent of all patients had severe, persistent sensory symptoms.\n【48】 Azelaic acid versus metronidazole — Azelaic acid appears to be at least equally as effective as metronidazole for the treatment of papules and pustules in rosacea, and some trials have demonstrated superior efficacy [45]:\n【49】 Topical ivermectin — Ivermectin is an agent with both anti-inflammatory and antiparasitic properties. The drug is commercially available for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea as a 1% cream. Ivermectin 1% cream is applied once daily. A pea-sized amount is applied to each affected area of the face (eg, forehead, chin, nose, each cheek) and spread into a thin layer [96].\n【50】 Use of topical ivermectin 1% cream for papular and pustular lesions of rosacea is supported by two high-quality, vehicle-controlled, randomized trials that demonstrated efficacy in adults with moderate to severe rosacea (defined in the study as 15 to 70 inflammatory papules or pustules) [45,97]. In the first trial, 173 of 451 patients (38 percent) treated with ivermectin were clear or almost clear of inflammatory lesions after 12 weeks. In contrast, this endpoint was achieved by only 27 of 232 patients (12 percent) in the vehicle group. The results of the second trial were similar; after 12 weeks, 184 of 459 patients (40 percent) treated with ivermectin versus 43 of 229 patients (19 percent) given vehicle were clear or almost clear of inflammatory lesions.\n【51】 Treatment with ivermectin cream is well tolerated. A long-term safety study found use of topical ivermectin 1% cream safe and effective for up to 52 weeks [98].\n【52】 The efficacy of topical ivermectin may be related to anti-Demodex and anti-inflammatory activity. Of note, patients in the randomized trials were not evaluated for Demodex infestation prior to therapy. A retrospective study of 50 patients with rosacea papules and pustules treated with topical ivermectin once daily found both a reduction in Demodex mites and clinical improvement after 16 weeks of treatment [99].\n【53】 Ivermectin versus metronidazole — A 16-week randomized trial that compared once-daily use of ivermectin 1% cream with twice-daily use of metronidazole 0.75% cream in 962 adults with moderate to severe rosacea presenting with papules, pustules, and erythema found that topical ivermectin was more effective for reducing inflammatory lesions [100]. Moreover, a 36-week extension phase of this study revealed longer remissions after treatment with topical ivermectin than after treatment with topical metronidazole (115 versus 85 days) [101].\n【54】 Choice of treatment — Based upon these observations, topical ivermectin, metronidazole, and azelaic acid are reasonable choices for first-line topical therapy for papules and pustules in rosacea. The lower cost of metronidazole 0.75% gel (the least expensive formulation of metronidazole) compared with azelaic acid and ivermectin favors the initial use of metronidazole. We also favor metronidazole or ivermectin in patients who present with significant facial sensitivity, due to the fairly frequent occurrence of irritation early in the course of therapy with azelaic acid [90,92,93,98]. (See 'Topical azelaic acid' above.)\n【55】 Alternative topical agents — Topical minocycline has emerged as an additional treatment option for papulopustular manifestations of rosacea based upon data from randomized trials. Less well-studied topical agents used for the management of rosacea include topical sulfacetamide-sulfur, benzoyl peroxide, erythromycin, clindamycin, topical retinoids, and permethrin. We generally utilize these agents in patients who cannot tolerate or obtain metronidazole, ivermectin, or azelaic acid or who fail to respond to those therapies but prefer to avoid oral agents.\n【56】 Topical minocycline — Topical minocycline 1.5% foam is applied once daily to affected areas.\n【57】 Two identical, 12-week, phase 3, randomized trials (n = 751 and n = 771) support the efficacy of topical minocycline for papulopustular manifestations of rosacea [102]. In the trials, adults with moderate to severe papulopustular rosacea were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to once-daily application of either minocycline 1.5% foam or vehicle foam to the entire face. Greater reductions in inflammatory lesion counts at week 12 occurred in the minocycline groups in both trials. Similarly, more patients in the minocycline groups achieved treatment success (defined as at least a two-grade improvement on the five-point Investigator's Global Assessment scale).\n【58】 Treatment with topical minocycline was generally well tolerated. No serious adverse events occurred. Minocycline-induced skin dyspigmentation, a potential adverse effect of oral minocycline, was not reported. An open-label, extension study of the aforementioned trials of minocycline foam did not demonstrate any dyspigmentation in subjects using minocycline foam up to 52 weeks [103].\n【59】 Sulfacetamide-sulfur — Sulfacetamide-sulfur is available in a variety of formulations, including topical suspensions, lotions, cleansers, creams, foams, and cleansing pads. The most common concentration is sulfacetamide 10% with sulfur 5%. Other drug concentrations and formulations with added sunscreen or cosmetically-beneficial green coloring are also available (see 'Cosmetic camouflage' above). The mechanism of action of sulfacetamide-sulfur in rosacea is unknown.\n【60】 In comparison to metronidazole and azelaic acid, data on the efficacy of sulfacetamide-sulfur are limited. A vehicle-controlled randomized trial in 103 patients and an open-label study in 59 patients reported benefit of this agent for inflammatory lesions and erythema [104,105]. Additional studies are necessary to confirm the results of a 12-week randomized trial of 152 patients that found that a sulfacetamide 10%-sulfur 5% cream containing sunscreen was superior to metronidazole 0.75% cream for the reduction of pustular, but not papular, lesions [106].\n【61】 Side effects of sulfacetamide-sulfur include local irritation and allergic reactions [27,104]. Use of sulfacetamide-sulfur should be avoided in patients with sulfonamide (\"sulfa\") allergies [27]. Of note, some patients find the odor of sulfacetamide-sulfur agents unfavorable.\n【62】 Other therapies\n【63】 Topical calcineurin inhibitors do not appear to be beneficial for papulopustular rosacea. Small placebo controlled randomized trials failed to find statistically superior efficacy for pimecrolimus 1% cream [111,112], and tacrolimus 0.1% ointment was not effective for papulopustular lesions in a small uncontrolled study [77]. In addition, the development of rosacea-like cutaneous eruptions has been reported in patients treated with topical tacrolimus for other indications [113].\n【64】 Moderate to severe disease — Patients who present with numerous inflammatory papules or pustules (picture 1D), or those with milder disease that fails to respond to one or more topical therapies may benefit from oral antibiotic therapy. Of the oral antibiotics, tetracyclines are the best-studied agents.\n【65】 Oral tetracyclines — Tetracycline, doxycycline, and minocycline have been used for many years for the management of rosacea. These agents are most useful for improving inflammatory papules and pustules, and may also reduce erythema [51,53].\n【66】 Since no definitive microbial cause of rosacea has been identified, the efficacy of oral antibiotics in rosacea is often attributed to their anti-inflammatory properties [114]. Tetracyclines may decrease levels of proinflammatory cathelicidins (components of the innate immune system) through inhibition of serine proteases, may reduce levels of proinflammatory cytokines, and may have matrix-protecting capabilities [114,115]. (See  \"Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Immune dysfunction'.)\n【67】 Efficacy and administration — Traditional, antimicrobial doses for tetracycline are 250 to 1000 mg per day and 100 to 200 mg per day for doxycycline and minocycline [116,117]. Few placebo-controlled randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of these doses in rosacea. In two early, small trials, tetracycline (250 mg twice daily for four to eight weeks or 750 mg per day for one week followed by 250 mg to 500 mg per day for five weeks) was associated with improvement in inflammatory lesions [51,118]. In addition, randomized trials comparing doxycycline with other oral antibiotics found that a 100 mg per day dose of doxycycline effectively improves papulopustular rosacea [54,119]. (See 'Alternative oral antibiotics' below.)\n【68】 Due to concern for the development of antibiotic resistance, interest has grown in the use of subantimicrobial doses of antibiotics, which retain anti-inflammatory properties but lack antibacterial effects. Support for the efficacy of subantimicrobial doses of doxycycline (20 mg taken twice daily or a combination pill containing 30 mg of immediate release doxycycline and 10 mg of delayed release doxycycline taken once daily) come from both randomized trials [120,121] and an open label study of almost 1200 patients [53]. In two 16-week placebo-controlled randomized trials performed in 537 patients with 10 to 40 inflammatory lesions, doxycycline was associated with significantly greater reductions in inflammatory lesion counts [120]. In addition, one of the two trials and the open-label study found improvement in erythema [53].\n【69】 Few randomized trials have compared subantimicrobial dose doxycycline with higher doses of oral tetracyclines. One randomized trial with 91 patients compared subantimicrobial dose doxycycline (40 mg once daily) with doxycycline 100 mg per day [122]. Both doses were similarly effective for the treatment of inflammatory lesions, but the lower dose was associated with a reduced rate of gastrointestinal side effects (5 versus 26 percent). In addition, a 16-week trial that compared doxycycline (40 mg once daily) with minocycline (100 mg once daily) found similar reductions in lesion counts in both groups [123].\n【70】 We typically initiate treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily, minocycline 100 mg twice daily, or tetracycline 500 mg twice daily and continue treatment for 4 to 12 weeks in an attempt to quickly decrease inflammation. Initiating treatment with subantimicrobial dose doxycycline is another reasonable option. We generally favor doxycycline over minocycline for initial treatment because of minocycline's broader side effect profile.\n【71】 After satisfactory improvement is attained with the initial course of therapy, we transition patients to a topical agent, most often metronidazole or azelaic acid (see 'Topical metronidazole' above and 'Topical azelaic acid' above). Continuing oral therapy at the lowest effective dose is another option in patients who fail to maintain improvement or who are unable to tolerate topical therapy [3]. Subantimicrobial dose doxycycline is our preferred choice for long-term oral therapy.\n【72】 Patients who respond well to topical maintenance therapy may have occasional \"break-through\" flares of papulopustular lesions spaced by several months or more. For such patients, we have found the administration of an abbreviated course of an oral antibiotic (eg, doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10 days) useful for quieting the acute flares, circumventing the need for long-term oral therapy. These patients are continued on topical maintenance therapy during and after oral treatment.\n【73】 Adverse effects of oral tetracyclines include gastrointestinal distress and photosensitivity. Minocycline is the least photosensitizing of these agents, but it may cause vertigo, a lupus-like syndrome, and skin discoloration. Tetracyclines should not be given to children under the age of nine due to a risk for permanent tooth discoloration and reduced bone growth.\n【74】 Combined with topical agents — Adding an oral antibiotic to topical therapy may improve treatment results. Two randomized trials that compared treatment with topical metronidazole alone to topical metronidazole plus subantimicrobial dose doxycycline found superior improvement in inflammatory lesions with combination therapy [121,124]. In an investigator-blinded, 12-week, randomized trial (n = 273), the combination of 40 mg per day of doxycycline and daily application of ivermectin 1% cream was associated with greater efficacy and faster improvement in papulopustular manifestations of severe rosacea compared with monotherapy with ivermectin 1% cream [125].\n【75】 Alternative oral antibiotics — Other oral antibiotics are less frequently used for the treatment of rosacea, but may also be effective. These include macrolides (clarithromycin, azithromycin, and erythromycin) and oral metronidazole [27,52,54,119].\n【76】 An eight-week randomized trial comparing clarithromycin (250 mg twice daily for four weeks followed by 250 mg daily for four weeks) with doxycycline (100 mg twice daily for four weeks followed by 100 mg once daily for four weeks) found significantly greater improvement in objective measures of inflammatory lesions, erythema, and telangiectasias in patients treated with clarithromycin at early study time points, but differences among the two groups dissipated by week eight [54]. A separate 12-week trial that compared azithromycin (500 mg three times per week followed by a taper) with doxycycline 100 mg daily found that the drugs were similarly effective [119].\n【77】 Oral metronidazole is commonly used for the treatment of rosacea in Europe. In a randomized trial of 40 patients that compared treatment with metronidazole (200 mg twice daily) to oxytetracycline (250 mg twice daily), the agents appeared to be similarly effective [126]. Alcohol should be avoided during treatment with metronidazole due to the possibility of the induction of a disulfiram-like reaction.\n【78】 Refractory disease\n【79】 Oral isotretinoin — Patients who fail to respond to topical therapies and oral antibiotics may improve with oral isotretinoin [69,127-129]. Oral isotretinoin is not used as first-line therapy due to the drug's many adverse effects, including teratogenicity. In the United States, oral isotretinoin can only be prescribed through the iPLEDGE program, an internet-based risk management program. (See  \"Oral isotretinoin therapy for acne vulgaris\", section on 'Teratogenicity' and  \"Oral isotretinoin therapy for acne vulgaris\", section on 'Adverse effects'.)\n【80】 Although improvement in inflammatory lesions and facial erythema has been reported in several randomized trials and observational studies [69,127-129], high-quality data on the efficacy of isotretinoin for rosacea are scarce, and the ideal regimen for treatment has not been established. Doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day have been utilized in some patients, but lower doses may be effective and better-tolerated.\n【81】 The authors of a 12-week dose-comparison randomized trial reported a 90 percent reduction of inflammatory lesions in patients treated with 0.3 mg/kg per day [129]. Additionally, compared with patients who were treated with 0.5 mg/kg/day, these patients had a lower incidence of drug-related facial dermatitis.\n【82】 In another randomized trial, 156 patients with papulopustular rosacea that had failed to respond to three or more previous treatments were treated with low-dose isotretinoin (0.25 mg/kg) or placebo daily for four months [130]. The primary endpoint was a reduction in the lesion number of at least 90 percent. At the end of the study, more patients in the isotretinoin group than those in the placebo group reached the primary endpoint (57 versus 10 percent, absolute difference 47 percent, 95% CI 34 to 60 percent; number needed to treat 2). Adverse effects, including cheilitis, dry skin, and abdominal pain, were more common in the isotretinoin group than in the placebo group (69 versus 44 percent). Patients were followed for 4 months after isotretinoin completion. Rosacea relapsed in 53 percent of patients who responded to isotretinoin after a median time of 15 weeks.\n【83】 We typically treat patients with around 0.2 mg/kg per day (usually a total of 10 to 20 mg per day) until the inflammatory component is consistently well controlled for one to two months. In our experience, this usually occurs after five to six months of therapy.\n【84】 The longevity of treatment effect varies; in a series of 20 patients with severe rosacea treated with isotretinoin doses of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day for three to six months, remissions lasting at least one year were reported in 17 patients [131]. Of note, five out of six patients initially treated with 1 mg/kg per day required dose reductions due to adverse effects. The remission period may be shorter in patients treated with low-doses [130].\n【85】 After completion of a successful course of isotretinoin, we routinely initiate maintenance therapy with topical metronidazole, azelaic acid, or other standard therapies for pustular rosacea in an attempt to increase the likelihood of sustained remission. However, the efficacy of this approach has not been studied.\n【86】 Laser and intense pulsed light — Treatment with light-based therapies has yielded variable results in patients with papules and pustules. Although the results of two uncontrolled studies utilizing intense pulsed light or pulsed dye laser suggest that some improvement in inflammatory papules is possible [132,133], other studies have found conflicting results [35,134,135], and there is insufficient evidence to conclude that improvement is long-lasting.\n【87】 Photodynamic therapy, which involves the application of a photosensitizing agent (aminolevulinic acid or methyl aminolevulinic acid) to skin and exposure of the treatment site to a light source, has also yielded mixed results. Improvement in inflammatory lesions lasting three months or longer was reported in a small retrospective study and two out of four patients in a case series [136,137]; however, in another case series, disease severity returned to baseline in three out of four patients within 12 weeks after treatment [134].\n【88】 Maintenance therapy — Because rosacea is a chronic disorder and treatments are not curative, continued therapy is typically necessary to maintain treatment response. Most commonly, long-term topical therapy is administered. Subantimicrobial doses of doxycycline are also an option. (See 'Oral tetracyclines' above.)\n【89】 OCULAR MANIFESTATIONS — Ocular involvement may occur in the presence or absence of cutaneous manifestations. Examples of features of ocular rosacea include foreign body sensations, blepharitis, lid margin telangiectasia, tear abnormalities, meibomian gland inflammation, frequent chalazion, conjunctivitis, and rarely, corneal ulcers and vascularization [138]. Patients who present with signs or symptoms of ocular involvement should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation. (See  \"Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical features'.)\n【90】 Lid scrubs and warm compresses may help improve meibomian gland function [139], and topical antibiotics such as topical erythromycin and metronidazole may quell mild lid inflammation [138,140,141]. For those with moderate to severe ocular rosacea, short courses of oral tetracycline-class antibiotics, macrolide antibiotics, or metronidazole are often needed [140,142,143]. Topical cyclosporine may also minimize inflammation [144].\n【91】 PHYMATOUS SKIN CHANGES — Tissue hypertrophy, dilated follicles, and irregular nodular overgrowths are characteristic features of the phymatous skin changes of rosacea. These changes most commonly affect the nose (rhinophyma), but may also affect other areas such as the chin, cheeks, and ears (picture 1E) [7,145]. Features of other subtypes of rosacea may also be present. (See  \"Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical features'.)\n【92】 Early disease — The best approach to the treatment of early phymatous skin changes is unknown. Improvements in phymatous changes have been reported in patients treated with 0.3 to 1 mg/kg per day of isotretinoin administered for periods of 12 to 28 weeks [129,146]. The duration of benefit is uncertain.\n【93】 Advanced disease — Laser ablation and surgical techniques can be used to debulk and recontour tissue distorted by phymatous changes. Ablative carbon dioxide lasers [147] and infrared diode lasers [148,149] have been used for this purpose. Surgical debulking can be performed through dermabrasion, scalpel excision, electrosurgery, or cryosurgery [150,151].\n【94】 The potential side effects of laser and surgical interventions include hypopigmentation, scarring, and pain. The risk for pigmentary changes rises with increasing skin pigmentation.\n【95】 SPECIAL CASES\n【96】 Granulomatous rosacea — Granulomatous rosacea may be a variant of rosacea. It presents with uniform red-brown or yellow-brown papules on the face. Other manifestations of rosacea may or may not be present [152-154]. (See  \"Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Granulomatous rosacea'.)\n【97】 Efficacy data on treatment for granulomatous rosacea are limited to case reports. Treatments are similar to those used for papulopustular rosacea. However, lesions may be slower to respond or less-likely to respond to therapy [155,156], and oral antibiotic therapy is often required [156,157]. Successful treatment with oral isotretinoin, oral dapsone, topical pimecrolimus, and intense pulsed light has also been documented [158-162].\n【98】 Pediatric rosacea — Infrequently, rosacea develops in children. All features, except for phymatous changes, may occur. (See  \"Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Epidemiology'.)\n【99】 As with adults, nonpharmacologic measures aimed at reducing symptoms are recommended. Mild to moderate papulopustular disease is usually managed with topical agents, such as metronidazole, azelaic acid, sulfacetamide-sulfur, and erythromycin (see 'Mild to moderate disease' above). Oral antibiotics may be necessary for patients with more severe papulopustular eruptions. Because tetracyclines are contraindicated in children under the age of nine, oral erythromycin (30 to 50 mg/kg/day), azithromycin, or clarithromycin may be substituted as a first-line oral agent [155,163]. Oral metronidazole (20 to 30 mg/kg per day) has also been used in the treatment of children [164]. As in adults, after oral antibiotics produce a remission, treatment with a topical agent may be used to maintain clearance.\n【100】 Ocular manifestations of rosacea are managed similarly as in adults, with the exclusion of tetracycline antibiotic therapy in children under the age of nine. Systemic antibiotics may be required for several months to achieve complete remission [165]. Granulomatous rosacea in the pediatric population may respond to topical or oral antibiotics [155,164]. Several months of treatment may be required for improvement.\n【101】 Pyoderma faciale — Pyoderma faciale (also known as rosacea fulminans) is an unusual eruption that is not officially recognized as a rosacea variant. The disorder is characterized by an abrupt onset of papules and suppurative nodules on the face [166]. Young women are most commonly affected [167]. (See  \"Rosacea: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Pyoderma faciale (rosacea fulminans)'.)\n【102】 Data on the treatment of pyoderma faciale are limited to reports of clinical experience. Patients can be managed with a combination of prednisone and oral isotretinoin. Prednisone is often started at 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day and tapered over a period of weeks, and isotretinoin is initiated around two weeks after the start of prednisone therapy with low doses of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/kg per day [163,167,168]. During the steroid taper, the isotretinoin dose is slowly increased to 0.5 to 1 mg/kg per day as tolerated. Some authors advocate treating until a cumulative dose of 150 mg/kg has been attained [168]; others believe that isotretinoin can be discontinued once inflammatory lesions have resolved [167]. We typically treat until a cumulative dose of 120 to 150 mg/kg has been attained, provided treatment is tolerated.\n【103】 Alternatives to the above regimen include initiation of doxycycline, minocycline, or tetracycline along with a prednisone taper as above [167,169]. Successful treatment with dapsone has also been reported [170].\n【104】 SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
