See manufacturer's labeling.\n【110】 Depot formulations: Vehicle used in injectable (polylactide-co-glycolide microspheres) has rarely been associated with retinal artery occlusion in patients with abnormal arteriovenous anastomosis (eg, patent foramen ovale) (Tang 2007). Do not use a fractional dose of the 3-, 4-, or 6-month depot formulation, or a combination of doses of the monthly depot formulation or any depot formulation due to different release characteristics. The Atrigel delivery system (used in Eligard/Fensolvi) is a nongelatin-based, biodegradable, polymer matrix.\n【111】 Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer's labeling.\n【112】 Appropriate use: For the treatment of endometriosis, leuprolide can be used in combination with norethindrone acetate (referred to as add-back therapy) to reduce bone mineral density loss and reduce vasomotor symptoms associated with use of leuprolide acetate. Leuprolide in combination with norethindrone acetate (add-back therapy) is not indicated for the preoperative hematologic improvement of patients with anemia caused by heavy menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids.\n【113】 Dosage Forms: US\n【114】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【115】 Injectable, Intramuscular, as acetate:\n【116】 Generic: 22.5 mg (1 ea)\n【117】 Kit, Injection, as acetate:\n【118】 Generic: 1 mg/0.2 mL\n【119】 Kit, Intramuscular, as acetate:\n【120】 Lupron Depot (1-Month): 7.5 mg [latex free; contains polysorbate 80]\n【121】 Lupron Depot (6-Month): 45 mg [latex free; contains polysorbate 80]\n【122】 Lupron Depot-Ped (6-Month): 45 mg [latex free; contains polysorbate 80]\n【123】 Kit, Intramuscular, as acetate [preservative free]:\n【124】 Lupron Depot (1-Month): 3.75 mg [latex free; contains polysorbate 80]\n【125】 Lupron Depot (3-Month): 11.25 mg, 22.5 mg [latex free; contains polysorbate 80]\n【126】 Lupron Depot (4-Month): 30 mg [latex free; contains polysorbate 80]\n【127】 Lupron Depot-Ped (1-Month): 7.5 mg, 11.25 mg, 15 mg [latex free; contains polysorbate 80]\n【128】 Lupron Depot-Ped (3-Month): 30 mg (Ped), 11.25 mg (Ped) [latex free; contains polysorbate 80]\n【129】 Kit, Subcutaneous, as acetate:\n【130】 Eligard: 7.5 mg, 22.5 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg [contains methylpyrrolidone, polylactide-coglycolide]\n【131】 Fensolvi (6 Month): 45 mg\n【132】 Fensolvi (6 Month): 45 mg [contains methylpyrrolidone, polylactide-coglycolide]\n【133】 Prefilled Syringe, Subcutaneous, as mesylate [preservative free]:\n【134】 Camcevi: 42 mg (1 ea) [latex free]\n【135】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【136】 May be product dependent\n【137】 Pricing: US\n【138】 22.5 mg (per each): $1,626.08\n【139】 7.5 mg (per each): $542.03\n【140】 30 mg (per each): $2,168.11\n【141】 45 mg (per each): $3,252.16\n【142】 45 mg (per each): $29,870.02\n【143】 3.75 mg (per each): $1,960.39\n【144】 7.5 mg (per each): $2,336.11\n【145】 11.25 mg (per each): $5,881.22\n【146】 22.5 mg (per each): $7,008.31\n【147】 30 mg (per each): $9,344.44\n【148】 45 mg (per each): $14,016.85\n【149】 7.5 mg (per each): $2,358.36\n【150】 11.25 mg (per each): $4,281.55\n【151】 15 mg (per each): $4,715.70\n【152】 11.25 mg (ped) (per each): $12,844.70\n【153】 30 mg (per each): $14,147.16\n【154】 45 mg (per each): $28,294.31\n【155】 42 mg (per each): $4,974.84\n【156】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【157】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【210】 Reproductive Considerations\n【211】 Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use and throughout treatment in patients who could become pregnant; pregnancy should be excluded prior to use.\n【212】 Treatment with leuprolide usually inhibits ovulation and stops menstruation; however, contraception is not ensured. When contraception is indicated, a nonhormonal contraceptive should be used during leuprolide therapy.\n【213】 Leuprolide suppresses ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis. Decreased libido, impotence, erectile dysfunction, and menstrual disorders may result and fertility may be impaired. Suppression of fertility is reversible following discontinuation of leuprolide. Pregnancy rates are not expected to be affected once leuprolide is discontinued. When used to treat pain associated with endometriosis in patients who are infertile, fertility is not improved by leuprolide treatment (ASRM 2012).\n【214】 Leuprolide is used off label to suppress menstruation and preserve ovarian function and fertility in patients undergoing chemotherapy; however, leuprolide is not considered to be an effective contraceptive; a nonhormonal contraceptive is recommended when leuprolide is used during chemotherapy (ACOG 2018; ACOG 2021).\n【215】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【216】 Based on the mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, in utero exposure to leuprolide may cause fetal harm. Use is contraindicated during pregnancy.\n【217】 Monitoring Parameters\n【218】 Baseline: Luteinizing hormone (LH) (basal or stimulated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonist), sex steroids, bone age assessment (versus chronological age), and growth parameters (height and weight measurements).\n【219】 During therapy: GnRH testing (serum LH and follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] levels) (every 6 to 12 months); testosterone in males and estradiol in females (IM [monthly] and SUBQ short-acting formulations: 1 to 2 months after initiation of therapy and with dosage change; IM [3 month] formulation: 2 to 3 months after initiation of therapy, month 6, and as clinically indicated thereafter; IM [6 month] formulation: 5 to 6 months after initiation of therapy and as clinically appropriate or to confirm maintained efficacy; SUBQ [6 month formulation]: 1 to 2 months after initiation of therapy and as needed to confirm adequate suppression and progression of secondary sexual characteristics); Tanner stage (Sexual Maturity Rating), growth (growth velocity, height [SUBQ short-acting, IM (monthly or 3-month) formulations: every 3 to 6 months; IM (6 month) formulation: every 6 to 12 months]); bone age periodically. Routine or random stimulated measurements of gonadotropins or sex steroids may be used, particularly if suboptimal response; however, FSH levels not typically used (ESPE/LWPES [Carel 2009]).\n【220】 Mechanism of Action\n【221】 Leuprolide is an agonist of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors. Acting as a potent inhibitor of gonadotropin secretion, leuprolide produces an initial increase in luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), which leads to a transient increase (5 to 12 days [Cook 2000]) in testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (in males) and estrone and estradione (in premenopausal females). Continuous leuprolide administration then results in suppression of ovarian and testicular steroidogenesis due to decreased levels of LH and FSH with subsequent decrease in testosterone (male) and estrogen (female) levels. In males, testosterone levels are reduced to below castrate levels. Leuprolide may also have a direct inhibitory effect on the testes, and act by a different mechanism not directly related to reduction in serum testosterone.\n【222】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【223】 Onset of action: Following transient increase, testosterone suppression occurs in ~2 to 4 weeks of continued therapy.\n【224】 Onset of therapeutic suppression for precocious puberty: Leuprolide: 2 to 4 weeks; Leuprolide depot: 1 month.\n【225】 Distribution: Males: Vd: 27 L.\n【226】 Protein binding: 43% to 49%.\n【227】 Metabolism: Metabolized to smaller inactive peptides, then may be further catabolized; Major metabolite, pentapeptide (M-1).\n【228】 Bioavailability: SUBQ: 94%.\n【229】 Half-life elimination: ~3 hours.\n【230】 Time to peak: Camcevi: 3.2 hours (first dose) and 2.1 hours (second dose); Eligard: ~5 hours (7.5 mg), ~3.3 hours (30 mg), or ~4.5 hours (45 mg).\n【231】 Excretion: Urine (<5% as parent and major metabolite).\n【232】 Clearance: Camcevi: 7.6 L/hour; Eligard: 8.34 L/hour.\n【233】 Brand Names: International\n【234】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Leuprolide  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/leuprolide-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E7%9F%AD%E8%82%8B%E7%BB%BC%E5%90%88%E5%BE%81&source=search_result&selectedTitle=143%7E144&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:51", "update_time": "2024-03-04 01:27:55"}

Our recommendations are largely consistent with 2017 guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology and the Maastricht V consensus report . The epidemiology, pathophysiology, and immune response to H. pylori and treatment regimens for H. pylori infection are discussed separately.   \"Pathophysiology of and immune response to Helicobacter pylori infection\" and  \"Acute and chronic gastritis due to Helicobacter pylori\" and  \"Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastrointestinal malignancy\" and  \"Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and duodenal ulcer\" and  \"Bacteriology and epidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection\" and  \"Treatment regimens for Helicobacter pylori in adults\".)\n【3】 INDICATIONS FOR TESTING — Testing for H. pylori should be performed only if the clinician plans to offer treatment for positive results. Indications for testing include :\n【4】 Evidence to support testing for H. pylori in individuals with pathogenic variants associated with specific inherited cancer syndromes is discussed in detail, separately.   \"Risk factors for gastric cancer\", section on 'Familial predisposition'.)\n【5】 Other indications for testing for H. pylori are more controversial. These indications include :\n【6】 There are insufficient data to support routine testing for H. pylori in patients with lymphocytic gastritis, hyperplastic gastric polyps, and hyperemesis gravidarum.   \"Gastric polyps\", section on 'Hyperplastic polyps' and  \"Gastric cancer screening\", section on 'Helicobacter pylori eradication'.)\n【7】 APPROACH TO DIAGNOSTIC TESTING — The choice of test used to diagnose H. pylori depends on whether a patient requires an upper endoscopy for evaluation of symptoms or surveillance. Endoscopy is not indicated solely for the purpose of establishing H. pylori status. Other important determinants include the recent use of medications that can suppress the bacterial load of H. pylori (eg, proton pump inhibitor therapy [PPI], antibiotics, and bismuth), the prevalence of H. pylori, test availability, and cost. A suggested approach to initial diagnostic testing in a patient with suspected H. pylori is outlined in the algorithm (algorithm 1).\n【8】 Medications that should be discontinued prior to testing — PPI use within one to two weeks and bismuth/antibiotic use within four weeks of testing can decrease the sensitivity of all endoscopy-based tests and noninvasive tests of active H. pylori infection (stool antigen and urea breath test). Patients should be advised to stop PPI therapy one to two weeks prior to testing. If feasible, testing should performed at least four weeks after completion of bismuth/antibiotic treatment.\n【9】 Patient undergoing upper endoscopy — Among patients undergoing upper endoscopy, the choice of test to diagnose H. pylori and extent of testing varies based on the clinical presentation and endoscopic findings.\n【10】 Patients not undergoing upper endoscopy — In patients who do not require endoscopic evaluation, the diagnosis of H. pylori should be made with a test for active infection (stool antigen assay or urea breath test). In clinical situations where patients are unable or unwilling to stop PPI therapy one to two weeks prior to testing, positive test results are true positives; negative results may represent false negatives and should be confirmed with repeat testing after stopping PPI therapy for one to two weeks. Serologic testing for H. pylori should be avoided altogether. If performed in areas of low prevalence of H. pylori, positive results should be confirmed with a test for active infection prior to initiating eradication therapy.  'Serology' below.)\n【11】 DIAGNOSTIC TESTS — Diagnostic testing for H. pylori can be divided into invasive (endoscopic) and noninvasive techniques, based upon the use of upper endoscopy. Endoscopy-based tests, the urea breath test, and the stool antigen assay test for active H. pylori infection.\n【12】 Endoscopic testing — The diagnosis of H. pylori can usually be established during endoscopy by one of three methods: biopsy urease test, histology, and much less commonly by bacterial culture.  'Patient undergoing upper endoscopy' above and 'Confirm eradication in all patients' below.)\n【13】 Biopsy urease testing — Gastric biopsy specimens are placed in a medium that contains urea and a pH reagent. Urease cleaves urea to liberate ammonia, producing an alkaline pH and a resultant color change. Commercially available urease testing kits differ in the use of medium (agar versus membrane pad) and testing reagents and the time to obtain a final result (1 to 24 hours).\n【14】 The sensitivity and specificity of biopsy urease testing is approximately 90 and 95 percent, respectively . With the rapid urease testing kits, results are obtained in one hour. One hour sensitivity and specificity of rapid urease tests are comparable (89 to 98 percent and 89 to 93 percent, respectively) to those seen with agar gel tests at 24 hours and superior to agar gel tests at one hour . False-negative results can occur in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding or with the use of PPIs, antibiotics, or bismuth-containing compounds . In such patients it is recommended that samples be taken from the both the gastric antrum and the fundus to increase the sensitivity of the test . Increasing the number of gastric biopsy specimens from one to four also increases the sensitivity of the test .\n【15】 Although biopsy urease kits are inexpensive, the cost is greater than that of a simple diagnostic endoscopy due to the addition of the biopsy and the resultant \"upcoding\" of the procedure to esophagogastroduodenoscopy with biopsy. Nevertheless, biopsy urease testing is less expensive as compared with histology.\n【16】 Histology — Gastric biopsies can diagnose of H. pylori infection and associated lesions (eg, atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT] lymphoma). Biopsies for histology should be taken from both the antrum and body of the stomach, especially when looking for evidence of multifocal atrophic gastritis\n【17】 The sensitivity and specificity of histology for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection are 95 and 98 percent, respectively. The sensitivity of histology may be decreased in patients with acute peptic ulcer bleeding and in patients on PPI therapy due to the proximal migration of H. pylori to the corpus from the antrum. Even in the absence of PPI use, the density of H. pylori can vary at different sites and interpretation of histologic slides is associated with interobserver variability .  'Patient undergoing upper endoscopy' above.)\n【18】 Bacterial culture and sensitivity testing — Biopsies for culture should be obtained before the forceps are contaminated with formalin. The tissue should be placed into a container with a few drops of saline. This preparation will allow for culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing. While bacterial culture has high specificity, it has low sensitivity as H. pylori is difficult to culture. Microcapillary culturing methods and improved transport media may improve sensitivity .  'Confirm eradication in all patients' below and  \"Treatment regimens for Helicobacter pylori in adults\", section on 'Treatment failure'.)\n【19】 Noninvasive testing — Noninvasive tests for the diagnosis of H. pylori include urea breath testing (UBT), stool antigen testing, and serology. Of these, UBT and stool antigen assay are tests of active infection. H. pylori serology can be positive in patients with an active or prior infection.\n【20】 Urea breath testing — UBT is based upon the hydrolysis of urea by H. pylori to produce CO2 and ammonia. Urea with a labeled carbon isotope (nonradioactive 13C or radioactive 14C) is given by mouth; H. pylori liberate labeled CO2 that can be detected in breath samples. The tests can be performed in 15 to 20 minutes and have similar cost and accuracy. The dose of radiation in the 14C test is approximately 1 microCi which is equivalent to one day of background radiation exposure . Even though this dose of radiation is small, the nonradioactive 13C test is preferred in young children and pregnant women.   \"Radiation-related risks of imaging\", section on 'Special populations'.)\n【21】 The sensitivity and specificity of UBT are approximately 88 to 95 percent and 95 to 100 percent, respectively . Thus, false-positive results are uncommon. False-negative results may be observed in patients who are taking PPIs, bismuth, or antibiotics and in the setting of active peptic ulcer bleeding . The sensitivity but not specificity of the UBT is reduced in the setting of an active peptic ulcer bleed (67 and 93 percent, respectively) . It is unclear if the reduction in sensitivity is induced by the bleeding process or by changes in the microenvironment of H. pylori to decrease the activity of urease.\n【22】 The effect of PPIs, which is presumably due to suppression of H. pylori, was illustrated in a series of 93 patients who had H. pylori infection documented by UBT . Treatment with lansoprazole was associated with a negative result on subsequent UBT in 33 percent of patients. Repeat breath test results 3, 7, and 14 days after stopping lansoprazole were positive in 91, 97, and 100 percent, respectively. In another study of 60 patients with biopsy-proven H. pylori infection who underwent UBT testing 7 and 14 days after treatment with lansoprazole false-negative rates with lansoprazole and bismuth were 40 and 55 percent, respectively . It is controversial whether H2RAs affect the sensitivity of the UBT .\n【23】 Stool antigen assay — The detection of bacterial antigen indicates an ongoing H. pylori infection. Stool antigen testing can therefore be used to establish the initial diagnosis of H. pylori and to confirm eradication . Of the available tests, stool antigen testing is the most cost effective in areas of low to intermediate prevalence of H. pylori .  'Patients not undergoing upper endoscopy' above and 'Confirm eradication in all patients' below.)\n【24】 The sensitivity and specificity of the laboratory-based monoclonal enzyme immunoassay (94 and 97 percent, respectively) are comparable to the UBT . Stool antigen testing is affected by the recent use of bismuth compounds, antibiotics, and PPIs. Although some data suggest that stool antigen test is predictive of eradication as early as seven days after completion of therapy, to reduce false-negative results, patients should be off antibiotics for four weeks, and PPIs for one to two weeks, prior to testing . In the setting of active bleeding from peptic ulcers, the specificity of the stool antigen testing may decrease . However, the sensitivity of the monoclonal enzyme immunoassay remains high in the setting of a recent peptic ulcer bleed. This was illustrated in a study in which 34 patients underwent inpatient stool antigen testing a mean of 2.8 days (range 0 to 8 days) after hospitalization for a bleeding peptic ulcer. The sensitivity of the monoclonal enzyme immunoassay in this study was 94 percent, significantly higher than a polyclonal enzyme immunoassay and a rapid monoclonal immunochromatographic stool test (74 and 60 percent, respectively).  'Patient undergoing upper endoscopy' above and 'Medications that should be discontinued prior to testing' above.)\n【25】 Stool antigen testing using the polyclonal enzyme immunoassay is no longer used given its low sensitivity. The rapid in-office monoclonal immunochromatographic stool antigen tests has high specificity but its adoption has been limited by its low sensitivity (96 and 50 percent, respectively) .  'Confirm eradication in all patients' below.)\n【26】 Serology — Laboratory-based ELISA test to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies is inexpensive and noninvasive. However, serologic tests require validation at the local level, which is impractical in routine practice. In addition, concerns over its accuracy have limited its use. Guidelines recommend that serologic testing should not be used in low prevalence populations as the low accuracy of serology would result in inappropriate treatment in significant numbers of patients .\n【27】 One meta-analysis that evaluated the performance of several commercially available serologic assays found an overall sensitivity and specificity of 85 and 79 percent, respectively . Inaccurate serologic tests are more common in older adults and in patients with cirrhosis in whom specificity can be decreased . Local prevalence of H. pylori affects the positive predictive value of antibody testing. In areas where the prevalence of H. pylori is less than 20 percent, as in much of the United States, a positive serologic test is more likely to be a false positive. As a result, secondary testing with a stool or breath test to confirm the initial result is appropriate before initiating treatment. However, a negative test in a patient with a low pretest probability for infection, is helpful to exclude infection. An example would be a young individual with dyspepsia and no evidence of peptic ulcer disease, especially in an area where the prevalence of H. pylori is low.\n【28】 Serology does not reliably distinguish between active and past infection. A quantitative ELISA test is generally used in research settings. It allows for determination of IgG titers of paired sera from the acute and convalescent (three to six months or longer) phase and can confirm eradication of the infection. However, this is not performed in clinical practice.\n【29】 Other infrequently used tests\n【30】 CONFIRM ERADICATION IN ALL PATIENTS — Confirmation of eradication should be performed in all patients treated for H. pylori because of increasing antibiotic resistance . Eradication can be confirmed with a urea breath test, stool antigen testing, or endoscopy-based testing. The choice of test depends on the need for an upper endoscopy (eg, follow-up of bleeding peptic ulcer) and local availability. Endoscopy with biopsy for culture and sensitivity should be performed in patients with persistent H. pylori infection after two courses of antibiotic treatment. Tests to confirm eradication should be performed at least four weeks after completion of antibiotic treatment . PPIs should be held for one to two weeks prior to testing to reduce false-negative results. Serologic testing should not be performed to confirm eradication as patients may continue to have antibodies after eradication .

An agent other than atomoxetine is preferred for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in women planning a pregnancy (Larsen 2015).\n【133】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【134】 In comparison to other agents used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), information related to atomoxetine use in pregnancy is limited (Bro 2015; Haervig 2014; Heiligenstein 2003; Ornoy 2018).\n【135】 If medication is needed for the treatment of ADHD during pregnancy, an agent other than atomoxetine is preferred. Consider discontinuing or changing treatment in patients who become pregnant during atomoxetine therapy (Larsen 2015).\n【136】 Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to atomoxetine is ongoing. Health care providers are encouraged to enroll patients exposed to atomoxetine during pregnancy in the National Pregnancy Registry for ADHD medications at 1-866-961-2388.\n【137】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【138】 It is not known if atomoxetine is present in breast milk.\n【139】 According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and the benefits of treatment to the mother. An agent other than atomoxetine is preferred for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in women who are breastfeeding (Larsen 2015).\n【140】 Monitoring Parameters\n【141】 Liver enzymes (upon signs/symptoms of liver dysfunction and for several weeks after discontinuation for liver dysfunction). Cardiac evaluation should be completed at baseline (medical history and family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, physical exam to assess for cardiac disease; further evaluation such as ECG if findings suggest cardiac disease) and on any patient who develops exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, and any symptom of cardiac disease during treatment. Monitor BP and heart rate (baseline, following dose increases and periodically during treatment); growth (weight and height) and appetite in children; weight in adults; sleep and behavioral changes. Closely monitor patients for clinical worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior, particularly during the initial few months of therapy or during periods of dosage adjustments (increases or decreases). Screen for risk factors for bipolar disorder (eg, personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, hypomania and depression) prior to therapy initiation; monitor for signs/symptoms of mania/hypomania during therapy.\n【142】 Mechanism of Action\n【143】 Selectively inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine (Ki 4.5 nM) with little to no activity at the other neuronal reuptake pumps or receptor sites.\n【144】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【145】 Duration of action: Up to 24 hours (Jain 2017)\n【146】 Absorption: Rapid\n【147】 Distribution: Vd: IV: 0.85 L/kg\n【148】 Protein binding: 98%, primarily albumin\n【149】 Metabolism: Hepatic, via CYP2D6 and CYP2C19; forms metabolites (4-hydroxyatomoxetine, active, equipotent to atomoxetine; N-desmethylatomoxetine, limited activity); Note: CYP2D6 poor metabolizers have atomoxetine AUCs that are ~10-fold higher and peak concentrations that are ~fivefold greater than extensive metabolizers; 4-hyroxyatomoxetine plasma concentrations are very low (extensive metabolizers: 1% of atomoxetine concentrations; poor metabolizers: 0.1% of atomoxetine concentrations\n【150】 Bioavailability: 63% in extensive metabolizers; 94% in poor metabolizers\n【151】 Half-life elimination: Atomoxetine: 5 hours (up to 24 hours in poor metabolizers); Active metabolites: 4-hydroxyatomoxetine: 6-8 hours; N-desmethylatomoxetine: 6-8 hours (34-40 hours in poor metabolizers)\n【152】 Time to peak, plasma: 1-2 hours; delayed 3 hours by high-fat meal\n【153】 Excretion: Urine (80%, as conjugated 4-hydroxy metabolite; <3% is excreted unchanged); feces (17%)\n【154】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【155】 Altered kidney function: Extensive metabolizers with ESRD had higher systemic exposure (approximately a 65% increase), but there was no difference when exposure was corrected for mg/kg dose.\n【156】 Hepatic function impairment: AUC is increased in extensive metabolizers with moderate or severe hepatic impairment.\n【157】 Brand Names: International\n【158】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Atomoxetine  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/atomoxetine-drug-information?search=%E8%86%80%E8%83%B1%E9%A2%88%E6%A2%97%E9%98%BB&source=search_result&selectedTitle=142%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:51", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:10:30"}

Migalastat reversibly binds to the active site of the alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) protein (encoded by the galactosidase alpha gene, GLA), which is deficient in Fabry disease. Binding to the active site stabilizes alpha-Gal A allowing trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum into the site of action, the lysosome.\n【64】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【65】 Distribution: Vz/F: ~89 L (range: 77 to 133 L).\n【66】 Protein binding: None detected.\n【67】 Metabolism: Dehydrogenated to 3 O-glucuronide conjugated minor metabolites (M1 to M3).

Neural foramina are bounded superiorly and inferiorly by pedicles, anteriorly by the intervertebral disc and vertebral body, and posteriorly by facet joints .\n【3】 Through each neural foramen passes the same numbered spinal nerve root, recurrent meningeal nerves, and radicular blood vessels. On each side there are five lumbar, five sacral, and one coccygeal spinal nerve roots.\n【4】 All lumbar and sacral spinal nerve roots originate at the T10 to L1 vertebral level, where the spinal cord terminates at the conus medullaris. A dorsal (somatic sensory) root from the posterolateral aspect of the spinal cord and a ventral (somatic motor) root from the anterolateral aspect of the cord join in the spinal canal to form the spinal nerve root  foramina. Thus, the lumbosacral nerve roots exit the spinal canal at a lower level than where they arise. A potential consequence of this arrangement is that intraspinal pathology may affect roots at higher levels than the level where the roots exit .\n【5】 Cell bodies of the motor nerve fibers are located in the ventral (anterior) horns of the spinal cord, while those of the sensory nerve fibers are in a dorsal root ganglion (DRG) at each lumbar and sacral level. DRG tend to be located within the neural foramina, and are therefore not strictly speaking intraspinal (ie, within the lumbar canal). However, at the low lumbar and sacral levels there is a tendency for DRG to reside proximal to the neural foramina, within the intraspinal canal, as found in 11 to 38 percent of cases at L5 and 71 percent at S1 . The DRG are attached to the vertebral body on the transverse process . Compressive radicular disease typically occurs proximal to this.\n【6】 As noted above, the spinal cord normally terminates at the conus medullaris within the lumbar intraspinal canal between the T10 and L1 vertebral levels. Exceptions include patients with congenital spinal deformities known as spina bifida, in which the fetal conus is tethered to ligamentous or bony structures, causing lengthening of the spinal cord during development. In such patients, the conus medullaris can be displaced downward to the middle or lower lumbar spine.\n【7】 The dorsal rami of the spinal nerves also supply the apophyseal joints and the paraspinal muscles. They innervate structures both above and below the level of the nerve. Clinical evaluation of injury to the dorsal rami is difficult because of the overlap in areas innervated by these nerves and because of the limited ability to clinically evaluate individual paraspinal muscles. However, electromyography (EMG) can be helpful in determining the distribution of disease.\n【8】 The ventral rami innervate the extremities and the trunk. These branches can be evaluated by assessing the motor and sensory functions of the different myotomes and dermatomes, respectively. However, variability to the dermatomal and myotomal distribution of innervation exists .\n【9】 The primary manifestations of lumbosacral root disease can be broken up into dysfunction of two distinct systems: motor and sensory. Motor dysfunction from a root lesion may cause weakness in some or all muscles innervated by that root. However, many muscles have innervation from multiple roots, which may result in preserved strength despite significant involvement of a single root.\n【10】 Although there are classic descriptions for the distributions of myotomes and dermatomes, substantial variability exists in these distributions from person to person . Sensory fields have considerable overlap, but there are areas that are exclusively served by individual nerves. These areas are called autonomous zones. The most important of these in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathies include the sole of the foot (S1), dorsum of the foot (L5), medial calf (L4), and anterior thigh (L2 and 3) .\n【11】 Lumbosacral myotomes are listed in the table .\n【12】 Irritation of the sinuvertebral nerves may result in low back pain. Because they arise distal to the nerve root, however, involvement of sinuvertebral nerves or their branches without involvement of the rest of the nerve root is not considered to be radicular in nature.\n【13】 Additional etiologies include nonskeletal causes of nerve root compression and noncompressive mechanisms such as infection, inflammation, neoplasm, and vascular disease.\n【14】 Resulting bony overgrowth (osteophytes) or disc herniation at these points may directly impinge on spinal nerve roots or the spinal cord, or their effect may be primarily to produce instability and misalignment of the spine (ie, degenerative spondylolisthesis) that in turn produces pain and neurologic deficits . It is not known whether changes in these different structures are causally related or occur independently.\n【15】 Degenerative spondylotic changes are common with aging and usually do not result in radiculopathy. Low back pain associated with degenerative changes is distinct from radicular pain and is much more frequent. Given the inability to ascertain the exact cause, it is commonly referred to as nonspecific low back pain.\n【16】 One school of thought suggests that degenerative spondylotic change is led by age-related change in the nucleus pulposus of the disc. With age there is gradual narrowing of the disc space coincident with changes in disc proteoglycan composition. Later, cracks develop in the disc, and deposits of gas and calcification may form. Eventually the disc material becomes desiccated and friable.\n【17】 Age-related changes also occur in the annulus fibrosus  studies.\n【18】 Accompanying this disc degeneration are changes at the vertebral body endplates adjacent to the disc. The marrow undergoes fibrovascular change or fatty marrow replacement. Finally, endplate sclerosis develops. Osteophyte formation occurs at the margins of the vertebral bodies. What triggers osteophyte formation is unclear, although spinal movement at ligamentous attachment sites and loss of buffering tissues between bony surfaces likely play roles. Osteophyte production appears to slow as advancing spondylosis leads to decreasing spinal movement.\n【19】 Facet joint degeneration may not be directly related to spondylotic changes, but often coexists. Disc degeneration is likely to put additional weight-bearing strains on facet joints, which are not weight-bearing structures. With unnatural movement of the spine, the synovial joint bears more structural burden, degenerates, and develops osteophytes. These osteophytes grow into the posterior aspect of the neural foramen (image 1).\n【20】 Depending upon the nature and location of intraspinal compression, roots may be injured at any disc level, from the L1-2 level to the level of their exit into their neural foramina. For example, the L5 root can be compressed by a central disc protrusion at the L2-3 or L3-4 level, a posterolateral (paracentral) disc protrusion at the L4-5 level (image 2), or far lateral disc protrusion into the foramen at the L5-S1 level (image 3). Because of the presence of multiple spinal nerve roots in the cauda equina, there is increased likelihood of multiple, bilateral simultaneous nerve root compressions.\n【21】 Nerve root injury may be complete or only partial and thus may involve all or only a subset of root fibers. With partial injury, incomplete myotomal involvement may result, making the distinction between a radiculopathy and a peripheral nerve injury more challenging.\n【22】 The lumbosacral spine is susceptible to disc herniations because of its mobility from flexion, extension, and torsion. Seventy-five percent of flexion and extension occurs at the lumbosacral joint . This level, on the other hand, has limited torsion. Twenty percent of flexion and extension occurs at L4-L5. The remaining 5 percent occurs between L1 and L3 . As the L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels are most susceptible to injuries from routine movements of the spine, approximately 90 to 95 percent of compressive radiculopathies occur at these levels . The incidence of radiculopathies is split somewhat evenly between L4-L5 and L5-S1, as the lack of torsion at L5-S1 helps to increase its stability despite its higher degree of flexion and extension . Next in frequency is L4. Other levels are uncommon.\n【23】 Far lateral herniations are  .\n【24】 Root avulsion is a rare cause of lumbosacral radiculopathy that may occur with fractures of the sacroiliac joint or with diastasis of the symphysis pubis or the pubic rami .\n【25】 There is generally complete involvement of the root with radiculitis caused by leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, cytomegalovirus, or herpes zoster.\n【26】 With leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the source may be metastases from breast cancer, lung cancer and melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or leukemia . Nerve roots may be encased by tumor cells causing compression and ischemia.\n【27】 Cytomegalovirus radiculitis occurs in immunosuppressed patients with very low CD4 counts. It is characterized by severe paresthesia and sensory loss and weakness. Both small and large nerve fibers are involved. There may also be bowel and bladder dysfunction from diminished sphincter tone. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may reveal increased protein, decreased glucose, and a polymorphonuclear pleocytosis. Polymerase chain reaction may be positive for cytomegalovirus .\n【28】 Herpes zoster colonizes the DRG and may remain latent for years. Reactivation is associated with a hemorrhagic lymphocytic infiltration of the ventral roots. Patients present with an erythematous vesicular maculopapular rash in the dermatome of the affected root that lasts for three to five days. Sensory changes characterized by marked allodynia often follow . When the motor nerve root is involved (so-called segmental zoster) a clinical picture of radiculopathy with weakness occurs in affected myotomes.\n【29】 Root infarction may occur from either large-vessel or small-vessel disease. It is most commonly\n【30】 Radiculopathy may also arise in the absence of obvious compression, leading to the hypothesis that the injury may be due to a chemical radiculitis, perhaps caused by the rupture of the annulus fibrosus with subsequent release of inflammatory mediators tracking along the nerve root sheath . Electromyography (EMG) may be abnormal even though compression is not observed on imaging studies.\n【31】 Large fibers carry motor efferent and sensory information involved with vibratory sense and conscious and unconscious proprioception. The typical clinical findings of large-fiber involvement in radiculopathies are weakness and reflex abnormalities. Deep tendon reflexes may be diminished or lost. Clinical testing for proprioception and vibratory sense tends to extend across different dermatomes and thus is often not as helpful in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathies as small-fiber modalities, as discussed below.\n【32】 The smaller myelinated A-delta fibers and unmyelinated C fibers carry pain and temperature information. A-delta fibers transmit cold sensation, while C fibers subserve warm sensation. Isolated injury to these fibers is not common in lumbosacral radiculopathies. However, their dermatomal distributions tend to be more specific than those of the large fibers, increasing their importance in the clinical evaluation of radiculopathies.\n【33】 In addition, dysfunction of A-delta and C fibers even in the absence of overt nerve root compression may play a significant role in the symptomatology of radiculopathies. A study of warm and cold sensory thresholds in 32 patients with unilateral L5 or S1 radiculopathy and disc herniation found that warm thresholds (C fiber function) were impaired to a greater extent than cold thresholds (A-delta fibers) . Since it is thought that unmyelinated axons, such as C fibers, are less affected by compression than myelinated ones, this finding suggests that the generation of lumbar radicular pain is mediated by inflammation more than by nerve root compression .\n【34】 Central pain sensitization may result from nerve root compression. Supporting evidence comes from a small study of patients with L5 or S1 radiculopathy that demonstrated a lowered pain threshold in the contralateral root, perhaps mediated by pre- and postsynaptic modulation of opioidergic interneurons .\n【35】 Acute back pain is the most common presenting complaint, often radiating around the anterior aspect of the thigh down into the knee and occasionally down the medial aspect of the lower leg as far as the arch of the foot. On examination, there may be weakness of hip flexion, knee extension, and hip adduction. Higher lesions may result in greater weakness of the hip flexors. Sensation may be reduced over the anterior thigh down to the medial aspect of the lower leg. A reduced knee reflex is common in the presence of moderate weakness.\n【36】 Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) may reveal abnormalities confined to muscles of the affected root(s), including the quadriceps, leg adductors, and iliopsoas, with associated paraspinal abnormalities. Saphenous sensory response remains normal even if sensory loss is prominent in the distal leg.\n【37】 Sensory loss is confined to the lateral aspect of the lower leg and dorsum of the foot, but may be obvious only when testing sharp sensation in the web space between the first and second digits. Reflexes are generally normal, although the internal hamstring reflex may be diminished on the symptomatic side.\n【38】 EMG and NCS typically show abnormalities in the L5 muscles, including the gluteus medius, tensor fascia lata, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, tibialis posterior, and the L5 paraspinals. Sensory studies (sural and superficial peroneal responses) are normal since the lesion is almost always proximal to the dorsal root ganglion (DRG).\n【39】 EMG and NCS reveal abnormalities in S1 innervated muscles, including the gluteus maximus, long and short heads of the biceps femoris, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles, and the S1 paraspinals, with intact sensory responses (sural generally tested) . Soleus H reflex is usually absent in patients with significant S1 radiculopathy. Testing should be performed bilaterally to identify asymmetric amplitude loss or latency prolongation on the affected side.   \"Overview of nerve conduction studies\", section on 'H reflex'.)\n【40】 The utility of EMG and NCS of the legs for the evaluation of S2, S3, and S4 radiculopathy is limited. However, EMG investigation of the low paraspinal muscles may be helpful. In addition, abnormalities may be identified in gluteus maximus and gastrocnemius. Sensory studies are normal. Prolongations in latency when performing electrical bulbocavernosus reflex testing may indicate a lesion in the region, although this is not specific for radiculopathy.\n【41】 Disc herniation and foraminal stenosis due to spondylotic degeneration are the most common etiologies for lumbosacral radiculopathy . Nevertheless, testing is suggested to confirm the diagnosis and etiology for patients who have persistent symptoms that are not adequately controlled with conservative therapy and who are candidates for invasive treatment options.\n【42】 We recommend urgent neuroimaging in the initial assessment for patients with any of the following conditions :\n【43】 If imaging is negative or equivocal, nerve conduction studies (NCS) and electromyography (EMG) may be useful three weeks or more after symptom onset to identify nonstructural causes of lumbosacral radiculopathy and lumbosacral polyradiculopathy.\n【44】 A lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis can be diagnostic for patients with a suspected inflammatory or infectious cause of lumbosacral radiculopathy if the etiology cannot be determined in other ways. However, there are theoretical risks with lumbar puncture in the setting of epidural abscess or other epidural infectious processes. One is that lumbar puncture in the presence of complete canal obstruction by the infectious mass could cause a differential in CSF pressure above and below the obstruction, leading to stretching of neural elements (ie, herniation). Another is that infection could be inadvertently carried into the intrathecal space by the lumbar puncture needle. In addition to these concerns, the diagnostic yield of lumbar puncture for epidural abscess is low, as discussed separately.   \"Spinal epidural abscess\", section on 'Diagnosis'.)\n【45】 The most useful modalities in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), NCS, and EMG. An MRI scan of the lumbosacral spine will identify most pathologic states that may benefit from surgical intervention. CT or MRI myelography can assess the anatomy of the root sleeve. The sensitivities of CT and MRI are similar for compressive radiculopathies . NCS and EMG have a high diagnostic accuracy for radiculopathy when neurologic weakness is present for at least three weeks.\n【46】 Plain radiographs of the lumbar spine are of limited value in the evaluation of lumbosacral radiculopathy. They can visualize bony structures but do not detect herniated discs. Thus, plain radiographs are not recommended in the work-up of lumbosacral radiculopathy unless there is a need to evaluate for infection, fracture, malignancy, spondylolisthesis, degenerative changes, disc space narrowing, or prior surgery. However, normal plain films do not exclude malignancy or infection in patients with a suspicious history.   \"Evaluation of low back pain in adults\", section on 'Modalities'.)\n【47】 Similarly, weakness confined to the muscles in a particular lumbosacral myotome should raise suspicion for radiculopathy, though few people spontaneously report such specific complaints. Inability to get up from a chair suggests iliopsoas or quadriceps weakness, while buckling of the knee is consistent with quadriceps weakness, and dragging of the toe points to tibialis anterior weakness.\n【48】 Elucidation of triggering and alleviating factors may also be helpful. Radicular pain that worsens with Valsalva or improves while lying down suggests a compressive etiology. Conversely, radicular pain that worsens with lying down may suggest an inflammatory or neoplastic etiology. However, such symptoms have not been shown to be sensitive or specific for these conditions.\n【49】 The acute onset of symptoms with bending, lifting, or trauma may herald a radiculopathy. In large series, approximately 30 to 50 percent of patients identify an inciting event, most commonly nonlifting activities (eg, bending, slipping without falling, vacuuming, recreational sports), heavy lifting, falls, and motor vehicle accidents . However, none of these factors are specific for radiculopathy.\n【50】 Additional procedures (eg, straight leg raising, reverse straight leg raising) may be useful, but their specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility are variably limited. Vertebral tenderness is suggestive of infection but is not specific enough to be clinically useful . The spine should be evaluated for any cutaneous abnormalities, such as tufts of hair, nevi, or pores that may be suggestive of a neural tube developmental abnormality.\n【51】 Muscle stretch reflexes should be assessed at both the quadriceps (L2/L3/L4) and Achilles (S1). The internal hamstring reflex can be useful in assessing a suspected L5 radiculopathy , but its correct performance requires experience. It is sometimes difficult to elicit in heavyset people. An experienced clinician may try to elicit this reflex by tapping the semitendinosus and semimembranosus (internal hamstring muscles) tendons just proximal to the popliteal fossa. Side-to-side asymmetries are usually significant.\n【52】 The sensory examination is more subjective than other parts of the neurologic examination and is further confounded by dermatomal overlap and variability. However, it can provide important information for localization. Thus, we suggest testing the relevant lumbosacral dermatomes for light touch, pain, and temperature. Vibratory sensation and proprioception are usually not useful for evaluating radiculopathies.\n【53】 However, there is a high prevalence of abnormal neuroimaging findings in asymptomatic individuals, including some who have what appears to be frank nerve root compression by MRI . As an example, one study of 98 people without back pain found MRI evidence of disc herniation in 27 percent . Furthermore, lumbar spine abnormalities on MRI in asymptomatic patients do not appear to be predictive for the future development or duration of low back pain .\n【54】 Although rarely indicated, CT myelography can visualize spinal nerve roots and their trajectory through the neural foramina. It is useful for patients with intolerance of or contraindications to MRI (eg, implanted electrical devices such as cardiac pacemakers or defibrillators) when standard CT fails to define the anatomic correlates of the clinical presentation. In addition, CT myelography is preferred for patients who have surgically placed spinal hardware that produces magnetic artifacts.\n【55】 A CT scan can assess osseous structures better than either plain radiography or MRI and is therefore helpful in assessing for bony disease. However, CT alone is unable to visualize nerve roots, so it is not helpful in the direct imaging of a radicular process.\n【56】 In a systematic review of evidence published through mid-2006, the American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic Medicine (AANEM) assessed the utility of electrodiagnostic testing for patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy . The AANEM noted that the available data are limited by the lack of a universally accepted \"gold standard\" definition for the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy, thus preventing comparison of sensitivities and specificities reported by the included studies. With this caveat in mind, the AANEM concluded that the following tests probably aid the clinical diagnosis:\n【57】 The AANEM observed that the available evidence suggests a low sensitivity for peroneal and posterior tibial F waves .\n【58】 In patients with weakness due to radiculopathy, NCS and EMG together can localize the specific spinal nerve root that is damaged, distinguish between old and new axon loss nerve damage, and provide indirect support for the presence of demyelinating conduction block at the root level . Electrodiagnostic testing also can identify conditions that mimic radiculopathy, such as mononeuropathies of the leg or lumbosacral plexopathy. In the absence of structural abnormalities on neuroimaging, NCS and EMG can assess for the presence of nonstructural disorders of spinal nerve roots and peripheral neuropathies that mimic root disease.\n【59】 From studies of the relative value of electrodiagnostic testing in the diagnosis of lumbosacral radiculopathy, the following observations have been made:\n【60】 Thus, these tests have overlapping diagnostic sensitivity but provide different kinds of information. When precision is needed to decide whether the neuroimaging findings are etiologically related to specific neurologic deficits, EMG is useful to support or refute this relationship. In particular, EMG may provide objective evidence of denervation when there is no motor deficit or uncertain motor deficit. In addition, EMG findings may help determine the timing of the denervation (eg, distant past versus ongoing). This is particularly useful in patients with past surgery and residual pain.\n【61】 In acute radiculopathy (ie, the first three weeks), EMG and NCS provide limited but potentially important information. The needle EMG examination is more sensitive and provides better localizing information than NCS, but is not likely to show prominent features of acute axon loss until three or more weeks after symptom onset. This is due to a two- to three-week delay in the development of fibrillation potentials after acute motor axon loss. In the face of marked weakness from acute radiculopathy, NCS can show loss of amplitude of compound muscle action potentials by day 8 after injury.\n【62】 NCS are carried out by applying an electrical stimulus to the skin overlying a nerve trunk, followed by the recording of the generated electrical response over either the nerve trunk or muscle innervated by it, at some distance from the stimulation. EMG records the electrical potentials generated in a muscle belly through a needle electrode inserted in the muscle. Both methods are discussed in detail elsewhere.   \"Overview of electromyography\" and  \"Overview of nerve conduction studies\".)\n【63】 CSF cytology can be diagnostic in patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, but it may be negative in 10 percent of cases . In such patients, CSF testing should be repeated if there is clinical suspicion for cancer. Other abnormalities in the CSF include a monocytic pleocytosis, decreased glucose, and increased protein.\n【64】 Radiculopathy may result from infectious causes, including Lyme disease, cytomegalovirus, and herpes zoster. CSF sampling will provide the diagnosis in the first two cases, and may be needed in the third when there is no characteristic rash.\n【65】 Since the treatment of radicular and nonradicular low back pain may differ, it is important to distinguish the two.\n【66】 Lumbosacral radiculopathies are often misdiagnosed in cases of nonradicular low back pain. This confusion is reinforced by the use of nonspecific nomenclature such as the term \"sciatica.\" Sciatica is often applied to conditions involving low back pain with or without radiation into the leg regardless the cause. Because of its nonspecific use, the term \"sciatica\" should be avoided if possible when referring to radicular pain.\n【67】 Diagnostic testing for low back pain is often equivocal. In such cases, the diagnosis is typically that of nonspecific low back pain. Lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal findings suggestive of root compression, though the patient may not have specific radicular signs or symptoms. Persistence of findings from remote root injury and intercurrent processes such as diabetic neuropathy may also be noted on electromyography (EMG), confounding the evaluation for a more acute problem.\n【68】 In a few patients with lumbar spinal stenosis, more fixed nerve root injury may occur, causing lumbosacral radiculopathy, and rarely cauda equina syndrome or conus medullaris syndrome.\n【69】 The cauda equina syndrome is typically associated with marked neurologic disability. The clinical presentation is dominated by bilateral leg weakness in multiple root distributions (L3-S1), and may be associated with perineal sensory symptoms as well as bowel, bladder, and sexual dysfunction due to involvement of the S2-4 spinal nerve roots.\n【70】 Potential etiologies include developmental abnormalities such as neural tube defects, infectious or inflammatory conditions, or mass lesions such as tumors.   \"Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression\".)\n【71】 The cauda equina syndrome is a rare complication of lumbar spinal stenosis.   \"Lumbar spinal stenosis: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis\".)\n【72】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Although ATL is often highly aggressive, the clinical presentation is variable and, in some cases, it is an indolent disorder. ATL is caused by chronic infection with the human T-lymphotropic virus, type I (HTLV-I).\n【2】 EPIDEMIOLOGY — ATL is an uncommon lymphoid neoplasm that occurs in patients with human T-lymphotropic virus, type I (HTLV-I) infection. Incidence varies by population according to the prevalence of HTLV-I infection . Infection with HTLV-1 is endemic in several islands in southwestern Japan, the Caribbean basin (eg, Jamaica and Trinidad), western Africa, Peru, northeast Iran, and the southeastern portion of the United States; most affected patients live in or originate from these areas .\n【3】 PATHOGENESIS — ATL is uniformly associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) infection of CD4-positive T cells, the cell of origin for the tumor ; this infection is thought to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of ATL. In xenograft models, the tumor-initiating cell appears to be an HTLV-I infected CD4-positive memory T cell with stem cell-like properties . All of the malignant cells in a particular tumor share the same HTLV-I proviral genomic integration site. Since proviral integration is believed to occur in a more or less random fashion, the clonal nature of proviral integration sites in tumors indicates that viral infection and integration must occur prior to malignant transformation and clonal expansion. It is unclear whether the particular insertion location affects the phenotype of the cell (eg, by dysregulating nearby genes).\n【4】 CLINICAL FEATURES — The clinical features of ATL include evidence of generalized lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, immunosuppression, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, and skin lesions. The frequency of these differs among patient groups and has been the basis on which clinical variants have been defined.\n【5】 Clinical variants — Several clinical variants of ATL have been described: acute, lymphomatous, chronic, and smoldering; these appear to have differing genomic alterations and different clinical courses . Progression from chronic and smoldering disease to aggressive disease resembling the acute variant eventually occurs in up to 25 percent of cases, and may be associated with specific changes on gene expression profiling .\n【6】 Acute — The most common presentation of ATL, occurring in about 60 percent of cases, is the acute variant, which has a generally poor prognosis with survival measured in months to a year despite aggressive treatment .   \"Treatment and prognosis of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma\".)\n【7】 Lymphomatous — The lymphomatous variant accounts for approximately 20 percent of cases and is characterized by prominent lymphadenopathy without blood involvement. Patients frequently have an elevated LDH level and can have hypercalcemia. Prognosis is poor with a survival similar to that of patients with the acute variant.\n【8】 Chronic — Approximately 10 percent of cases are a chronic variant. These patients present with skin lesions, mild lymphadenopathy, leukocytosis, and an absolute lymphocytosis that may be stable for months to years . Median survival is two to five years, however, there is a subgroup of patients with unfavorable chronic-type ATL, which is defined by a low serum albumin, high LDH, or high blood urea nitrogen concentration. These patients have a poor prognosis similar to that of the acute and lymphoma variants.\n【9】 Smoldering — The smoldering variant is least common, accounting for approximately 10 percent of cases. These patients are often asymptomatic except for skin and/or pulmonary lesions. They have normal blood lymphocyte counts with <5 percent circulating neoplastic cells and normal calcium levels. Median survival without treatment is approximately three years .\n【10】 Primary cutaneous tumoral — Primary cutaneous tumoral (PCT) ATL is a distinct subtype with cutaneous lesions that appear as rapidly growing tumors; it is a provisional subtype of ATL, according to a consensus meeting report . The cutaneous manifestations are primarily nodulo-tumoral and pathologic findings reveal a pleomorphic high-grade T cell lymphoma with medium or large cells, prominent perivascular infiltration, and scant epidermotropism . PCT-ATL is generally less aggressive than acute or lymphoma types, but it is more aggressive than chronic/smoldering type. It must be distinguished from other cutaneous T cell lymphomas, such as mycosis fungoides and peripheral T cell lymphoma.\n【11】 Hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions — As mentioned above, the frequency of hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions differs among the variants of ATL. In the acute variant, approximately 70 percent of patients with ATL will have hypercalcemia at some point in their disease course while 40 percent will have lytic bone lesions . Hypercalcemia can be severe with calcium levels as high as 21 mg/dL (5.25 mmol/liter). Signs and symptoms related to hypercalcemia such as renal dysfunction or neuropsychiatric disturbances may be prominent among the presenting clinical features. The clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia are discussed in more detail separately.   \"Clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia\".)\n【12】 Immunosuppression — Patients with ATL are immunosuppressed and at risk of developing opportunistic infections including pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, cryptococcus meningitis, and disseminated herpes zoster . Severe, and often fatal, infestation by disseminated Strongyloides stercoralis is common as well.   \"Strongyloidiasis\".)\n【13】 PATHOLOGY\n【14】 Morphology — The morphology of the tumor cells is quite variable from case to case, and a high index of suspicion on clinicopathologic grounds is helpful in arriving at an expeditious diagnosis. The organs involved vary, but can include the peripheral blood and bone marrow, lymph nodes, and skin.\n【15】 Peripheral blood and bone marrow — The most characteristic morphologic feature of ATL is  can be found, often resembling the Sézary cells of mycosis fungoides  . There is often a small proportion of blast-like cells with deeply basophilic cytoplasm, but not all ATL cells show morphologic atypia; many morphologically normal lymphocytes are leukemic cells. Bone marrow involvement is seen in approximately 35 percent of cases . Bone marrow infiltrates are usually patchy, ranging from sparse to moderate.\n【16】 Lymph nodes — Involved lymph nodes typically display diffuse architectural effacement, although at early stages of involvement the cells may preferentially accumulate in the T cell areas or sinusoids of the node. A wide range of morphologies may be seen. Most commonly, the neoplastic cells are medium to large-sized with nuclear pleomorphism; the cytoplasm is amphophilic, basophilic, or pale. Reed-Sternberg–like cells and multinucleated giant cells with convoluted or cerebriform nuclei may be present, causing a resemblance to Hodgkin lymphoma . Uncommonly, the tumor can be composed of small-sized lymphoid cells with nuclear pleomorphism, or may resemble anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Mitotic activity is variable. In the background, there is typically a mild to moderate proliferation of high endothelial venules.\n【17】 Other tissues — On occasion, ATL may present with skin infiltrates similar to those , with epidermotropism and Pautrier's microabscesses; such cases are more likely to be associated with an indolent course.   \"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mycosis fungoides\".)\n【18】 Immunophenotype — The origin of the malignant cell in ATL is a human T-lymphotropic virus, type I (HTLV-I) infected mature CD4+ T-lymphocyte. In a subset of cases, the tumor cells express the transcription factor FoxP3, a marker of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells (Tregs) . For purposes of diagnosis, suspected cases should be stained for CD3, CD4, CD7, CD8, and CD25 at a minimum. Tumor cells express T cell associated antigens (CD2, CD4, and CD5), but usually lack CD7 and may exhibit dim CD3 expression. Most cases are CD4+ and CD8- . Rare cases are CD4-/CD8+ or CD4+/CD8+. CD25 is expressed in a majority of the cases , as is CD52 . Anaplastic large cell variants react with CD30, but are negative for ALK protein and lack rearrangements involving the ALK gene.\n【19】 Genetics — There is no distinct molecular or karyotypic abnormality in ATL other than clonally integrated HTLV-1, which is observed in all malignant cells . Karyotypic analysis is generally reserved for patients enrolled in clinical trials. The T cell receptor genes are clonally rearranged .\n【20】 DIAGNOSIS — The diagnosis of ATL is based on a combination of characteristic clinical features, morphologic and immunophenotypic changes of the malignant cells, along with confirmation of human T-lymphotropic virus, type I (HTLV-I) infection . Identification of at least 5 percent tumor cells by cytology and immunophenotype in the peripheral blood with confirmation of HTLV-1 infection is often sufficient to make the diagnosis in patients with acute, chronic, or smoldering type ATL . Patients with lymphomatous lesions should undergo an excisional biopsy of an involved lymph node for histopathologic examination. Testing for clonal proviral integration is not routinely performed, and currently, the diagnosis is usually confirmed by tests for HTLV-1 specific antibodies and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests for the presence of provirus in peripheral blood cells.\n【21】 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — The differential diagnosis of ATL includes other T cell lymphoid malignancies such as cutaneous T cell lymphoma, T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma. Some cases of ATL can resemble Hodgkin disease morphologically.\n【22】 Asymptomatic healthy carriers of HTLV-1 — Flower cells similar to those  . Such cases may be difficult to distinguish from smoldering ATL. Southern blotting can be used to identify the clonal integration of HTLV-1 into the circulating cells of smoldering ATL , but is no longer available in most centers. An alternative is to use conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for T cell receptor gene rearrangements, which can be used to determine if a clonal T cell population is emerging.   \"Human T-lymphotropic virus type I: Virology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology\".)\n【23】 Cutaneous T cell lymphoma — ATL can be difficult to distinguish from forms of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), such as mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. Both of these disorders can have cutaneous manifestations with malignant T cells circulating in the peripheral blood and skin biopsy findings that are practically identical morphologically. They can also have a similar immunophenotype, as both may be CD4+, CD7-, and CD25+, though CD25 positivity usually is more variable in CTCL and confined to a minor subset of cells. The key distinguishing feature is the presence of HTLV-I in the malignant cells of ATL.   \"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of mycosis fungoides\".)\n【24】 T-prolymphocytic leukemia — Like ATL, T-prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is an aggressive malignancy. It is characterized by circulating malignant T lymphoid cells, marked lymphocytosis, cytopenias, and splenomegaly. Immunophenotype can help distinguish this disorder from ATL. As with ATL, T-PLL is CD4+. However, unlike ATL, T-PLL is CD7+ and CD25-. T-PLL is not associated with HTLV-I and >80 percent of tumors have genetic abnormalities, usually an inversion of chromosome 14 that fuses the TCL1 gene to the T cell receptor alpha/delta locus and leads to the overexpression of TCL1 protein.   \"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of T cell prolymphocytic leukemia\".)\n【25】 Anaplastic large cell lymphoma — Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is another T cell lymphoid neoplasm that primarily involves the lymph nodes and skin but can demonstrate circulating malignant cells. Cell morphology is varied and the tumor cells may be CD4+ and CD7-, like ATL. Immunohistochemistry staining can be of help since ALCL has strong, uniform expression of CD30 with a membrane and Golgi distribution and is usually cytotoxic granule-associated protein positive.\n【26】 Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma — Angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL) is one of the most common peripheral T cell lymphomas and usually presents with generalized systemic symptoms, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, bone marrow involvement, and a pruritic skin rash. Most patients demonstrate a polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. The morphology of the malignant cells is varied but one common feature is the prominent arborizing high endothelial venules not typically found in ATL. Immunophenotyping typically demonstrates CD4 positivity and decreased intensity of CD7; however, the cell of origin of AITL is a follicular helper T cell, and the tumor cell of AITL bears certain immunophenotypic features of follicular helper T cells, such as expression of PD-1, CXCL13, CD10, and BCL6, that are absent for ATL. Finally, unlike ATL, AITL is not HTLV-I associated.   \"Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma\".)\n【27】 TREATMENT — The treatment of ATL is discussed separately.   \"Treatment and prognosis of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma\".)\n【28】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Lymphoma diagnosis and staging\".)\n", "title": "成人T细胞白血病-淋巴瘤的临床表现、病理特征和诊断", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-adult-t-cell-leukemia-lymphoma?search=%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96B%E6%B7%8B%E5%B7%B4%E6%AF%8D%E7%BB%86%E8%83%9E%E7%99%BD%E8%A1%80%E7%97%85%2F%E6%B7%8B%E5%B7%B4%E7%98%A4%E4%BC%B4%E9%87%8D%E7%8E%B0%E6%80%A7%E9%81%97%E4%BC%A0%E5%AD%A6%E5%BC%82%E5%B8%B8&source=search_result&selectedTitle=7%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:51", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:17:19"}

As a group, they occur in 0.1 to 4.0 percent of the general population . Four general subtypes of congenital malformations include:\n【2】 AVMs may be subcategorized into pial AVMs and dural arteriovenous fistulas. Cavernous malformations have also been called cavernous angiomas, cavernous hemangiomas, and cavernomas. Developmental venous anomalies were previously also called venous angiomas.\n【3】 Developmental venous anomalies are most common in autopsy series, with an incidence of 2 percent . This is followed by arteriovenous malformations (1 percent), capillary telangiectasias (0.7 percent), and cavernous malformations (0.4 percent). Developmental venous anomalies and capillary telangiectasia are usually benign, while cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have a greater tendency toward neurologic sequelae.\n【4】 This topic will review cavernous malformations, developmental venous anomalies, and capillary telangiectasias. Cerebral and spinal cord arteriovenous malformations and carotid-cavernous fistulas are discussed separately.   \"Brain arteriovenous malformations\" and  \"Disorders affecting the spinal cord\", section on 'Vascular malformations' and  \"Carotid-cavernous fistulas\".)\n【5】 ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATIONS — Arteriovenous malformations are the most dangerous congenital vascular malformations. This topic is discussed separately.   \"Brain arteriovenous malformations\".)\n【6】 CAVERNOUS MALFORMATIONS\n【7】 Pathogenesis — Cavernous malformations (CMs) may occur sporadically or in a familial pattern .\n【8】 Familial CMs — Familial CM cases have an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern and are estimated to account for approximately 20 percent of all cases of CMs. Most familial cases have multiple CMs. Pathogenic variants in CCM1 (KRIT1), CCM2, and CCM3 (PDCD10) are known to cause familial CMs . The CCM proteins encoded by these three genes interact with each other and are involved with cellular signaling pathways, including formation of a CCM complex signaling platform. Loss of CCM proteins results in the dysregulation of signaling pathways in brain endothelial cells and eventual lesion formation . Most of the pathogenic variants constitute loss-of-function mutations involving nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutations, but larger deletions and duplications have also been reported .\n【9】 Nearly all familial cases of cerebral CMs among Hispanic Americans have been linked to a founder variant of KRIT1 . Familial cases in non-Hispanic White families have been linked to CCM2  and PDCD10 .\n【10】 CM may also be found in some patients with genetic conditions such as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.   \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome)\", section on 'Pathophysiology'.)\n【11】 Sporadic CMs — Approximately 80 percent of CMs are sporadic . Most sporadic cerebral CMs present as solitary lesions and are often associated with a developmental venous anomaly (DVA), but sporadic CMs occasionally present as multiple lesions around the periphery of a DVA .\n【12】 Sporadic CMs appear to be acquired lesions. De novo CMs have been demonstrated on serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) . CMs may also develop after cranial radiation therapy . Genetic susceptibilities may underly the development of CMs in some patients . Novel genetic variants in the CCM pathway were identified in one series of patients with sporadic CMs . In a cohort of 88 patients with sporadic CM, nearly 40 percent were found to have a somatic variant in the PIK3CA oncogene, compared with 10 percent with a variant in a CCM gene .\n【13】 Neuropathology — On gross examination, CMs have a characteristic \"mulberry\" or \"popcorn\" appearance with engorged purplish clusters. They vary from 2 mm to several centimeters in diameter. Microscopic examination reveals that CMs are composed of dilated, thin-walled capillaries with a simple endothelial lining and a thin, fibrous adventitia. Elastic fibers and smooth muscle are not present in the vessel walls. In the classic description of CMs, there is no intervening brain tissue between the channels of the lesion . However, this may not be an essential criterion of CMs, as one histopathologic study of 71 CM cases noted intervening brain parenchyma in 50 (70 percent) , and others have also noted intervening brain tissue in some fraction of cases .\n【14】 The immediately surrounding tissue is usually gliotic and hemosiderin laden due to previous hemorrhages. It contains dilated capillaries that may represent telangiectasias; this finding supports the integrative concept of capillary telangiectasias and CMs representing two ends of a spectrum in the development of CMs . Inflammation, calcification, and, rarely, ossification may be identified with CMs, usually in larger lesions .\n【15】 The cerebrum is the most common location for CMs (70 to 90 percent) . They have been reported throughout the supratentorial compartment, but most commonly are subcortical and predisposed to the rolandic and temporal areas. Posterior fossa lesions comprise approximately 25 percent of CMs in most large series, with the majority located in the pons and cerebellar hemispheres. Spinal cord CMs are intramedullary lesions and predominantly involve the cervical and thoracic regions . Intramedullary spinal cord CMs are more common than once recognized, with over 600 cases reported in a meta-analysis published in 2014 .\n【16】 DVAs may be associated with CMs, particularly in sporadic cases . In a series of 102 patients, DVAs associated with CMs were found in 23 percent; these occurred more often with lesions in the posterior fossa than the supratentorial compartment . A later series of 57 patients with CMs found associated DVAs in 25 percent, and atypical patterns of venous drainage associated with CMs were\n【17】 Epidemiology — The incidence of CMs is 0.15 to 0.56 per 100,000 in various populations . CMs occur with equal frequency in males and females, with a mean age of 30 to 40, although females more commonly present with hemorrhage and neurologic deficits .\n【18】 CMs may occur sporadically or in a familial pattern.  'Familial CMs' above and 'Sporadic CMs' above.)\n【19】 Clinical presentation — The presentation of CMs is specific to their location. A substantial proportion are asymptomatic and are found incidentally on brain MRI .\n【20】 Neuroimaging — MRI plays a key role in the identification and diagnosis of CMs .  'Confirming the diagnosis' below.)\n【21】 Evaluation and diagnosis\n【22】 Confirming the diagnosis — The diagnosis of CMs is based upon the characteristic radiologic appearance on MRI  'Neuroimaging' above). The diagnosis of familial CM is based upon detection of a pathogenic variant in one of the three genes (KRIT1, CCM2, or PDCD10) .\n【23】 Catheter angiography is generally not recommended for the detection of CMs unless arteriovenous malformation is a diagnostic consideration . Blood flow through CMs is minimal. Thus, they may not be seen on angiography and have been referred to as \"angiographically occult.\" CMs demonstrate a capillary blush or early draining vein in approximately 10 percent of patients . These findings may be similar to the angiographic appearance of meningiomas.\n【24】 Genetic testing — Genetic testing for pathogenic variants in CCM1 (KRIT1), CCM2, and CCM3 (PDCD10) is indicated for patients with multiple CMs on imaging, a history of brain radiation therapy, or a positive family history of CMs . Testing should include direct sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis.\n【25】 For new cases of CMs, clinicians should obtain a three-generation family history at the time of diagnosis, with particular attention to family members with a history of hemorrhagic stroke, abnormal MRI scan, epilepsy, or other neurologic complications . However, family history may be confounded by the incomplete penetrance and variable presentation, even within families, of familial CMs.\n【26】 Differential diagnosis — Lesions that mimic CMs on MRI include hemorrhagic or calcified neoplastic lesions, particularly hemorrhagic metastases (eg, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma), oligodendrogliomas, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, polymorphous low-grade neuroepithelial tumor of the young, and cerebral microbleeds .\n【27】 Management — The general management of CMs involves assessing the individual risk of future bleeding or other neurologic sequela. Most CMs are treated conservatively.\n【28】 The routine care and additional screening for patients with CM associated with other conditions are discussed separately.   \"Moyamoya disease and moyamoya syndrome: Treatment and prognosis\" and  \"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): Routine care including screening for asymptomatic AVMs\" and  \"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): Evaluation and therapy for specific vascular lesions\".)\n【29】 Asymptomatic lesions — Asymptomatic CMs are observed, irrespective of location . Management of asymptomatic CMs involves annual clinical follow-up with a specialist (eg, neurologist or neurosurgeon) . Some experts advocate annual imaging with brain MRI , but such an approach would not change management for patients who are asymptomatic.\n【30】 Immediate brain MRI is indicated for those who develop symptoms possibly related to CMs (eg, seizure, new headache, or new or progressive neurologic deficit) to evaluate for new hemorrhage or new CM .\n【31】 We agree that surgical resection is not recommended for asymptomatic CMs. However, some experts advise that surgical resection of a solitary asymptomatic cerebral CM located in an easily accessible noneloquent area may be considered for various reasons including prevention of future hemorrhage, reduction of burden caused by associated psychological disability and/or expensive and time-consuming follow-up visits, facilitation of lifestyle or career decisions, or risk reduction for patients who need anticoagulation .\n【32】 Symptomatic lesions — In general, acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) due to a CM is evaluated and managed in the same way as ICH from other causes.   \"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis\" and  \"Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Acute treatment and prognosis\".)\n【33】 A  of the general approach to symptomatic CMs according to presentation is as follows :\n【34】 Indications for surgical resection of accessible symptomatic cerebral and cerebellar lesions include progressive neurologic deficit, intractable epilepsy, and recurrent hemorrhage.\n【35】 Risk of new or recurrent hemorrhage — Decisions about CM management should be guided by risk estimates of new or recurrent CM-related symptoms.\n【36】 A 2016 meta-analysis of individual data from 1620 patients with cerebral CMs reported the clinical course from CM diagnosis to the first CM treatment or last available follow-up. With a median follow-up of 3.5 years, symptomatic ICH developed in 204 patients, with an estimated five-year risk of 15.8 percent (95% CI 13.7-17.9) . Presentation with ICH and brainstem location appear to be risk factors for subsequent hemorrhage . According to the meta-analysis, the estimated five-year risk of ICH in these risk categories are:\n【37】 There was no independent prognostic significance for risk related to age, sex, or CM multiplicity .\n【38】 It is uncertain if the presence of a DVA is a risk factor for future hemorrhage. Retrospective studies have suggested that an associated DVA is a risk factor for hemorrhage at presentation . However, in one registry of 731 patients with sporadic cerebral CM, associated DVAs were negatively correlated with initial ICH (odds ratio [OR] 0.635, 95% CI 0.459-0.878) and were also not predictive of subsequent hemorrhage .\n【39】 Efficacy of surgery — There are no randomized controlled trials of interventions for CMs, but observational data from uncontrolled case series suggest that surgical resection is beneficial for select patients with CMs. A 2022 systematic review and meta-analysis identified 100 cohorts with nearly 9000 patients who had treatment of cerebral CMs . With a mean follow-up of 4 years, the mean hemorrhage rate was lower for patients who underwent surgery (2.6 percent) compared with those treated with radiosurgery or conservative treatment (14 and 22 percent, respectively). Prior hemorrhage and brainstem location were associated with higher bleeding risk in both nonsurgical patients and those treated with surgery or radiosurgery.\n【40】 In an earlier systematic review involving over 3400 patients with CM, the incidence of the composite outcome (death, nonfatal intracranial hemorrhage, or new/worse persistent focal neurological deficit) after neurosurgical resection was 6.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI 5.7-7.5) . The incidence increased with each percentage point increase in patients with brainstem CMs (rate ratio [RR] 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05) and decreased with each percentage point increase in patients who presented with hemorrhage (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.96-1.00) and with each more recent study midyear, defined as the middle of the time frame of the year in which treatment took place (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85-0.98).\n【41】 Thus, although direct comparisons are lacking and data are observational, indirect comparisons suggest that the overall risks at approximately three years of surgical excision (approximately 7 percent risk of death, nonfatal stroke, or neurologic deficit) compares favorably to the overall estimated five-year ICH recurrence risk, which in one cohort was as high as 29.5 percent .\n【42】 The inherent risks of surgery are higher with CMs removed from eloquent ares of the brain (ie, brain regions that directly control neurologic functions such as language, vision, movement, or sensation) or deep brain regions, particularly with brainstem lesions. In a 2019 systematic review of surgical resection of brainstem CMs involving 2493 adult and pediatric patients, the rate of early postoperative morbidity was 35 percent; at last follow-up, neurologic function was improved in 58 percent, stable in 26 percent, and worse in 12 percent, with a mortality rate of approximately 2 percent . Therefore, surgery is typically reserved for patients with a second symptomatic hemorrhage involving brainstem or deep CMs, whereas surgery is usually recommended after a first symptomatic hemorrhage for CMs in noneloquent, superficial locations . However, due to their aggressive natural history, some experts advise treating brainstem CMs even in the absence of recurrent hemorrhage when there is neurologic deterioration if the lesion is surgically accessible (ie, near the pial surface or via a noneloquent tissue corridor to the lesion) . Microsurgical techniques are also being used with success in some centers for patients with several hemorrhages or progression of symptoms .\n【43】 Role of stereotactic radiosurgery — We suggest not using stereotactic radiosurgery as the primary treatment for CMs. Stereotactic radiosurgery is a potential alternative to conservative therapy in patients with such surgically inaccessible lesions, and the available evidence suggests that it does lead to a reduction in hemorrhage, especially two years or more after radiosurgery . Nevertheless, high complication rates in available published series coupled with clinical experience has dissuaded many from using stereotactic radiosurgery for the treatment of CMs. In addition, there is concern that radiation exposure may promote the development of new CMs in familial cases .   \"Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery\".)\n【44】 As an example, one retrospective analysis of 95 patients with 98 lesions found that stereotactic radiosurgery was associated with a significant drop in the annualized hemorrhage rate from 17 to 5 percent after a two-year post-treatment latency period . However, at an average follow-up of 5.4 years, the incidence of permanent neurologic deficit and mortality was 16 and 3 percent, respectively, and these complications were attributed to radiation-induced injury. In addition, the combined effects of radiation-related injury and clinical progression of the lesion led to a significant decline in neurologic function during follow-up. In a 2019 systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 observational studies with 576 patients who had stereotactic radiosurgery for brainstem CMs, symptomatic adverse radiation effects developed in 7.3 percent, and permanent adverse radiation effects were noted in 2.2 percent . However, data regarding the long-term safety and adverse effects of stereotactic radiosurgery remain sparse .\n【45】 Management of epilepsy — Patients with a first seizure related to cerebral CM should be managed with medical therapy using antiseizure medication. In one prospective report of patients with a first CM-related seizure, the risk of developing epilepsy was 94 percent , warranting the diagnosis of probable epilepsy after a single seizure and supporting the use of antiseizure medication treatment .\n【46】 In contrast, prophylactic antiseizure medication treatment is not indicated for patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic CMs who do not have seizures .\n【47】 Medically refractory epilepsy is an indication for surgical resection . In a case series of 168 patients with symptomatic epilepsy attributed to CM, more than two-thirds of patients were seizure free at three years after surgery . Predictors for good outcome included mesiotemporal location, size <1.5 cm, and the absence of secondarily generalized seizures. Another series identified a long preoperative seizure history and poorer preoperative seizure control as unfavorable prognostic indicators .\n【48】 Epilepsy surgery is reviewed in greater detail separately.   \"Surgical treatment of epilepsy in adults\", section on 'Vascular malformations'.)\n【49】 Management during pregnancy — Observational data from several large series suggest that the risk of developing clinical symptoms due to cerebral CMs during pregnancy is similar to the baseline risk before pregnancy , but this view is not universally held .\n【50】 For patients with cerebral CMs who develop new focal neurologic deficit, acute severe headache, or worsening seizures during pregnancy, a brain MRI is indicated to determine if the symptoms are related to CMs or another intracranial etiology . The approach to managing a new CM-related brain hemorrhage during pregnancy should account for the additional risk that surgical intervention may have on the pregnancy and the unborn child, but otherwise is similar to that in the nonpregnant state .\n【51】 Females with epilepsy related to cerebral CMs should be evaluated and counseled, ideally before conception, about the risks associated with epilepsy during pregnancy. These include the potential for perinatal complications, seizure worsening, and adverse effects of antiseizure medications on the fetus and later development. These risks may be minimized by interventions before and during pregnancy, as reviewed elsewhere.   \"Risks associated with epilepsy during pregnancy and postpartum period\" and  \"Management of epilepsy during preconception, pregnancy, and the postpartum period\".)\n【52】 The mode of delivery should be dictated by obstetrical indications; most patients can have a normal vaginal delivery unless there is a recent intracranial hemorrhage or a precluding neurologic deficit .\n【53】 Safety of antithrombotic therapy — In contrast to conventional wisdom, the available data suggest that the bleeding risk associated with CMs is not increased with the use of antithrombotic or oral anticoagulant therapy . In a population-based cohort study of 300 prospectively identified people (age 16 years and older) in Scotland who were diagnosed with a cerebral CM, there were 61 who used antithrombotic therapy (including 10 who used anticoagulant therapy) . Compared with no antithrombotics, the use of antithrombotics was associated with a lower risk of subsequent intracranial hemorrhage or focal neurologic deficit (2 versus 12 percent; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.12, 95% CI 0.02-0.88). Similarly, in a meta-analysis performed by the same investigators of six studies, mainly retrospective, with over 1300 patients, antithrombotic therapy use was associated with a lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage (3 versus 14 percent; incidence rate ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.13-0.51). It is likely that the indication for antithrombotic therapy in the patients so treated was the prevention of arterial or venous occlusive disease, but individual patient data were not available; these results do not provide a rationale for treating CMs with antithrombotic therapy.\n【54】 Use of contraceptive and menopausal hormonal medications — Limited data suggest use of hormonal contraception or menopausal therapy is associated with an elevated risk of hemorrhage . In a multicenter cohort study of 722 female patients with CM, the incidence rate of symptomatic hemorrhage was elevated among patients using hormonal therapy (7.4 versus 5.1 per 100 person-years) . Mean follow-up was 3.3 years. Hormonal therapy included estrogen and/or progesterone and most patients were taking an oral agent. This elevated risk of hemorrhage was present among both patients <45 years old taking oral contraception (aHR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3-3.2) and those ≥45 years old taking menopausal therapy (aHR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.1). These data are limited by nonrandomized study design, relatively short-term follow-up, and heterogeneity of both hormonal therapy and CM features.\n【55】 The use of hormonal contraceptive or menopausal therapy in patients with CM should be individualized, after informed discussion of risks and benefits. Nonhormonal options may be preferred for patients with CM to reduce the risk of hemorrhage.\n【56】 DEVELOPMENTAL VENOUS ANOMALIES — Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are composed of a radially arranged configuration of medullary veins (\"caput medusae\") separated by normal brain parenchyma (most commonly white matter) . These small venous conduits empty into a dilated superficial or deep vein that drains normal brain. A stenosis is common on the collecting vein at the point of penetration into the draining dural sinus. Microscopically, the venous structures appear largely normal with rare degenerative changes consisting of thickening and hyalinization. The lesions are common in supratentorial regions of the brain, with a frontal lobe predominance, but may also be found in the cerebellum and basis pontis.\n【57】 DVAs most often are solitary, although multiple lesions have been described in association with other clinical syndromes (eg, the blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome) . DVAs also may occur concurrently with cavernous malformations (CMs) in 13 to 40 percent, as well as with other intracranial vascular malformations and with superficial venous malformations of the head and neck .\n【58】 Clinical presentation — DVAs are considered benign lesions, although they may uncommonly present with seizures, progressive neurologic deficits, and hemorrhage . Headache is the most common presenting complaint, followed by seizures and sensory-motor phenomena. However, a direct correlation between these symptoms and the DVA is uncertain .\n【59】 In a 10-year prospective clinical and MRI study involving 80 patients, a symptomatic hemorrhage rate of 0.34 percent per year was observed . In another study of 93 patients with 492 person-years of follow-up, no symptomatic hemorrhages occurred . The hemorrhages were usually minor, although fatal intracranial hemorrhages have been described .\n【60】 A retrospective case series reviewed the clinical presentations of 68 patients with imaging findings suggestive of DVAs whose symptoms could not be attributed to other pathologies . Cases with associated CMs were excluded. Two major pathophysiologic mechanisms were reported:\n【61】 Diagnosis — Cerebral angiography is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of DVAs, but they are usually identified with contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging modalities such as CT, MRI, and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) .\n【62】 Management — DVAs should be treated conservatively in the vast majority of cases, with associated symptoms such as headaches and seizures managed medically . Obliteration may be considered in the rare patient with hemorrhage or uncontrolled seizures associated with a DVA . However, surgical or endovascular obliteration is associated with a risk of venous infarction .\n【63】 In patients who undergo surgery, preoperative MRI with gadolinium is required to identify an associated cavernous malformation . Venous infarction has been reported with DVA resection ; thus, it is reasonable to simply evacuate the hematoma and leave the DVA in situ. Radiosurgical and endovascular techniques do not have a defined role in the management of these lesions.\n【64】 In rare patients who present with symptomatic thrombosis of a DVA, there is anecdotal support for considering the use of systematic anticoagulation .   \"Cerebral venous thrombosis: Treatment and prognosis\".)\n【65】 CAPILLARY TELANGIECTASIAS — Capillary telangiectasias are small lesions most commonly found in the pons, middle cerebellar peduncles, and cerebellar dentate nuclei. Multiple lesions are common.\n【66】 The lesions are composed of small, dilated capillaries devoid of smooth muscle or elastic fibers. The intervening brain is often normal; it may also demonstrate areas of microhemorrhage or gliosis. A common histopathological feature of these lesions is a dilated efferent system, probably representing a venous channel.\n【67】 An argument has been made for these lesions representing the early stage in the spectrum of development of cavernous malformations and other \"mixed\" vascular malformations . Although not proven, angiogenesis is believed to play a role in lesion evolution. Most telangiectasias represent an angiodysplastic phenomenon resulting from faulty embryogenesis of the vascular wall and have been associated with angiomatous phacomatoses such as Osler-Weber-Rendu (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia), Louis-Bar (ataxia-telangiectasia), and Wyburn-Mason (unilateral retinocephalic vascular malformation) syndromes .   \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome)\", section on 'Cerebral vascular abnormalities' and  \"Ataxia-telangiectasia\", section on 'Neuroimaging features'.)\n【68】 Clinical presentation — Capillary telangiectasias are usually clinically silent, found incidentally on neuroimaging studies or at postmortem examination. In a systematic review of 10 series and 203 patients with capillary telangiectasias, symptomatic cases accounted for 6 percent ; headache, nausea, and seizures have been described in patients with these lesions, although a causal relationship is unclear.\n【69】 Diagnosis — MRI with gadolinium contrast is the most sensitive imaging modality for the identification of brain capillary telangiectasias, but the lesions may be inconspicuous on precontrast MRI. Small lesions that are hypo- to isointense on T1-weighted sequences and iso- to slightly hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences with faint enhancement on postcontrast T1-weghted sequences are suggestive, although not diagnostic, of these lesions . Compared with other precontrast MRI sequences, sensitivity for the detection of capillary telangiectasias is increased with the use of gradient echo and especially with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) (image 9) .\n【70】 Telangiectasias can be identified in the late arterial/early capillary phase of angiography as a faint blush with an associated venous channel. Thus, these lesions can be distinguished from developmental venous anomalies that are visualized during the venous phase of the study.\n【71】 Management — Capillary telangiectasias are nonoperable lesions. Management is conservative, particularly since most lesions are asymptomatic.\n【72】 The routine care and additional screening for patients with capillary telangiectasias associated with other conditions are discussed separately.   \"Ataxia-telangiectasia\", section on 'Management' and  \"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): Routine care including screening for asymptomatic AVMs\" and  \"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT): Evaluation and therapy for specific vascular lesions\".)\n【73】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Stroke in adults\" and  \": Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome)\".)\n【74】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

JDM is characterized by symmetric, proximal muscle weakness and distinct rashes of heliotrope dermatitis and Gottron papules. It is primarily a capillary vasculopathy. Juvenile polymyositis (JPM) probably is not a single disorder but rather is a name given to forms of IIM (a subgroup of IIM) without skin disease.   \"Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults\".)\n【2】 The diagnosis of JDM and other IIM of childhood is reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of these disorders are discussed elsewhere.   \"Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations\" and  \"Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Treatment, complications, and prognosis\".)\n【3】 CLASSIFICATION AND DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA\n【4】 Criteria and scoring for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies — The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR; formerly known as European League Against Rheumatism)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) developed and validated revised classification and diagnostic criteria for adult and juvenile IIMs in 2017 (no points are given for age of onset <18 years of age)  . These criteria replace the longstanding Bohan and Peter classification schema and diagnostic criteria for the various forms of myositis, including JDM, that were proposed in 1975 .\n【5】 The EULAR/ACR criteria include four variables related to muscle weakness and three related to skin manifestations, as well as variables related to laboratory measurements and other clinical manifestations. Muscle biopsies are infrequently performed in children. Thus, the EULAR/ACR criteria have one scoring system if no muscle biopsy is available and a separate scoring system if the patient has had a muscle biopsy.\n【6】 The EULAR/ACR score in the absence of a muscle biopsy is interpreted as follows :\n【7】 Definite IIM – Score of ≥7.5; level of probability ≥90 percent\n【8】 Probable IIM – Score of ≥5.5 to <7.5; level of probability ≥55 to <90 percent\n【9】 Possible IIM – Score of 5.3 or 5.4; level of probability ≥50 to <55 percent\n【10】 Categories of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies — The categories of IIM include :\n【11】 Juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) – Pediatric patients who meet the criteria for IIM are classified as having JDM if they have objective, symmetric, proximal greater than distal, muscle weakness that is chronic and usually progressive and a heliotrope rash (reddish-purple rash on the upper eyelids with periorbital edema), Gottron papules (erythematous, papulosquamous eruption over the dorsal surfaces of the knuckles), and/or Gottron sign (flat, erythematous rash over the dorsal surfaces of the knuckles) .\n【12】 Amyopathic/hypomyopathic JDM – Patients with amyopathic/hypomyopathic JDM lack clinically evident weakness but have the characteristic JDM cutaneous findings.\n【13】 Adermatitic JDM – Patients with this rare form of JDM lack skin findings but have the same muscle pathology as patients with JDM.\n【14】 Other IIM without skin findings – This category includes patients labeled as juvenile polymyositis (JPM). However, as the diagnostic tools become more sophisticated (eg, biopsies that demonstrate inflammatory dystrophies or autoantibodies that are markers of particular types of myositis such as anti-signal recognition particle [SRP] or anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase [HMGCR] for immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy [IMNM]), fewer patients are diagnosed with JPM, calling into question whether JPM is a specific entity. JPM probably is not a single disorder but rather is a name given to IIM without skin disease. IMNM seems to account for the cases previously labeled JPM .\n【15】 Other forms of juvenile myositis in the differential diagnosis are discussed below.  'Other forms of myositis' below.)\n【16】 DIAGNOSIS\n【17】 When to suspect — JDM is suspected if there is both chronic, progressive muscle weakness that is symmetric (eg, both upper extremities or both lower extremities) and affects proximal muscles more than distal and/or characteristic cutaneous findings, including heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, and nailfold capillary abnormalities\n【18】 Our diagnostic approach — The diagnosis of JDM and other forms of IIM is primarily a clinical one :\n【19】 Initial evaluation in all patients – All patients with suspected JDM or other IIM are examined for the characteristic cutaneous findings of JDM, including the rashes and nailfold capillary changes, and muscle strength testing is performed to evaluate for symmetric proximal muscle weakness. The diagnosis of JDM is suspected if cutaneous findings and weakness are present, amyopathic/hypomyopathic JDM if rash is present but weakness is absent, and adermatitic JDM or other IIM if weakness is present but cutaneous manifestations are absent.   \"Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations\", section on 'Muscle weakness' and  \"Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations\", section on 'Cutaneous manifestations' and 'Muscle strength testing' below and 'Nailfold capillaroscopy' below.)\n【20】 Patients whose muscle weakness is not typical of an IIM and who lack characteristic cutaneous findings should be evaluated for other myopathic disease or disorders due to denervation or neuropathy.  'Differential diagnosis' below.)\n【21】 Subsequent testing – The ensuing testing depends upon the IIM suspected after the initial evaluation:\n【22】 Patients with unusual clinical features or in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain – In these patients, we perform a muscle biopsy. Atypical clinical features include absence of rash, normal nailfold capillaries, and responses indicating lactic acidosis with exercise suggesting metabolic disease.  'Muscle biopsy' below.)\n【23】 Electromyography (EMG) is a classically used test, but we almost never use it anymore because of its painful, invasive nature and availability of other diagnostic testing.  'Electromyography' below.)\n【24】 Specific tests — Elevation of muscle enzymes and STIR (fat-suppressed, T2-weighted) MRI are indicative of muscle edema and inflammation. A muscle biopsy may be used to confirm the diagnosis whenever the clinical evaluation and initial laboratory testing are inconclusive.  'Our diagnostic approach' above.)\n【25】 Test performed in all patients with suspected JDM/IIM — Tests used to make the diagnosis of JDM/IIM in all patients include muscle strength testing and nailfold capillaroscopy.  'Our diagnostic approach' above.)\n【26】 Muscle strength testing — Testing of weakness is essential in assessing any child with suspected JDM or other IIM because symmetric proximal muscle weakness is a diagnostic requirement . Any decrement in proximal muscle strength is considered a positive finding. Distal muscles are often weak in JDM and other IIM, but distal muscle weakness in the absence of proximal muscle weakness should prompt suspicion of other diagnoses.\n【27】 A standardized confrontational (manual) muscle strength testing score of eight muscle groups, the MMT8, has been validated for use in assessing strength in JDM  and is also used in assessing patients suspected of having another form of IIM. Tested muscles comprise the deltoid, biceps, wrist extensors, quadriceps, ankle dorsiflexors, neck flexors, gluteus medius, and gluteus maximus . For the MMT8, muscle strength is scored on a 0 to 10 point scale (Kendall scale)  .\n【28】 The Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale (CMAS) is a clinical assessment tool that provides an objective measure of muscle strength  level, with excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability .\n【29】 Nailfold capillaroscopy — Abnormalities in nailfold capillaroscopy suggest an underlying connective tissue disease such as JDM, mixed connective tissue disease, or scleroderma (systemic sclerosis). Nailfold capillaroscopy is easily performed at the bedside or in clinic. A drop of oil or water-soluble gel is placed on the patient's fingernail bed, and a light microscope, dermatoscope, otoscope, or ophthalmoscope (set on the highest level of magnification) is used to assess nailfold capillary dilatation, tortuosity, dropout (loss of capillary loops), and the total number of capillaries per millimeter  .\n【30】 In one study, nailfold capillary microscopy demonstrated a lower density of capillaries (4.9 versus 6.9 capillaries per millimeter) and increased capillary width in 18 children with connective tissue disease, including 8 with JDM, compared with 17 healthy control children .\n【31】 In another study of 84 children with a variety of rheumatologic disorders and 34 healthy controls, nailfold capillaroscopy demonstrated significant dropout and dilatation of nailfold capillaries in patients with childhood dermatomyositis or scleroderma compared with children with other rheumatologic diseases and controls . Of the 25 patients with JDM for whom muscle biopsies were available, there was good correlation between the severity and number of vascular abnormalities on biopsy (eg, nonnecrotizing vasculitis or significant loss of capillary bed) and an increased likelihood of having nailfold capillaroscopic abnormalities.\n【32】 In patients with JDM, abnormal nailfold capillaroscopy correlated with increased skin involvement, but not muscle weakness, in several studies . However, in one study, loss of nailfold capillary density correlated with both muscle weakness and skin disease activity over time . The likelihood of nailfold changes increases with the duration of untreated disease .\n【33】 Tests performed in selected patients — Muscle enzyme levels, MRI, antibody testing, and muscle biopsy are performed in select patients.  'Our diagnostic approach' above.)\n【34】 Measurement of muscle enzymes — The muscle enzymes routinely tested in the evaluation of myopathy include:\n【35】 Creatine kinase (CK)\n【36】 Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)\n【37】 Aldolase\n【38】 Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)\n【39】 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)\n【40】 Elevated serum muscle enzyme levels are markers for muscle damage and, when present, support the diagnosis of JDM or other IIM. However, these enzymes may arise from sources other than muscle, even in patients with muscle weakness. In addition, normal levels do not exclude these diagnoses.\n【41】 Although the majority of children with JDM or other IIM will have serum elevation of one or more of these enzymes, some patients may have normal values despite clinically evident weakness. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 166 patients with JDM that reported normal serum levels of CK, LDH, and aldolase in 26, 13, and 17 percent of patients, respectively . The muscle enzyme levels were more likely to be normal with prolonged disease duration prior to treatment, particularly beyond four months.\n【42】 Magnetic resonance imaging — MRI, specifically T2-weighted and fat-suppressed (eg, STIR) images, shows muscle inflammation as edema (bright spots). Thus, MRI, either full body or of the thigh and shoulder muscles, is increasingly used in the diagnosis of childhood inflammatory myopathy to avoid the morbidity of muscle biopsy and EMG . Whole-body MRI is also emerging as an important method of determining the extent of muscle disease and following patients with JDM and other IIM .\n【43】 Of 122 children with various stages of JDM evaluated in one study from the United Kingdom and Ireland, 78 of 102 patients (76 percent) who underwent MRI had abnormalities consistent with myositis . In this cohort, EMG was performed in only 8 percent of patients and muscle biopsy in 36 percent.\n【44】 Another study of 19 patients with JDM (15 with active and 4 with inactive disease) and 5 healthy controls evaluated the role of MRI in the diagnosis of JDM . All patients with clinically active disease had abnormal findings on MRI compared with none of the patients with inactive disease or controls. The abnormalities included increased signal intensity (on T2 or STIR images) of the affected muscle, perimuscular edema, enhanced chemical shift artifact, and increased signal intensity in subcutaneous fat. Higher muscle signal intensity on MRI correlated with decreased muscle strength. After therapy, signal intensity in the muscle returned to normal.\n【45】 MRI has also been used to detect flares in muscle disease when other studies were less helpful .\n【46】 Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a research tool that is not yet routinely available. It can detect irregularities in muscle function and metabolism in inflammatory myopathy. In a study of 13 children with JDM, MRS identified metabolic abnormalities in the quadriceps muscle of 10 patients with severe clinical weakness . Two patients who had resolution of clinical weakness on prednisone treatment had normal findings, as did one patient with amyopathic JDM.\n【47】 Muscle biopsy — For patients with unusual clinical features or in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain, we perform a muscle biopsy to further assess for muscle inflammation.\n【48】 The chosen site for muscle biopsy should have evidence of muscle inflammation demonstrated by physical exam or preferably MRI. Open biopsy of an area that is actively inflamed, but not atrophied, is preferred by many pathologists, but needle biopsy may suffice in the hands of an experienced team.\n【49】 The characteristic histologic findings of JDM include the following  :\n【50】 Perifascicular atrophy.\n【51】 Degeneration of type I and II muscle fibers.\n【52】 Regeneration of muscle fibers with associated basophilia.\n【53】 Centralization of nuclei in muscle fibers.\n【54】 Perivascular mononuclear infiltrate.\n【55】 Endothelial swelling and necrosis.\n【56】 Reduced capillary number.\n【57】 Tubuloreticular inclusions on electron microscopy.\n【58】 Overexpression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules (an early event that may occur in the absence of lymphocytic infiltration and muscle damage). MHC class I expression is a highly sensitive marker of inflammatory myopathy but, unfortunately, is of low specificity ; it likely represents a reactive change to damage, perhaps endoplasmic reticular stress.\n【59】 Possible poor prognostic features include capillary dropout (loss of capillary loops) and intimal changes in small arteries and arterioles that can lead to occlusion and muscle infarction . A muscle biopsy score to help determine the course of JDM is available .\n【60】 In JPM, as classically described, the muscle biopsy is different and often shows an inflammatory exudate consisting of mononuclear T cells, which accumulate in the endomysium and surround and invade muscle fibers . IMNM, the most common IIM without skin disease or nailfold capillary changes seen in our clinic, is a disorder that was probably labelled as JPM in the past; it is characterized by fiber necrosis, activation of macrophages, and a sparse inflammatory infiltrate .\n【61】 Antibody testing — MSAs may be helpful in making the diagnosis of JDM, although the sensitivity of any one MSA is low. MSA testing, though, is useful in patients with unusual clinical features or an unusual clinical course, such as patients without the characteristic rashes (suspected IMNM) or those with scleroderma overlap features. The utility of testing may increase in the future with the discovery of additional MSAs . MAAs often are indicative of overlap myositis (overlap with scleroderma, lupus, or arthritis, etc) when present.   \"Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations\", section on 'Immunologic mechanisms' and  \"Overview of and approach to the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies\", section on 'Myositis-specific autoantibodies'.)\n【62】 Electromyography — An EMG provides evidence of muscle inflammation, which supports a diagnosis of JDM or other IIM and helps to distinguish these disorders from muscle weakness caused by denervation (eg, due to motor neuron disease or myasthenia gravis) . However, it is an invasive and uncomfortable test. Thus, it is reserved for cases where the diagnosis is uncertain or other testing (eg, MRI) is not available.\n【63】 Other tests — Other blood tests are often performed in patients with suspected or established childhood inflammatory myopathy to assess for complications or disease activity. However, these studies are often not directly useful in establishing the diagnosis and are discussed in detail separately.   \"Juvenile dermatomyositis and polymyositis: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations\", section on 'Laboratory findings'.)\n【64】 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — The diagnosis of JDM is relatively straightforward in the presence of the characteristic rash and symmetric proximal muscle weakness. However, JDM and other IIM without cutaneous manifestations are often difficult to distinguish from other causes of muscle weakness (eg, other myopathic diseases or disorders due to denervation or neuropathy).\n【65】 Clinical features, such as the age at onset, the chronicity of the disorder, family history, and the predominant site of muscle involvement, are useful in differentiating JDM and other IIM from these disorders. In these cases, additional evaluation, including serum muscle enzyme levels, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electromyography (EMG), and muscle biopsy, is helpful in determining the etiology of muscle weakness.\n【66】 Noninflammatory myopathy — Causes of noninflammatory myopathies include the following:\n【67】 Muscular dystrophies are due to genetic causes and include Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. There is often a family history of other affected members. Patients with Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy are usually male because the locus for the affected gene, dystrophin, is the X chromosome. Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically presents at an earlier age than those with JDM and other IIM (2 to 3 years of age versus 5 to 10 years of age). Genetic testing is available to confirm the diagnosis of many of these genetic myopathies, including Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy.   \"Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: Clinical features and diagnosis\" and  \"Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis\".)\n【68】 Metabolic myopathies are due to underlying deficiencies of energy production in muscle. These disorders include carnitine deficiency syndromes, defects of fatty acid transport and beta-oxidation enzymes, myoadenylate deaminase deficiency, and mitochondrial defects. Clinical features that differentiate these disorders from JDM and other IIM include marked fatigue with exercise, lactic acidosis, and myoglobinuria. Specific biochemical and immunohistochemical testing of muscle tissue is necessary for the diagnosis of these disorders.   \"Approach to the metabolic myopathies\" and  \"Metabolic myopathies caused by disorders of lipid and purine metabolism\" and  \"Mitochondrial myopathies: Clinical features and diagnosis\".)\n【69】 Other forms of myositis — Myositis may be caused by viral infection or another rheumatologic disease .\n【70】 Viral infections (eg, influenza, coxsackie, and poliomyelitis) may cause acute and transient myositis. The history of a recent infection and the short, self-resolving clinical course distinguishes infectious myositis from JDM and other IIM. Viral myositis is often characterized by calf pain as opposed to the proximal muscle weakness seen in JDM and other IIM.\n【71】 Other rheumatologic diseases, such as systemic scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, mixed connective tissue disease, polyarteritis nodosum, and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, may have myositis as a clinical manifestation of the disease. Differentiation among these disorders, JDM, and other IIM is usually not difficult, because of the presence of characteristic clinical features of each disease, although overlap syndromes may occur.   \"Juvenile systemic sclerosis (scleroderma): Classification, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\" and  \"Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\" and  \"Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\" and  \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease\".)\n【72】 Disorders of denervation or neuropathy — Lesions of the brain, spinal cord, anterior horn cell, lower motor neuron, and the neuromuscular junction may present with muscle weakness. Additional evaluation, including normal muscle enzyme levels, lack of inflammatory changes on MRI, or absence of histologic findings characteristic of JDM or other IIM on muscle biopsy, can differentiate these disorders from JDM and other IIM.\n【73】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Dermatomyositis and polymyositis\".)\n【74】 Classification and diagnostic criteria for idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) – The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR; formerly known as European League Against Rheumatism)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for IIM, which contain juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) and other juvenile IIM, include four variables related to muscle weakness and three related to skin manifestations, as well as variables related to laboratory measurements and other clinical manifestations .\n【75】 Diagnosis of JDM and other IIM – The diagnosis of JDM and other IIM is primarily a clinical one, although specific testing helps confirm the diagnosis (algorithm 1). For most patients, this includes obtaining muscle enzyme levels and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), either full body or of the thigh and shoulder muscles.  'Our diagnostic approach' above.)\n【76】 Differential diagnosis – The diagnosis of JDM is relatively straightforward in the presence of the characteristic rash and symmetric proximal muscle weakness. However, JDM and other IIM without cutaneous manifestations are often difficult to distinguish from other causes of muscle weakness (eg, other myopathic diseases or disorders due to denervation or neuropathy). These include muscular dystrophies, metabolic myopathy, infectious myositis, myositis associated with other rheumatic diseases, and disorders of denervation or neuropathy. Clinical features and additional studies differentiate JDM and other IIM from these other disorders that present with muscle weakness.

Most adverse food reactions in adults are due to various forms of food intolerance, which are nonimmunologic reactions. This topic provides an overview of the most common forms of food allergies\n【2】 NONALLERGIC ADVERSE FOOD REACTIONS — Nonallergic adverse food reactions can arise from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastrointestinal infections, deficiency of digestive enzymes, disorders resulting from anatomic and neurologic abnormalities, metabolic diseases, toxin-mediated reactions, and a host of other processes  .\n【3】 Food intolerance — Food intolerance refers to difficulty digesting or metabolizing a particular food. Food intolerance disorders are a subset of all adverse food reactions and are reported by 15 to 20 percent of the population . Food intolerances are even more common among patients with irritable bowel syndrome and other functional gastrointestinal disorders, with 50 to 80 percent reporting consistent problems with certain foods .   \"Pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome\", section on 'Food sensitivity'.)\n【4】 Comparison with food allergy — Food intolerances are not immunologic allergies and do not carry the same risk, although patients may not appreciate this distinction. A simple way to explain the difference is that food intolerance generally involves the digestive system, the amount of food ingested is directly related to the severity of symptoms, and the food causes similar symptoms with each exposure. In contrast, food allergies involve the immune system, and with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food allergies, even tiny amounts of the food can cause severe reactions. Finally, IgE-mediated, food-allergic reactions are unpredictable and have the potential to progress to a serious or life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis.\n【5】 Clinical features of food intolerance — Clinical features of food intolerances traverse a spectrum of organ systems and vary among different disorders, although most involve prominent gastrointestinal symptoms. Excessive intestinal gas, bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea are common symptoms.\n【6】 Specific disorders — Examples of well-described food intolerances include:\n【7】 Unproven syndromes of food intolerance — There are other food intolerance syndromes that are not well-substantiated.\n【8】 DEFINITION OF FOOD ALLERGY — A food allergy may be defined as an adverse reaction to a food due to an abnormal immunologic response following exposure (usually ingestion) . The terms \"allergy\" and \"hypersensitivity\" are often used interchangeably in the literature, although the term \"allergy\" is preferred in this topic review.\n【9】 IMMEDIATE (IgE-MEDIATED) FOOD ALLERGY — IgE-mediated reactions are referred to as \"immediate\" because signs and symptoms typically develop rapidly after ingestion of the culprit food (ie, within seconds to minutes). Uncommonly, reactions up to two hours and beyond can also occur. The pathophysiology involves the sudden, widespread activation of mast cells and basophils, as reviewed separately.   \"Food-induced anaphylaxis\", section on 'IgE-mediated anaphylaxis'.)\n【10】 Epidemiology — Food allergy had previously been estimated to affect up to 5 percent of adults, compared with 8 percent of children . However, subsequent studies have documented higher rates in adults . In a cross-sectional survey of over 40,000 adults in the United States conducted between 2015 and 2016, the estimate of convincing food allergy was significantly higher, at 10.8 percent, with a self-reported prevalence of twice that . In this study, self-reported food allergy cases were deemed convincing if symptoms matched those of IgE-mediated reactions.\n【11】 Onset — Food allergies can develop at any age, although most first appear in childhood. In a retrospective chart review, approximately 15 percent of patients with an initial food allergy diagnosis developed the problem as an adult . The same study found that age at first reaction peaked during the early 30s, although there was a wide range, with initial onset as late as 86 years of age. Of note, older age was associated with a higher risk for severe reactions .\n【12】 Predisposing factors — There are several factors that may lead to the development of sensitization (ie, the formation of IgE to a specific substance) and subsequent food allergy in an adult, although in many cases, no predisposing exposures can be identified:\n【13】 Signs and symptoms — Combinations of the following signs and symptoms are typical: Pruritus; urticaria; flushing; swelling of the lips, face, or throat; nausea; vomiting; cramping; diarrhea; wheezing; lightheadedness; syncope; or hypotension\n【14】 Causative foods and allergens — Although any food can cause IgE-mediated allergy, a few foods cause most of these reactions. Fish/seafood and peanuts/tree nuts are the two food groups that cause the majority of adult food allergies, both of which are estimated to affect up to 2 percent of the United States population. The other foods that cause allergy in adults vary around the world, probably reflecting the prominence of that food in the diet.\n【15】 Common types of IgE-mediated food allergy — The most common types of IgE-mediated food allergy in adults are OAS and isolated allergies to fish/seafood or peanuts/tree nuts.\n【16】 Oral allergy syndrome — Oral allergy syndrome (OAS), or pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS or PFS), is the most common form of food allergy in adults, affecting up to 5 percent of the general population in some studies . It is a generally mild form of food allergy that is caused by contact of the mouth and throat with raw fruits and vegetables and sometimes nuts. The most frequent symptoms of OAS are itchiness or mild swelling of the mouth, face, lip, tongue, and throat, generally developing within minutes after eating raw fruits or vegetables. Cooked fruits and vegetables typically do not elicit the symptoms, and this is an important question in the clinical history. Tree nuts and peanuts (raw and cooked) can also cause isolated oral symptoms, although these foods can also cause more serious systemic reactions. It is appropriate to refer all nut reactions to an allergy specialist.  'Referral' below.)\n【17】 Seafood allergies — Of reported food allergy among adults, seafood (ie, fish, shellfish, and mollusks) allergy is the next most common, with an estimated prevalence of 1 to 2 percent both in the United States and internationally. One study suggested that 40 to 60 percent of seafood allergies developed in adulthood, rather than in childhood .\n【18】 Peanut and tree nut allergies — Peanuts and tree nuts are also commonly implicated in adults with food allergy, although in most cases, the nut allergy developed in childhood and persisted into adulthood, unlike the situation with seafood allergies. Because peanut and tree nut allergies can range from mild to severe and can be difficult to categorize, we suggest referring all nut-allergic patients to an allergy specialist for evaluation.  'Referral' below.)\n【19】 Cow's milk and 'dairy' allergies — Allergic reactions to cow's milk proteins in adults is complicated by lactose intolerance, which increases with age. However, recent large population-based phone survey data suggest that cow's milk allergy may be as common in adults as peanut allergy but less associated with severe reactions and less frequently physician-diagnosed .\n【20】 Uncommon types — There are several uncommon presentations of IgE-mediated food allergy, such as food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, delayed allergy to red meat, occupational food allergies, allergies related to latex allergy, and natto allergy (Japan).\n【21】 Food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis — Food-dependent, exercise-induced anaphylaxis is a form of food allergy in which the patient only develops symptoms when ingestion of the culprit food is followed within a few hours by exertion or exercise. Symptoms do not develop if the food is eaten at rest or if the patient exercises without first eating the food. Thus, the connection between the food and exertion may not be recognized for some time. In addition, the reactions are unpredictable, which further complicates recognition. Diagnosis can be difficult, because commercial skin test reagents and in vitro testing may not as reliably detect the underlying food allergy.   \"Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis\" and  \"Exercise-induced anaphylaxis: Management and prognosis\".)\n【22】 Occupational food allergy — Occupational food allergy most often develops in patients who work in food processing. Common causes include fish, shellfish, wheat, other grains, fruits, and vegetables. Patients may present with respiratory allergy (ie, asthma, allergic rhinitis), anaphylaxis , and/or contact urticaria . A history of symptoms occurring predominantly in the work environment is suggestive. Occupational asthma and rhinitis are discussed elsewhere.   \"Occupational asthma: Definitions, epidemiology, causes, and risk factors\", section on 'High-molecular-weight' and  \"Occupational rhinitis\", section on 'Immunologic occupational rhinitis'.)\n【23】 Food allergies related to latex allergy — Latex allergy peaked in the 1990s in the United States and Europe due to the introduction of \"universal precautions,\" then declined again as hospitals and other work environments switched to nonlatex alternatives. However, rates of latex glove use and associated latex allergy remain high in some countries and in certain occupations, such as health care workers, food handlers/restaurant workers, and housekeeping staff. Among patients with latex allergy, 30 to 50 percent of individuals who are allergic to latex show an associated hypersensitivity to some plant-derived foods, such as avocado, banana, kiwi, chestnut, peach, tomato, white potato, and bell pepper\n【24】 Delayed allergy to red meat — One unusual form of IgE-mediated food allergy is caused by sensitization to the allergen galactose-alpha-1,3-galactose (alpha-gal), which is present in tissues from most animals, with the exception of old world primates (and humans). This form of meat allergy is distinguished by a delayed onset, with symptoms appearing three to six hours after ingestion (sometimes in the middle of the night, if meat was eaten for dinner). The symptoms are otherwise typical of IgE-mediated reactions, such as urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis, sometimes with gastrointestinal symptoms or hypotension. Allergy due to sensitization to alpha-gal is described in an increasing number of countries, including the United States, Australia, Spain, Germany, Japan, and Sweden. Patients may become sensitized to alpha-gal through tick bites or exposure to the drug cetuximab, and the role of these factors is discussed elsewhere.   \"Allergy to meats\", section on 'Risk factors' and  \"Allergy to meats\", section on 'The role of ticks in red meat allergy'.)\n【25】 Natto allergy — Reports indicate that surfers in Japan with repeated jellyfish stings are at risk for development of food allergy to fermented soybeans (natto) . The suspected allergen in these cases is the protein poly-gamma-glutamic acid, and both immediate and delayed reactions have been described .\n【26】 Initial management — Initial management for patients with possible IgE-mediated food allergies includes assessing whether the patient requires an epinephrine autoinjector, counseling about avoidance of that food and potentially cross-reactive foods, obtaining initial laboratory tests, and referral to an allergy specialist for further evaluation and management.\n【27】 Assess the need for an epinephrine autoinjector — We suggest prescribing epinephrine to any patient who may have had an apparent anaphylactic event or an allergic reaction that caused difficulty breathing, throat tightness, or possible hypotension. Such patients should be equipped with two epinephrine autoinjectors, with instructions about how and when to use them.\n【28】 Counsel about avoidance — Patients should avoid the suspect food until further evaluated. In the case of both seafood and tree nut allergy, patients allergic to one food are often allergic to other related foods. Thus, until the patient can be evaluated by an allergy specialist, it is prudent to recommend avoidance of the related foods. One of the goals of an allergy evaluation is clarification of related foods that can be safely ingested.   \"Seafood allergies: Fish and shellfish\" and  \"Peanut, tree nut, and\n【29】 Referral — Any patient with suspected IgE-mediated food allergy should be referred to an allergy specialist if possible for definitive diagnosis and further management. A possible exception is the patient with clear clinical symptoms related to a single food and positive IgE immunoassays specific for that food who is content to avoid the culprit food in the future and has no unanswered questions.\n【30】 Overview of an allergy evaluation — A typical allergy evaluation begins with a detailed history of past reactions to identify likely culprit food and probable mechanism. This is generally done before any testing takes place to determine the pretest probability that will inform interpretation of the results. Testing for IgE-mediated food allergies can be performed with skin testing or in vitro immunoassays for IgE specific to the food in question. Skin testing is the preferred method of diagnosing food allergy in most cases, because it is usually more sensitive and the negative predictive value is high. Skin testing should be performed by allergy specialists. If skin testing or in vitro testing is inconclusive, a graded challenge may be performed.   \"Diagnostic evaluation of IgE-mediated food allergy\", section on 'Prick/puncture skin tests' and  \"Diagnostic evaluation of IgE-mediated food allergy\", section on 'Food challenges'.)\n【31】 Laboratory testing — The presence of food-specific IgE or a positive skin test to a food demonstrates that a patient is \"sensitized\" to that food and indicates possible allergy. The definitive diagnosis of an IgE-mediated food allergy requires both sensitization and a history of consistent signs and symptoms on exposure to that food. Sensitization alone is not sufficient to diagnose food allergy, because individuals can be sensitized to a food (which is not uncommon) without having clinical symptoms upon ingestion. For example, patients with respiratory allergy to dust mite may have positive serum IgE to shrimp or other shellfish (because the testing cannot differentiate between different allergens within these two phylogenetically-related organisms) but not have shrimp allergy. For this reason, searching for culprit foods with extensive panels of IgE immunoassays when the history is vague is rarely productive and can be misleading.\n【32】 Unvalidated forms of testing — There are several types of tests that are not validated in the diagnosis of any type of food allergy and should not be performed . Generalists can advise patients against pursuing these tests. These can include food-specific IgG and IgG4 tests, which typically yield multiple positive results and may represent a normal immune response to food . Other types of testing for food allergy that are not supported by scientifically-valid concepts include sublingual or intradermal provocation tests, tests of lymphocyte activation, kinesiology, cytotoxic tests, and electrodermal testing .   \"Diagnostic evaluation of IgE-mediated food allergy\", section on 'Unvalidated methods'.)\n【33】 OTHER TYPES OF FOOD ALLERGY — Eosinophilic esophagitis and food-protein induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) are non-IgE-mediated forms of food allergy. Cell-mediated contact dermatitis to food proteins (usually  is another form, although it is believed to be uncommon .\n【34】 Eosinophilic esophagitis — Eosinophilic esophagitis in adults typically affects atopic men in their 20s or 30s and appears to be increasing in prevalence. Signs and symptoms are limited to the upper gastrointestinal tract and include dysphagia (initially to solid foods), acid reflux that is refractory to antacids, food impaction, and central chest pain. Eosinophilic esophagitis should be considered in adults with a history of food impaction, with persistent dysphagia, or with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that fails to respond to medical therapy. The majority of patients have evidence of food allergen and aeroallergen sensitization. Referral to a gastroenterologist for endoscopy is indicated.   \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)\" and  \"Treatment of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)\".)\n【35】 Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome — Food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES) is a non-IgE-mediated food allergy that primarily presents in infancy and resolved by three to five years of age. However, it is occasionally reported in adults, in whom mollusks and shellfish can be culprit allergens . There are also case reports of FPIES caused by egg in adults . Symptoms usually begin two to four hours after ingestion and are limited to the gastrointestinal tract (ie, nausea, vomiting and nonbloody diarrhea). Episodes usually resolve in a matter of hours, and are often mistaken for food poisoning initially, until a pattern of reactions becomes apparent. It is appropriate to refer patients with suspected FPIES to an allergist, although there is no specific testing that confirms the diagnosis. Testing for IgE-mediated allergy may be performed to exclude immediate allergy. FPIES is managed with avoidance of the culprit food.   \"Seafood allergies: Fish and shellfish\", section on 'Gastrointestinal reactions'.)\n【36】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Food allergy\".)\n", "title": "成人食物不耐受和食物过敏的概述", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/food-intolerance-and-food-allergy-in-adults-an-overview?search=%E9%A3%9F%E7%89%A9%E5%8F%98%E6%80%81%E5%8F%8D%E5%BA%94%E6%88%96%E8%BF%87%E6%95%8F%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%B2&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:51", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:48:13"}

Mutations are found within the collagen genes COL5A1 and COL5A2 in approximately 90 percent of patients who are diagnosed clinically . Patients with COL5A2 may have more severe features . Approximately 50 percent of the patients diagnosed with cEDS appear to have a de novo mutation, and neither parent is affected . Germline mosaicism can occur . Type V collagen molecules, encoded by the genes in which the mutations reside, interact with type I collagen molecules during collagen fibrillogenesis. Type I collagen is an integral component of the connective tissue, forming skin, tendons, ligaments, bones, and the aorta . In addition, there are rare patients who have mutations within type I collagen (COL1A1) .\n【15】 Classical-like EDS – There are two forms: classical-like 1 (EDSCLL1) and classical-like 2 (EDSCLL2). EDSCLL1 is due to tenascin X deficiency (MIM #606408, resulting from a mutation in the TNXB gene), which appears to be inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion . Heterozygosity for tenascin X deficiency can be associated with mild features of disease, including joint hypermobility . EDSCLL2 is due to autosomal recessive mutations in AEBP1 (MIM #618000).\n【16】 Hypermobile EDS – In most patients with hypermobile EDS (hEDS; MIM #130020), inheritance appears to be autosomal dominant, but the underlying genetic abnormality is unknown and unmapped .\n【17】 Cardiac-valvular EDS – Cardiac-valvular EDS (cvEDS; MIM #225320) is a rare autosomal recessive condition that results from a mutation in the gene for type I collagen (COL1A2) . Biallelic mutations lead to COL1A2 nonsense-mediated messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) decay and absence of pro-alpha 2(I) collagen chains.\n【18】 Vascular EDS – Vascular EDS (vEDS; MIM #130050) is an autosomal dominant condition that results from mutations in type III procollagen; 50 percent of cases appear due to de novo mutations . Most of the mutations are in the COL3A1 gene, causing an altered procollagen, which results in a \"dominant negative effect.\" Since type III collagen consists of a homotrimer, an abnormality in half of the type III procollagen molecules will result in greater than half of the resultant type III collagen molecules being abnormal. Haploinsufficiency mutations that result in half of the normal production of type III procollagen are much rarer; individuals with this type of mutation may have a milder phenotype and may not be diagnosed unless genetic testing is performed because of an affected family member . Individuals who have missense mutations leading to substitution of glycine for a larger amino acid have a median age of 30 years of age for aortic/arterial pathology compared with a median age of 36 in individuals with other types of pathogenic variants .\n【19】 Kyphoscoliotic EDS – Kyphoscoliosis EDS type 1 (kEDS; MIM #225400) is an autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in PLOD1, which result in lysyl hydroxylase deficiency . Lysyl hydroxylase is a collagen-modifying enzyme that forms crosslinks between the collagen trimers, increasing the collagen strength. Kyphoscoliosis EDS Type 2 (MIM #614557) is caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in the FKBP14 gene .\n【20】 Arthrochalasia EDS – Arthrochalasia is an autosomal dominant form of EDS (MIM #130060) that is caused by a loss of exon 6 in either COL1A1 (EDS VIIA) or COL1A2 (EDS VIIB) resulting in structural defects in type I collagen . Exon 6 codes for the procollagen N-proteinase cleavage site, which enables the precursor procollagen of either the alpha-1 or alpha-2 chains of type I collagen to be modified into mature collagen. The result of mutations affecting this region is abnormal weak collagen.\n【21】 Dermatosparaxis EDS – Dermatosparaxis is a rare form of EDS (MIM #225410) that is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. It is due to mutations in the ADAMTS2 gene, which result in deficiency of procollagen I N-terminal peptidase .\n【22】 Passive dorsiflexion of the fifth finger >90 degrees with forearm flat\n【23】 Passive apposition of the thumb to the flexor aspect of the forearm\n【24】 Hyperextension of elbow >10 degrees\n【25】 Hyperextensibility of the knee >10 degrees\n【26】 Flexion of waist with palms on the floor (and with the knees fully extended)\n【27】 Clinical manifestations – Classical EDS (cEDS), the severity of which can vary, is the term used collectively for the conditions formerly referred to as EDS gravis (EDS I) and EDS mitis (EDS II) . EDS type I was characterized by more severe joint hypermobility and skin laxity than type II, but these two forms previously described as distinct types have subsequently been recognized as describing the range of findings along a continuum. The prevalence of cEDS has been estimated at approximately 1 in 20,000, but some patients with milder forms may go unrecognized, and the frequency may be higher .\n【28】 Both large and small joint hypermobility are typically  of the patients lacked evidence of joint hypermobility . Joint dislocations may be frequent and recurrent; joint subluxations of the shoulder, patella, and temporomandibular joints are often self-managed by the patient and may resolve spontaneously. Joint effusions sometimes occur, and patients can develop osteoarthritis. Skeletal abnormalities, including thoracolumbar scoliosis, may be seen in some patients.\n【29】 The characteristic skin findings include velvety (\"doughy\") hyperextensible and fragile skin, which extends easily and snaps back upon release but may split easily with trauma; abnormal wound healing, with delayed healing and widened atrophic scars; and increased bruisability. The upper eyelid may be everted easily (Metenier sign) due to hyperextensibility of the eyelid. Other skin features include piezogenic papules (fat herniations through fascia on sides of feet), molluscoid pseudotumors (bluish-gray to violaceous, spongy 1 to 2 cm nodules over easily traumatized bony areas such as the shin, forearm, and Achilles tendon, which represent herniations of subcutaneous fat through atrophic dermal scars), and subcutaneous spheroids (several mm diameter, hard, calcified, subcutaneous nodules due to fat necrosis) .\n【30】 Additional features include fatigue, development of hernias, cervical insufficiency, and uterine prolapse. Vascular complications are rare but have been reported, and valvular heart disease is uncommon. The frequency of aortic root dilatation has been reported as 6 percent . Mitral valve prolapse has been observed in 6 percent of patients as well   'Mitral valve prolapse' above). Carotid artery tortuosity has also been noted in approximately 19 percent of patients . Pulmonary complications, including spontaneous pneumothorax, are reported. Gastrointestinal and bladder diverticula may occur . Mild decreased bone density and vertebral abnormalities have been reported .\n【31】 Diagnosis – The diagnosis is made clinically, based upon the family history and physical examination. It can be made in the presence of the major criteria along with any minor criterion, or it can be made in the presence of the major skin criterion and either generalized joint hypermobility and/or three or more minor criteria :\n【32】 Classical-like 1 – Classical-like 1 (EDSCLL1) consists of joint hypermobility, joint subluxations, and hyperextensible velvety skin but with normal wound healing. Some patients can have myopathic features. A subset of patients with a contiguous gene defect including both TNXB and the CYP21A2 genes can have endocrinologic features with ambiguous genitalia, an elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone level, and genitourinary and cardiac valvular abnormalities . Gastrointestinal ruptures have been reported rarely .\n【33】 Classical-like 2 – Classical-like 2 (EDSCLL2) is similar to classical EDS, and the major features are joint and skin laxity, joint dislocations, abnormal wound healing with atrophic scars, mitral valve prolapse, aortic root dilation, and, rarely, bowel rupture .\n【34】 Clinical manifestations – The major physical features of hypermobile EDS (hEDS) include large- and small-joint and spine hypermobility; frequent joint dislocations, often affecting a shoulder, the patella, or the temporomandibular joint; and chronic joint pain, which often develops, may resemble fibromyalgia, and can have an adverse impact on the quality of life . Patients may also develop scoliosis and premature osteoarthritis. The frequency of the hypermobility form of EDS is unknown, although it is at least 1 in 5000 .\n【35】 The skin is sometimes soft and smooth, but usually not to the degree seen in cEDS, where it is typically described as velvety; only mild hyperextensibility is evident, if present. Wound healing is normal. Molluscum pseudotumors do not occur, unlike patients with classic EDS. Piezogenic papules may be seen. Keratosis pilaris/hyperkeratosis of the extensor surfaces and striae can occur . Skin changes are generally modest compared with classic EDS, but small, postsurgical, wide, nonpapyraceous scars can occur .\n【36】 Other features and complications include delayed gastric emptying and irritable bowel syndrome. Autonomic dysfunction, including postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), which can be detected by tilt table testing, can occur . Such patients may experience syncope, sleep disturbance including apnea, swelling and varicosities of legs, headache including \"brain fog,\" and poor proprioception . Autonomic instability can also be associated with postural acrocyanosis after several minutes of standing in some patients . One report has also suggested an association with occipitoatlantoaxial hypermobility and Chiari type I malformation . Headaches are reported in approximately one-third of patients (including migraines, tension-type headaches, headache from cerebrospinal fluid leakage, headache from Chiari malformation, and cervicogenic headache [from cervical spine hypermobility]) . Resistance to local anesthetic drugs and opioids has been reported.\n【37】 Mild aortic root dilatation can be\n【38】 The clinical syndrome of hEDS is discussed in detail separately.   \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and hypermobility spectrum disorder\".)\n【39】 Diagnosis – The diagnosis is made clinically. The 2017 international diagnostic criteria for hEDS have three criteria, all of which must be present:\n【40】 Clinical manifestations – Vascular EDS (vEDS) is potentially life-threatening and differs from the classic and hypermobility forms most dramatically in the increased risk for these patients of spontaneous vascular or visceral rupture and the absence of large-joint hyperextensibility. Small (more distal) joints, however, may exhibit mild hypermobility. The prevalence of the vascular form of EDS is not well studied, but estimates based upon available data suggest a frequency of at least 1 in 100,000, accounting for approximately 4 percent of all EDS cases .\n【41】 Arterial rupture may involve the iliac, mesenteric, cerebrovascular, splenic, or renal arteries or the aorta . Preexisting aneurysms are rarely detected prior to a rupture, as the aneurysms are typically pseudoaneurysms. Complications in affected individuals also include significant risk for spontaneous rupture of internal organs (such as the intestine and gravid uterus) and muscles. Maternal mortality during pregnancy is approximately 12 percent, although delivery is often uneventful .\n【42】 The skin is thin and may appear translucent with a prominent venous pattern (especially on the chest and abdomen), atrophic scars, increased bruisability, and varicosities. Wound dehiscence may occur postoperatively. However, the skin is only mildly hyperextensible. Minor trauma leads to extensive bruising.\n【43】 Skeletal abnormalities include acrogeria, characterized by a lack of subcutaneous fat in the distal extremities, and a particular facial appearance with prominent eyes, thin face and nose, and lobeless ears (not . Gingival recession is common. Short stature may be seen but is not typical. Clubfoot has been reported in 12 percent of neonates with vEDS, and 3 percent have congenital hip dislocations . Amniotic band sequence has been reported in affected individuals . Emphysema also has been observed on imaging .\n【44】 Eighty percent of individuals experience a major vascular event or rupture of an internal organ by age 40 years. There is a shortened lifespan with a median age of death of 48 years .\n【45】 Diagnosis – The following criteria have been proposed :\n【46】 Clinical manifestations – Kyphoscoliotic EDS type 1 (kEDS) typically presents in newborns with muscle hypotonia associated with joint laxity, often leading to an initial evaluation by a neurologist . Kyphoscoliosis may be present at birth and develops in nearly all patients. Progressive kyphoscoliosis can result in respiratory complications and often requires surgery. Patients with this form exhibit joint hypermobility and can experience recurrent joint dislocations. Osteoporosis can be seen, and clubfoot deformity may occur in approximately 30 percent. The skin is hyperextensible and typically velvety, pale, and translucent, with poor wound healing. Approximately 50 percent may have atrophic scarring and 50 percent may have severe bruising . Vascular fragility may be present and spontaneous vascular rupture may occur.\n【47】 Ocular involvement may occur, including the presence of scleral fragility, risk of rupture of ocular globe, keratoconus, retinal detachment, and glaucoma.\n【48】 The frequency is estimated at 1 in 100,000 .\n【49】 Kyphoscoliotic EDS type 2 is due to biallelic variants in FKBP14 . Individuals with this have progressive kyphoscoliosis, hypotonia, myopathic features, joint hypermobility, hernias, hyperelastic skin, and hearing loss .\n【50】 Diagnosis – The following criteria have been proposed :\n【51】 Clinical diagnosis is based on the presence of congenital hypotonia and early-onset kyphoscoliosis along with the joint laxity and/or three minor criteria. Diagnostic testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis:\n【52】 Clinical manifestations – Arthrochalasia EDS (aEDS) is characterized by hypermobility with recurrent subluxations, congenital bilateral hip dislocations, extremity contractures, thoracolumbar scoliosis, short stature (as a complication of the scoliosis), muscle hypotonia, and frequent fractures . Complications include fractures and recurrent dislocations, which can prevent weightbearing. The skin is fragile and hyperelastic and may have a doughy texture. Its frequency is unknown, although this form is extremely rare.\n【53】 Diagnosis – The diagnosis is made clinically based upon a combination of the congenital hip dislocations along with the severe generalized joint hypermobility with recurrent dislocations and/or hyperextensible skin and a combination of the other clinical features noted .\n【54】 Clinical manifestations – Features of dermatosparaxis EDS (dEDS) include severe skin fragility, sagging redundant skin, and large hernias . Blue sclerae, typical facial features, and severe bruising can be present. The major complications are related to the severe skin fragility. The skin can have a velvety \"doughy\" texture. Its frequency is unknown.\n【55】 Diagnosis – The diagnosis is made by the combination of the severe skin fragility along with the typical facial features and other features, along with sequencing of the ADAMTS2 gene.\n【56】 Spondylodysplastic EDS (spEDS) – Clinical features of this form include short stature; blue sclera; delayed eruption of teeth and hypodontia; joint laxity and a particular pattern of skeletal findings (platyspondyly, osteopenia, widened metaphyses, flattened epiphyses, small ilia, short broad femoral necks and short metacarpals and phalanges); velvety, hyperextensible, thin skin with prominent veins; and delayed wound healing with atrophic scars . Keratoconus, cardiac involvement, and vascular events have also been reported . One report has suggested that the extreme hypermobility of the distal joints and the very soft skin on the hands and feet can be clues to the diagnosis . Laboratory testing in these patients demonstrates that the ratio of lysyl pyridinoline to hydroxylysyl pyridinoline in urine is elevated compared with normal (approximately 0.9 in patients versus 0.2 in normals), but the degree of elevation is not as high as . DNA sequencing of the SLC39A13, B4GALT7, and B3GALT6 genes are available.\n【57】 Musculocontractural EDS (mcEDS) – Clinical features of this form include specific craniofacial features (broad forehead, small mouth, large fontanelle and micrognathia in infancy; protruding jaw in adolescence; low-set prominent rotated ears, blue sclerae, short nose, thin upper lip, and long philtrum), thumb and finger contractures, club feet, severe kyphoscoliosis, hypotonia, hyperextensible thin skin with easy bruising, atrophic scars, joint laxity, subcutaneous hematoma, and organ fragility . DNA sequencing of the CHST14 and DSE genes can be performed. Individuals with mcEDS due to the DSE gene may have a milder phenotype .\n【58】 Periodontal EDS (pEDS) – This form of EDS is characterized by early severe periodontitis, easy bruising, pretibial plaques, and joint hypermobility. It is due to pathogenic variants in C1r and C1s (MIM 130080 and MIM 617174, respectively). One study demonstrated that activation of the complement cascade in this condition can occur independently of triggers by microbial organisms . Vascular complications can occur rarely, including arterial complications, venous insufficiency, and aneurysm development .\n【59】 Brittle cornea syndrome (BCS) – BCS is characterized by corneal fragility, corneal rupture, blue sclerae, keratoconus, myopia, and joint hypermobility. Additional features can include hearing loss, hand and foot deformities, kyphoscoliosis, hip dysplasia, and bone fragility .\n【60】 Myopathic EDS (mEDS) – Myopathic (m)EDS can be autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive due to variants in COL12A1 (the gene for type XII collagen). The features include hypotonia, decreased muscle mass, proximal joint contractures, joint hypermobility, skin involvement including atrophic scarring, delay in gross motor milestones, and evidence of myopathy on muscle biopsy. Some individuals will have increased levels of serum creatine kinase .\n【61】 Basics topics   \"\n【62】 Overview – Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is the term used for a group of relatively rare disorders of connective tissue, due to inherited alterations in genes affecting the synthesis and processing of different forms of collagen. These conditions are characterized by one or another of several features, including skin hyperextensibility, joint hypermobility, and tissue fragility. The disorders are classified into 13 major types, which can be distinguished from one another clinically, and genetic testing may be useful diagnostically for several of these disorders\n【63】 When to suspect EDS – EDS should be suspected when a patient presents with some combination of characteristic features, including joint hypermobility, multiple joint dislocations, translucent skin, poor wound healing, easy bruising, hyperextensible skin, and unusual scars; and in any individual who experiences spontaneous rupture of an organ or dissection of a blood vessel. Joint dislocations or subluxations are common in most forms of EDS, and joint pain and premature degenerative arthritis are often consequences of the disorder. Other common features include pes planus, pectus excavatum, and a high arched palate. Musculoskeletal pain is common in patients with joint hypermobility.  'Overview' above and 'Definitions' above.)\n【64】 Classical EDS – Classical EDS (cEDS), the severity of which can vary, is characterized by skin hyperextensibility; widened atrophic scars; and both large- and small-joint hypermobility, which may decrease with age. Frequent and recurrent joint dislocations are common, osteoarthritis can develop, and scoliosis may be  hyperextensible and fragile skin, which extends easily and snaps back upon release, but may split easily with trauma; abnormal wound healing, with delayed healing and widened atrophic scars; and increased bruisability. Additional features include fatigue, development of hernias, cervical insufficiency and uterine prolapse, and rare vascular complications. Valvular heart disease is uncommon. The diagnosis can be confirmed by DNA sequencing of COL5A1 and COL5A2.  'Classical or classic EDS' above.)\n【65】 Hypermobility EDS – The major features of hypermobility EDS (hEDS) include large- and small-joint and spine hypermobility, which may lessen with age, and frequent joint dislocations. Chronic joint pain, which may resemble fibromyalgia, is common. Patients may also develop scoliosis and premature osteoarthritis. Skin is sometimes soft and smooth, but usually not to the degree\n【66】 Vascular EDS – Vascular EDS (vEDS) is potentially life-threatening and is characterized by increased risk of spontaneous vascular or visceral rupture and the absence of large-joint hyperextensibility. Arterial rupture may involve the iliac, mesenteric, cerebrovascular, splenic, or renal arteries or the aorta. Preexisting aneurysms are rarely detected prior to a rupture, as the aneurysms are typically pseudoaneurysms. There is significant risk for spontaneous rupture of internal organs (such as the intestine and gravid uterus) and muscles, and increased risk of maternal mortality during pregnancy. The skin is thin and may appear translucent with a prominent venous pattern, atrophic scars, increased bruisability, and varicosities, but is only mildly hyperextensible. Skeletal abnormalities may also be present. Substantial morbidity and mortality occurs by the fifth decade of life. The diagnosis can usually be confirmed by sequence and deletion/duplication testing of the COL3A1 gene.  'Vascular EDS' above.)\n【67】 Other forms of EDS – Additional forms of EDS include kyphoscoliotic (kEDS), in which ocular involvement may be present, in addition to muscle hypotonia and joint laxity present at birth, kyphoscoliosis detected during infancy and other skeletal changes, and abnormal skin; arthrochalasia (aEDS), which is characterized by hypermobility with recurrent subluxations, congenital hip dislocations, extremity contractures, thoracolumbar scoliosis, short stature, muscle hypotonia, and frequent fractures; dermatosparaxis (dEDS), with severe skin fragility, sagging redundant skin, and large hernias; and other rare forms\n【68】 Differential diagnosis – The differential diagnosis of each form of EDS includes the other EDS types and other connective tissue disorders with shared features, including Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, and several other uncommon or rare disorders that can usually be distinguished clinically from EDS. Whether hypermobile EDS (hEDS) and joint hypermobility syndrome represent distinct entities or the same condition remains uncertain.  'Differential diagnosis' above.)\n【69】 Indications for referral – Patients suspected of having EDS based upon their clinical presentation and family history should be referred for consultation with an expert in clinical genetics or the care of patients with EDS for confirmation of the diagnosis and the institution of multidisciplinary management and follow-up care. The geneticist or other EDS expert can help to determine which, if any, genetic testing may be needed to assist in making or confirming the diagnosis.

A child with constipation may have bowel movements less frequently than normal, or their bowel movements may be hard, large-caliber, or difficult and painful to pass.\n【2】 NORMAL VERSUS ABNORMAL BOWEL HABITS — The \"normal\" amount of time between bowel movements in infants or children depends upon their age and what they eat. The look of the bowel movement can also vary.\n【3】 Normal bowel habits\n【4】 During the first week of life, infants pass approximately four soft or liquid bowel movements per day. Infants who are breastfed generally have more bowel movements than those who are formula-fed.   \"\n【5】 During the first three months of life, breastfed infants have approximately three soft bowel movements per day. Some breastfed infants have a bowel movement after each feeding, whereas others have only one bowel movement per week. Infants who breastfeed are rarely constipated.   \"\n【6】 Most formula-fed infants have two to three bowel movements per day, although this depends on which formula is given. Some soy- and cow's milk-based formulas cause harder bowel movements, while formulas that contain partially or completely hydrolyzed milk proteins (sometimes known as \"hypoallergenic\" formulas), which may be recommended for infants with an allergy or sensitivity to cow's milk, can cause loose bowel movements.\n【7】 By two years of age, a child typically has one to two formed (firm but not hard) bowel movements per day.\n【8】 By four years of age, a child usually has one or two formed bowel movements per day.\n【9】 Abnormal bowel habits\n【10】 An infant who is constipated typically has bowel movements that look hard or pellet-like. The infant may cry while trying to move their bowels. The infant may have bowel movements less frequently than they used to, for example, having a bowel movement every one to two days rather than the previous normal of three to four per day.\n【11】 You may be worried that your infant is constipated if they seem to be straining during a bowel movement, causing their face to temporarily turn red. In most cases, this happens because young infants are not able to coordinate muscle movements when having a bowel movement. You can help by gently bending your infant's hips and legs up toward the abdomen. This helps to relax the muscles in the pelvis, releasing the bowel movement. The infant probably is not constipated if they pass a soft bowel movement within a few minutes of straining.\n【12】 If your child has fewer bowel movements than usual or complains of pain during a bowel movement, they may be constipated. For example, a child who normally has one to two bowel movements every day may be constipated if they have not had a bowel movement in two days.\n【13】 A child who normally has a bowel movement every two days is not constipated, as long as the bowel movement is reasonably soft and is not difficult or painful to pass.\n【14】 Many children with constipation develop unusual habits when they feel the urge to have a bowel movement.\n【15】 WHY CONSTIPATION DEVELOPS\n【16】 Pain — When the child does have a bowel movement, it can be painful and lead them to withhold (avoid going) in an effort to avoid more pain.\n【17】 Unfamiliar surroundings — Children may delay moving their bowels if they do not have a place where they feel comfortable having a bowel movement or if they are busy and ignore the need to use the toilet. This can happen when a child starts going to school and avoids having a bowel movement because they are worried about hygiene concerns or feel embarrassed to use the toilet at school.\n【18】 Medical problems — Medical problems cause constipation in less than 5 percent of all children. Underlying medical problems are even less likely in children who start to have constipation during one of the critical periods discussed below.  'Constipation and development' below.)\n【19】 CONSTIPATION AND DEVELOPMENT — Constipation is particularly common at three times in an infant's and child's life: after starting cereal and puréed foods, during toilet training, and after starting school. Parents can help by being aware of these high-risk times, working to prevent constipation, recognizing the problem if it develops, and acting quickly so that constipation does not become a bigger problem.\n【20】 Transition to solid diet — Infants who are transitioning from breast milk or formula to solid foods may experience constipation. An infant who develops constipation during this time can be treated with one of the measures described below.  'Infants' below.)\n【21】 Toilet training — Children are at risk for constipation during toilet training for several reasons   \"\n【22】 If a child is not ready or interested in using the toilet, they may try to avoid having a bowel movement (called withholding), which can lead to constipation.\n【23】 Children who have experienced a hard or painful bowel movement are even more likely to withhold, and this only worsens the problem.\n【24】 Some children get used to having a bowel movement while standing up (into a diaper or disposable pull-ups). It may be hard for them to get used to having a bowel movement when sitting on a toilet or potty chair.\n【25】 Sitting on an adult-size toilet can put the child in an awkward position that makes it harder to pass a bowel movement. You can help by providing a child toilet seat insert and foot support , or a potty seat.\n【26】 School entry — Once your child starts school, you may not be aware if they have problems going to the bathroom. Some children are reluctant to use the bathroom at school because it is unfamiliar or too \"public,\" and this can lead to withholding.\n【27】 HOME TREATMENTS FOR CONSTIPATION — You can try using home remedies first to relieve your child's constipation. These remedies should begin to work within 24 hours; if your child does not have a bowel movement with 24 hours or if you are worried, call your child's doctor or nurse for advice.\n【28】 Infants — If your child is younger than four months old, talk to a doctor or nurse about treatment of constipation. For infants of any age, contact the child's doctor if there are concerning signs or symptoms (such as severe pain or rectal bleeding) along with constipation.  'When to\n【29】 Fruit juice – If your infant is at least four months old, you can give certain fruit juices to treat constipation. This includes prune, apple, or pear juice (other juices are not as helpful). You can give a total of 2 to 3 ounces (60 to 120 mL) of 100 percent fruit juice per day for children four to eight months old. You can give up to 6 ounces (180 mL) of fruit juice per day to infants 8 and 12 months old. However, do not give juice every day for more than a week or two. Too much juice can be unhealthy for children's overall diet and growth.\n【30】 Dark corn syrup – Dark corn syrup has been a folk remedy for constipation for hundreds of years. Dark corn syrup contains complex sugar proteins that keep water in the bowel movement. However, current types of dark corn syrup may not contain these sugar proteins, so the syrup may not be helpful. It is not clear whether light corn syrup is helpful.\n【31】 High-fiber foods – If your infant has started eating solid foods, you can substitute barley cereal for rice cereal. You can also offer other high-fiber fruits and vegetables (or purées), including apricots, sweet potatoes, pears, prunes, peaches, plums, beans, peas, broccoli, or spinach. You can mix fruit juice (apple, prune, pear) with cereal or the fruit/vegetable purée.\n【32】 Formulas with iron – The iron in infant formula does not cause or worsen constipation, because the dose of iron is very small. Therefore, changing to a low-iron formula is not recommended, because this will not help with the constipation. Your doctor or nurse may recommend a different type of formula; consult them before making any formula changes.\n【33】 Iron drops contain higher amounts of iron and may sometimes cause constipation. Therefore, infants who need iron drops sometimes also need extra diet changes or treatments to make sure that they do not get constipated.\n【34】 Children — If your child has been constipated for a short time, changing what they eat may be the only treatment needed. You can make these changes as often as needed so that the child has soft and painless bowel movements.\n【35】 Dietary recommendations\n【36】 Fruit juice – Certain fruit juices can help to soften bowel movements. These include prune, apple, or pear (other juices are not as helpful). Do not give more than 4 to 6 ounces (120 to 180 mL) of 100 percent fruit juice per day to children between one and six years of age; children older than seven years may drink up to two 4-ounce (120 mL) servings per day.\n【37】 Fluids – It is not necessary to drink large amounts of fluid to treat constipation, although it is reasonable to be sure that the child drinks enough fluid. For children older than one year, enough fluid is defined as 32 ounces (960 mL) or more of water or other non-milk liquids per day. It is not helpful for the child to drink more than this if they are not thirsty.\n【38】 Food recommendations – Offer your child a well-balanced diet, including whole-grain foods, fruits, and vegetables .\n【39】 Praise your child for trying these foods and encourage them to eat these foods more frequently, but do not force these foods if your child is unwilling to eat them. You should offer a new food 8 to 10 times before giving up. You may want to avoid giving (or give smaller amounts of) certain foods while your child is constipated, including cow's milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream.\n【40】 A fiber supplement may be recommended for some children. Fiber supplements are available in several forms, including wafers, chewable tablets, or powdered fiber that can be mixed in juice (or frozen into popsicles).\n【41】 Milk – Some children develop constipation because they are unable to tolerate the protein in cow's milk. If other treatments for constipation are not helpful, try having the child avoid all cow's milk (and milk products) for at least two weeks. If your child's constipation does not improve during this time, you can begin giving cow's milk again. If you see blood in your child's bowel movement, check with your doctor or nurse.\n【42】 If the child does not drink milk for a long time, ask your child's doctor or nurse for suggestions about ways to be sure that they get enough calcium and vitamin D.\n【43】 Approach to toilet training — If your child develops constipation while learning to use the toilet, stop toilet training temporarily. It is reasonable to wait two to three months before restarting toilet training. When you resume, encourage your child to sit on the toilet or potty as soon as they feel the urge to have a bowel movement and give positive reinforcement (a hug, kiss, or words of encouragement) for trying, whether or not the child is successful. Avoid punishing or pressuring your child.\n【44】 Encouraging healthy toilet habits — If your child is toilet trained, encourage them to sit on the toilet for approximately 10 minutes once or twice a day after eating. The child is more likely to have a bowel movement after a meal, especially breakfast. Reward the child with praise or attention for sitting, even if they do not have a bowel movement.\n【45】 MEDICAL EVALUATION OF CONSTIPATION — Some infants and children have concerning symptoms with constipation or have constipation that does not improve with home treatments. In these situations, your child should see a doctor or nurse. If you are worried or not sure whether your child should be evaluated, ask their doctor or nurse for advice.\n【46】 RECURRENT CONSTIPATION — If your infant or child has repeated episodes of constipation (called recurrent constipation), work with your child's doctor or nurse to figure out why this is happening. Some children with chronic and recurrent constipation can develop a problem with bowel leakage (called fecal incontinence), in which liquid stool leaks around the large hard stool in the rectum. Because the leaking stool is soft, some parents can confuse this with diarrhea.\n【47】 Fear of pain due to hard stools or an anal fissure (a small tear in the anal opening). A child can withhold stool by willfully clinching their buttocks (butt cheeks), which sometimes looks like they are trying to push the stool out. Discussing this with the doctor or nurse can help you learn to tell whether your child is trying to withhold stool.\n【48】 Fear of using the bathroom away from home.\n【49】 Not having enough time to use the bathroom.\n【50】 Reducing the laxative dose or discontinuing laxative too soon.\n【51】 \"Clean out\" treatment — If your child has recurrent constipation, continue to follow the suggestions for home treatment above. Your child may also need a \"clean out\" treatment to help empty the bowels. This treatment may include a medicine (eg, polyethylene glycol [PEG; such as Miralax] or magnesium hydroxide [Milk of Magnesia]), an enema or rectal suppository (a pill that you insert in the child's rectum), or a combination of treatments. Consult your child's doctor or nurse before giving any of these treatments.\n【52】 Maintenance treatment — After the \"clean out\" treatment, most infants and children are treated with a laxative for several months or longer. PEG is often used for this purpose. You can adjust the amount of laxative so that the child has one soft bowel movement per day. Although several laxatives are available without a prescription, it is important to consult with your child's doctor or nurse before giving laxatives on a regular basis.\n【53】 Rescue treatment — It is possible for a child to retain a large bowel movement in the colon, despite using laxatives. Develop a \"rescue\" plan with your child's doctor or nurse in case this happens. If the child has not had a bowel movement for two to three days, a \"clean out\" treatment and an increased dose of the maintenance laxative are usually recommended.\n【54】 Behavior changes — In children who have constipation frequently, behavior changes are recommended to help the child develop normal bowel habits.\n【55】 Encourage your child to sit on the toilet within 30 minutes after each meal (ie, for 10 minutes two to three times per day). Do this every day if possible.\n【56】 Design a reward system with your child to recognize the child's efforts. Give the reward after the child sits, even if they do not have a bowel movement. Rewards for preschoolers may include stickers or small sweets, reading books, singing songs while sitting, or special toys that are only used during toilet sitting. Rewards for school-aged children may include reading books together, activity books, handheld electronics that are only used during toilet-sitting time, or coins or stickers that can be redeemed for small items or toys.\n【57】 Keep a diary of your child's bowel movements, medicines, pain, and accidents . This will help you and your child's doctor or nurse figure out if there are triggers for constipation.\n【58】 Dietary suggestions — There are a number of myths about dietary treatments for constipation in children and infants. Drinking extra fluids and eating a high-fiber diet are not enough to treat repeated episodes of constipation in children; most children also need a laxative and behavior changes. Dietary recommendations are described above.  'Dietary recommendations' above.)\n【59】 Treatment follow-up — After beginning treatment for constipation, most doctors and nurses recommend periodic follow-up phone calls or visits to check on the child. Infants and children with constipation often need adjustments in treatment as they grow, and there are changes in their diet and daily routine.\n【60】 WHEN TO  if your child has severe abdominal or rectal pain.\n【61】 Your infant (younger than four months) has fewer than three bowel movements per week. You should call earlier if your infant has other symptoms such as vomiting or excessive crying.\n【62】 Your infant (younger than four months) has hard (rather than soft or pasty) stools.\n【63】 Your infant or child does not want to eat or loses weight because of constipation.\n【64】 Your infant has a distended abdomen or vomiting.\n【65】 You see blood in your child's bowel movement or diaper.\n【66】 Your child has repeated episodes of constipation.\n【67】 Your child complains of pain with bowel movements.\n【68】 You have trouble toilet training your child or your child refuses to sit on the toilet or seems afraid of having a bowel movement.\n【69】 You have questions or concerns about your child's bowel habits.\n【70】 WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION — Your child's health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your child's medical problem.\n【71】 The Basics — The Basics patient education pieces answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.\n【72】 Beyond the Basics — Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【73】 Professional level information — Professional level articles are designed to keep doctors and other health professionals up-to-date on the latest medical findings. These articles are thorough, long, and complex, and they contain multiple references to the research on which they are based. Professional level articles are best for people who are comfortable with a lot of medical terminology and who want to read the same materials their doctors are reading.\n【74】 National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases\n【75】 American Academy of Pediatrics\n【76】 GI Kids (North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition)\n", "title": "Patient education  Constipation in infants and children (Beyond the Basics)", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/constipation-in-infants-and-children-beyond-the-basics?search=Hirschsprung%E7%97%85&source=search_result&selectedTitle=81%7E81&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:51", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:13:25"}

They are most remarkable for their broad spectrum of clinical behavior, which can range from spontaneous regression, to maturation to a benign ganglioneuroma, or aggressive disease with metastatic dissemination leading to death .\n【3】 Clinical diversity correlates closely with numerous clinical and biological factors (including patient age, tumor stage and histology, and genetic and chromosomal abnormalities). For example, most infants with disseminated disease have a favorable outcome following treatment with chemotherapy and/or surgery, although the majority of children older than one year of age with advanced-stage disease die from progressive disease despite intensive multimodality therapy. This clinical complexity likely derives from the developmental origins of neuroblastoma, which arises due to developmental arrest of maturing components of the embryonic neural crest .\n【4】 Neuroblastoma has been associated with central hypoventilation, Hirschsprung disease, and neurofibromatosis type 1 (neurocristopathy syndrome), and as a familial disorder associated with mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. These are discussed separately.   \"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathology of neuroblastoma\".)\n【5】 The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging evaluation of neuroblastoma will be presented here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, pathology, treatment, and prognosis of neuroblastoma are presented separately.   \"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathology of neuroblastoma\" and  \"Treatment and prognosis of neuroblastoma\".)\n【6】 Olfactory neuroblastoma, a malignancy of the olfactory epithelium, which has a different cell of origin, presentation, and treatment than neuroblastoma, is also discussed separately.   \"Olfactory neuroblastoma (esthesioneuroblastoma)\".)\n【7】 CLINICAL PRESENTATION — Neuroblastomas can arise anywhere throughout the sympathetic nervous system. The adrenal gland is the most common primary site (40 percent), followed by abdominal (25 percent), thoracic (15 percent), cervical (5 percent), and pelvic sympathetic ganglia (5 percent) (image 1) . Less commonly, tumors arise within the central or autonomic nervous systems . In approximately 1 percent of cases, a primary tumor cannot be identified. Neuroblastoma metastasizes to lymph nodes, bone marrow, cortical bone, dura, orbits, liver, and skin, and less frequently to pulmonary and intracranial sites (image 2 and image 3) .\n【8】 Presenting symptoms — The presenting symptoms reflect the location of the primary tumor and the extent of metastatic disease, if present. Patients with localized disease can be asymptomatic, whereas children with advanced disease appear ill at presentation, usually with systemic symptoms.\n【9】 Signs and symptoms of neuroblastoma may include :\n【10】 Abdominal tumors — Approximately two-thirds of primary neuroblastomas arise in the abdomen; among these, approximately two-thirds are from the adrenal glands . Abdominal tumors can present with abdominal pain or fullness, abdominal mass, hypertension, or rarely intestinal obstruction. When the primary tumor arises from the organs of Zuckerkandl (a pair of embryonic organs that persist until shortly after birth and are located near the aortic bifurcation), the child may have symptoms related to compression of the bowel or bladder (eg, constipation, reduced bladder capacity, enuresis) . Large abdominal tumors also can compress venous or lymphatic drainage, leading to scrotal and lower extremity edema. A sudden and dramatic increase in tumor size with abdominal distention and discomfort can result from spontaneous hemorrhage into the tumor .\n【11】 An abdominal mass may be detected in an asymptomatic child by the primary care clinician during a routine examination. The mass is typically, but not always, non-tender, fixed, and firm. Such masses may also be detected initially using abdominal ultrasonography.  'Staging studies' below.)\n【12】 In a review of malignant abdominal masses diagnosed at a children's hospital, the mass was detected by the primary care provider during a well-child or brief acute-care visit in 11 percent of cases, highlighting the importance of the abdominal examination in all patients .\n【13】 Thoracic tumors — Primary thoracic tumors may be detected incidentally on radiographs obtained in the evaluation of other complaints (eg, respiratory symptoms, trauma)   'Paravertebral tumors' below). Mediastinal tumors can cause tracheal deviation or narrowing with resultant stridor, although high thoracic and cervical masses may be associated with a Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis)    \"Horner syndrome\"). Large thoracic tumors, usually associated with mechanical obstruction, may cause the superior vena cava syndrome .   \"Malignancy-related superior vena cava syndrome\".)\n【14】 Paravertebral tumors — Because neuroblastomas may arise from paravertebral sympathetic ganglia (paraganglia), primary tumors (usually in the retroperitoneum or mediastinum) are able to invade the spinal canal through the neural foramina, creating a so-called \"dumbbell\" tumor (image 1). The subsequent epidural spinal cord compression, an oncologic emergency, can cause pain, motor or sensory deficits, or loss of bowel and/or bladder control. The subtle and gradual onset of such neurologic symptoms in young children can make diagnosis difficult.   \"Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression\".)\n【15】 Involvement of the cervical paravertebral sympathetic chain and inferior cervical (stellate) ganglion can result in the Horner syndrome (ipsilateral ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis)    \"Horner syndrome\"). Heterochromia iridis (different colors of the iris or portions of the iris) is common among infants who have congenital Horner syndrome, but also occurs in acquired cases . In one retrospective review of 405 cases of neuroblastoma, unilateral Horner syndrome was present in 14 children (3 percent) and was the presenting sign in nine (2 percent) .\n【16】 Infants with isolated or acquired Horner syndrome should undergo careful examination for cervical and abdominal masses, as well as a measurement of urinary catecholamine metabolites, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) . Radiologic evaluation of the head, neck, and chest is warranted for those who have acquired Horner syndrome, or whose Horner syndrome is associated with other signs (eg, increasing heterochromia, cervical mass, other cranial nerve palsies).  'Is there a role for neuroblastoma screening?' below.)\n【17】 In a retrospective review of 23 infants with an isolated Horner syndrome, urinary VMA was measured in 21, and radiographic imaging (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) of the chest and neck undertaken in 12 . Previously undetected pathology was found in two infants (one with cervical neuroblastoma and another with a benign ganglioneuroma of the left pulmonary apex); a third had been diagnosed with abdominal neuroblastoma before presenting for evaluation of Horner syndrome. Four infants were thought to have birth trauma as an explanation for their Horner syndrome, and no underlying cause was identified among the remaining 16; no additional pathology developed among these patients after a mean 9.3 years of follow-up.\n【18】 Catecholamine secretion — As neuroblastoma is derived from neural crest cells that are destined to form components of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, they frequently express both the norepinephrine transporter gene (NAT, making them metaiodobenzylguanidine [MIBG] avid) and the enzymes required for catecholamine metabolism.  'Staging studies' below.)\n【19】 Degradation of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine lead to the final end products VMA and HVA. Elevated levels of VMA and HVA can be detected in the serum and urine of approximately 70 to 90 percent of patients with neuroblastoma . Testing for these products using high-performance liquid chromatography or other methods can thus be a highly sensitive and specific aid in making the diagnosis of a variety of neuroendocrine tumors including pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma .  'Urine catecholamines' below.)\n【20】 Paraneoplastic syndromes — Several unique paraneoplastic syndromes can be associated with both localized and disseminated neuroblastomas.\n【21】 Opsoclonus myoclonus — Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome (OMS), also known as opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia (OMA), is a paraneoplastic syndrome that occurs in 1 to 3 percent of children with neuroblastoma. Almost 50 percent of children with OMA have an underlying neuroblastoma; neurologic symptoms precede tumor diagnosis in about half of these. The disorder is believed to have an autoimmune pathogenesis.\n【22】 The characteristic symptoms of OMA are rapid, dancing eye movements, rhythmic jerking (myoclonus) involving limbs or trunk, and/or ataxia.\n【23】 All children with OMA must be evaluated for neuroblastoma . If the initial evaluation is unrevealing, it should be repeated in several months.\n【24】 The pathogenesis, clinical features, evaluation, treatment, and prognosis of paraneoplastic OMA are discussed in detail separately.   \"Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome\", section on 'Pediatric syndrome'.)\n【25】 Secretion of VIP — Autonomous tumor secretion of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is another paraneoplastic syndrome that is rarely associated with neuroblastoma. VIP secretion can cause abdominal distension and intractable secretory diarrhea with associated hypokalemia ; these symptoms usually resolve after removal of the tumor .\n【26】 The diagnosis of a VIP-secreting tumor is established by the presence of an otherwise unexplained high-volume secretory diarrhea and a serum VIP concentration in excess of 75 pg/mL. A single elevated VIP level should be confirmed by additional testing. VIP-producing tumors are more often the less aggressive ganglioneuroblastomas and ganglioneuromas rather than undifferentiated neuroblastomas .   \"VIPoma: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\".)\n【27】 Metastatic disease — Neuroblastoma metastasizes by both lymphatic and hematogenous routes. Regional lymph node involvement is found in 35 percent of children who have apparently localized disease . Involvement of lymph nodes outside the cavity or region of origin (ie, abdomen, thorax, pelvis) is considered to represent disseminated disease.\n【28】 Hematogenous spread extends most often to bone, bone marrow, skin, and liver. Metastatic involvement of the liver is common in infants and can cause respiratory compromise . Neuroblastomas also may spread to lung and brain parenchyma, but this usually occurs as a manifestation of relapsing or end-stage disease .\n【29】 Metastatic spread to the bones and bone marrow can cause pain (especially with ambulation), blood count abnormalities, and fever . In young children, who cannot complain of pain, bone pain may manifest as a limp or unexplained irritability. Tumor infiltration of the periorbital bones, typically unilateral, can cause the characteristic periorbital ecchymosis (\"raccoon eyes\"), ptosis, and proptosis. In one retrospective review of 405 cases of neuroblastoma, proptosis or periorbital ecchymosis was present in 15 percent .\n【30】 Metastatic spread to the skin manifests as papules or subcutaneous nodules that can be distributed over the entire body. These lesions are present in approximately one-third of children with congenital neuroblastoma and are typically described as firm, bluish-red, and non-tender . The lesions have a distinctive response to rubbing, characterized by central blanching with a surrounding halo of erythema that persists for 30 to 60 minutes . The differential diagnosis of skin nodules is presented below. Rigorous evaluation is important to determine the etiology of the nodules so that the child can be appropriately treated. Children with skin nodules that are biopsy-proven to be neuroblastoma should undergo a full tumor evaluation by an oncologist.\n【31】 Prenatal diagnosis — Obstetrical sonography has been used with increasing frequency over the past three decades. As the ease and accuracy of third-trimester imaging has improved, and the indications for these studies have broadened, the incidence of prenatal diagnosis of neuroblastoma has risen steadily . Prenatally detected adrenal masses typically are found during ultrasonographic examinations performed after 32 weeks gestation, with the earliest observed at 18 weeks . More than 55 cases of antenatal neuroblastoma have been reported in the literature since the original report in 1983 . One hundred children per year in North America are diagnosed with neuroblastoma either prenatally or at younger than three months of age. Because most of these tumors are present antepartum, the incidence of prenatal diagnosis is likely to continue to rise.\n【32】 If an adrenal tumor was detected on prenatal ultrasonography performed for unrelated reasons and the fetus was otherwise progressing normally, repeat ultrasonography after delivery should be performed. Urine catecholamines also may be helpful in distinguishing a neuroblastoma from other potential masses including adrenal hemorrhage and vascular malformations, although a negative result does not exclude the diagnosis.\n【33】 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — The differential diagnosis of neuroblastoma includes a variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions and varies according to tumor location. Distinguishing these conditions from neuroblastoma may be particularly difficult in patients whose tumors do not produce catecholamines or who do not have an obvious primary tumor .\n【34】 When the tumor arises in a suprarenal location, Wilms' tumor and hepatoblastoma should be considered. In thoracic and retroperitoneal locations, lymphoma, germ cell tumors, and infection should be considered. Metastatic involvement of the bone marrow must be distinguished from lymphoma, small cell osteosarcoma, mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, the Ewing sarcoma family of tumors, primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs), undifferentiated soft-tissue sarcomas such as rhabdomyosarcoma, and leukemia, particularly megakaryoblastic leukemia. If the spinal canal is involved, either as a metastatic lesion or by extension of the primary tumor, the differential diagnosis should extend to other neurodevelopmental tumors such as desmoid tumors, epidermoid tumors, and teratomas, as well as astrocytomas .\n【35】 Opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome may occur in association with other conditions besides neuroblastoma :\n【36】 The differential diagnosis of skin nodules in newborns and infants includes dermoid and other cysts, subcutaneous fat necrosis, benign tumors (eg, infantile myofibromatosis, congenital self-healing reticulohistiocytosis), and other malignant tumors (eg, infantile fibrosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and congenital leukemia). Biopsy may be required for definitive diagnosis.   \"Skin nodules in newborns and infants\".)\n【37】 The causes of secretory diarrhea are listed in the table .\n【38】 DIAGNOSTIC AND STAGING EVALUATION — In children with suspected neuroblastoma, the diagnostic evaluation is best performed at a pediatric cancer center where pediatric oncologists, surgeons, and radiologists familiar with neuroblastoma can be closely involved in the planning and coordination.\n【39】 Diagnostic evaluation — All patients with suspected neuroblastoma should undergo a complete history and physical examination. Most patients will undergo laboratory evaluations including routine blood counts, serum chemistries, and tests of liver and kidney function. Evaluation of urine or serum catecholamine metabolite levels, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA), and homovanillic acid (HVA) should be obtained to assist in diagnosis and monitoring of disease response, since levels are elevated in greater than 70 to 80 percent of patients with neuroblastoma.\n【40】 Biopsy — The diagnosis of neuroblastoma is definitively confirmed on histology using biopsy. Care must be taken to ensure that adequate diagnostic material is obtained for complete characterization of primary tumor. The nature and extent of the initial diagnostic procedure for a child with suspected neuroblastoma should be decided only after consultation with a pediatric surgeon and oncologist who are familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of neuroblastoma.\n【41】 In most patients, diagnostic tissue is usually obtained by incisional or image-guided core needle biopsy of the primary tumor . A bone marrow biopsy/aspirate may be used to diagnose patients suspected to have metastatic disease involving the bone marrow. Based on the choice of biopsy technique, these principles are followed:\n【42】 Tumor tissue or bone marrow, if positive for tumor, must be evaluated for histology (favorable or unfavorable), status of the gene MYCN, DNA ploidy, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at 1p or 11q, preferably at a centralized laboratory if the treating institution does not routinely perform these analyses. Proper handling of the tissues after biopsy is crucial in determining treatment. Thus, biopsy should be undertaken with the guidance of a pediatric oncologist or pediatric surgical oncologist whenever possible.   \"Treatment and prognosis of neuroblastoma\", section on 'Risk stratification'.)\n【43】 Urine catecholamines — Neuroblastoma tumor cells take up and metabolize catecholamines, and the resulting degradation products can be detected in serum and urine. Urinary HVA and VMA levels are useful for both diagnosis and for monitoring disease activity over time. Screening programs for neuroblastoma using urine catecholamines are discussed below.  'Is there a role for neuroblastoma screening?' below.)\n【44】 Diagnostic criteria — Minimum criteria for establishing a diagnosis of neuroblastoma have been agreed upon by an international consensus panel . A definitive diagnosis of neuroblastoma requires one of the following:\n【45】 Staging studies — In patients with suspected neuroblastoma, it is mandatory to obtain complete staging studies before beginning treatment. The goal of these studies is to evaluate the extent of disease. These findings, in turn, determine the clinical and pathologic stage, treatment, and prognosis. The evaluation is best completed at a pediatric cancer center where pediatric oncologists and radiologists familiar with neuroblastoma can be closely involved in the planning and coordination .   \"Treatment and prognosis of neuroblastoma\".)\n【46】 The following studies are necessary for optimal staging:\n【47】 STAGING SYSTEM — Neuroblastomas are staged using the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS)\n【48】 IS THERE A ROLE FOR NEUROBLASTOMA SCREENING? — Universal screening of infants for neuroblastoma with urine catecholamines is not recommended, as data suggest that this approach does not reduce mortality.\n【49】 Screening may be considered in cases where there is a familial history of neuroblastoma. If present, analysis for germline mutation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene should also be performed.   \"Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and pathology of neuroblastoma\", section on 'Molecular abnormalities (prognostic impact)'.)\n【50】 Because outcome is significantly better for patients with localized disease and younger age, several groups have attempted to develop screening programs for neuroblastoma in infancy by measuring urinary catecholamines . The aim of these studies has been to ascertain whether earlier detection would decrease the incidence of high-risk or advanced-stage disease and ultimately improve survival.\n【51】 Four large studies from Japan, Canada, Austria, and Europe have screened over 10 million children at either six to seven months or one year of age. The incidence of neuroblastoma diagnosis was compared with historic controls , unscreened children from the same country , or unscreened populations in other cities . All of these studies were remarkably similar:\n【52】 These observations were supported in a pilot study of observation in Japanese infants with neuroblastoma detected through mass screening . Infants were eligible for inclusion if their tumors were stage I or II\n【53】 An adverse impact of screening was suggested in the study from Canada, in which 2 of the 43 patients whose tumors were detected by screening had significant adverse effects because of treatment for their favorable-prognosis neuroblastoma . Another study demonstrated that expectant observation of infants younger than six months with small adrenal masses resulted in favorable event-free and overall survival outcomes for most patients, while also avoiding surgical morbidity .\n【54】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Neuroblastomas\".)\n", "title": "神经母细胞瘤的临床表现、诊断和分期评估", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-evaluation-of-neuroblastoma?search=%E7%94%9F%E7%89%A9%E7%B4%A0%E7%BC%BA%E4%B9%8F&source=search_result&selectedTitle=6%7E12&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:51", "update_time": "2024-03-04 19:57:04"}

Colic is one of the most distressing problems of infancy. It is distressing for the infant, the parents, and for the health care provider. The cause of colic is not well understood, but it resolves in most infants by three to four months of age. Even though it usually goes away on its own, it can be helpful to learn more about colic to gain a better understanding of this difficult stage of your baby's life.\n【2】 COLIC DEFINITIONS — Colic is defined as \"excessive crying.\" An infant with colic usually cries for more than three hours per day on more than three days per week.\n【3】 Colic is extremely common and occurs in up to 40 percent of all infants. It usually starts sometime between the third and sixth week after birth and ends when a baby is three to four months of age. Colic occurs with equal frequency in the following groups:\n【4】 Males and females\n【5】 Breast- and bottle-fed infants\n【6】 Full-term and preterm infants\n【7】 The first and second child (and other siblings as well)\n【8】 Normal crying patterns — All infants cry more during the first three months of life than during any other time. There is no standard definition for \"excessive\" crying, although it is normal for infants to cry for up to two hours per day. Infants without colic cry, although generally less frequently and for a shorter time than infants with colic.\n【9】 Colic — Colic is more than excessive \"normal\" crying, at least in some infants. Colic differs from \"normal\" in the following ways:\n【10】 The crying episodes generally last a total of more than three hours per day.\n【11】 Each episode of colic has a clear beginning and end, and the onset is unrelated to what was happening before the episode started; the infant may have been happy, fussy, feeding, or even sleeping. The crying episode begins suddenly and often occurs in the evening hours.\n【12】 Colic episodes are more intense, louder, and higher pitched than \"normal\" crying. Infants with colic may sound as if they are in pain or are screaming.\n【13】 Infants with colic may have physical symptoms .\n【14】 Infants with colic are difficult or impossible to soothe, no matter what the parents do. There may be periods of quiet, but infants often remain fussy. Crying may end after the infant passes gas or a bowel movement.\n【15】 For all infants, colic is a temporary problem. It resolves by three months of age in 60 percent of infants and by four months in 90 percent of infants.\n【16】 OTHER CAUSES OF EXCESSIVE CRYING — There are a number of reasons, other than colic, that an infant may cry excessively; these can range from simple problems such as hunger to more serious problems such as infection.\n【17】 A parent should first check for manageable causes of crying:\n【18】 Hunger – Try feeding the baby to  feed every two to four hours, all babies go through periods when they will want to feed more frequently (usually during growth spurts).\n【19】 Pain – Check to .\n【20】 Fatigue or overstimulation – Babies often cry when they become tired or overstimulated from playing or being handled. Swaddling the baby loosely, leaving room for the legs to move  may help the baby to fall asleep.\n【21】 Food sensitivities – Infants can have an allergy or sensitivity to foods in their mother's diet or a component of their formula. Foods such as milk, eggs, nuts, and wheat in a mother's diet have a direct effect on the composition of her breast milk; these foods can occasionally cause food reactions and digestive problems such as abdominal pain, cramping, and diarrhea. Infants also can be allergic to a protein in cow's milk-based formulas or dairy products consumed by the mother (if the infant is breastfeeding); cow's milk protein allergy may cause fussiness and blood in the stools. Lactose (a type of sugar found in cow's milk) intolerance has little to no effect on the development of colic.\n【22】 Food sensitivities may be suspected if an infant cries or spits up a large amount within an hour of feeding or if a baby has constipation or diarrhea. Symptoms of cow's milk allergy include eczema, wheezing, diarrhea, or vomiting. Symptoms of cow's milk protein allergy include fussiness and blood in the stool.   \"\n【23】 If these causes have been eliminated and the baby continues to cry excessively, parents should speak with their health care provider. Most infants who cry excessively do not have a serious underlying medical problem; a health care provider can help to make this determination.  'When to\n【24】 COLIC DIAGNOSIS — The diagnosis of colic is often made after it has run its typical three- to four-month course. If you are concerned about your infant's crying, call your child's doctor or nurse to discuss your concerns and possible management strategies.\n【25】 Home monitoring — You can monitor your infant's crying by keeping a written record of the following information. You can share this information with your child's doctor or nurse to help determine the cause of crying as well as the best ways to manage it.\n【26】 When does crying occur and how long does it last? Crying that occurs directly after feeding may be caused by gastroesophageal reflux (heartburn) or swallowed air.   \"\n【27】 Does the crying begin at the same time every day? Does the infant cry at other times of the day?\n【28】 What seems to trigger an episode of crying? What helps to stop crying?\n【29】 What do you do when the baby cries? You can hurt your child if you yell, shake, or hit.\n【30】 What does the cry sound like? Infants with colic often have a higher pitched, louder, and more intense sounding cry.\n【31】 How and what do you feed the baby? As mentioned above, overfeeding, underfeeding, and feeding inappropriate foods can cause colic.\n【32】 Is the crying getting better, worse, or is it about the same?\n【33】 How do you feel when the baby cries? Living with a colicky infant is hard; some parents feel overwhelmed and incapable of caring for their infant, while others blame the infant for being difficult.\n【34】 How has colic affected your family? Colic affects all members of a household, and it is important to consider input from everyone.\n【35】 Why do you think the baby cries? Discuss your thoughts and concerns about your infant with your child's doctor or nurse.\n【36】 COLIC MYTHS AND FACTS — There are a number of myths about the causes and treatments of colic. Myths often develop to explain problems that are not well understood. You can learn to separate myths from facts through education and support from respected sources, including health care providers.\n【37】 Babies do not cry to manipulate you.\n【38】 It is not possible to spoil a baby by holding or comforting them.\n【39】 Rice cereal does not improve colic. Infants should be given only breast milk or formula until they are four to six months old, unless told otherwise by a health care provider.   \"\n【40】 Studies show that simethicone (sample brand name: Mylicon) and lactase (the enzyme that helps to digest lactose, the sugar in milk) do not help with colic. Simethicone may also react with levothyroxine, a drug used to treat congenital hypothyroidism, resulting in inadequate treatment of the hypothyroidism .\n【41】 COLIC MANAGEMENT — The goals of treatment for colic are to decrease the infant's crying, help your family cope, and prevent long-term difficulties in your family's relationships. Many doctors recommend trying several strategies at once .\n【42】 Parental support — Parents of infants with colic often feel frustrated, angry, exhausted, guilty, and helpless because of their child's crying. These feelings are normal and do not indicate that you are incapable or unworthy of caring for your child.\n【43】 Take a break — It is normal for you to need a break from a child who cries excessively. If you are alone and need a break, leave the infant in a safe place for a few minutes; the infant should be placed on their back in a crib or bassinet with side rails. Loose blankets, pillows, and toys that could potentially suffocate the child should be removed.\n【44】 Taking a break allows you to call a friend or relative for help, get away from the crying, and can prevent you from potentially harming your child. Shaking, smothering, or slapping will not stop an infant's crying but can seriously injure or even kill the child. In the United States, you can call 24 hours a day, seven days a week and speak with a professional counselor at 1-800-4-A-CHILD (422-4453).\n【45】 Shaken baby syndrome is the term used to describe the injuries suffered by infants who are violently shaken, often by a parent or other adult who has become overwhelmed by excessive crying. Infants do not have sufficient strength in their neck to limit head movement, and shaking causes the head to move suddenly and uncontrollably. As the head moves backwards and forwards, the brain hits the inside of the skull, causing serious damage and even death.   \"\n【46】 Dietary and feeding technique changes\n【47】 Bottle-fed infants — A number of devices (nipples, bottles) have been designed to decrease the amount of air swallowed during feeding. You may try positioning your infant in a vertical (sitting up) position while feeding. You may also try a curved bottle or collapsible bag, in combination with frequent burping. These techniques can reduce the amount of air swallowed, which may reduce colic in some infants.\n【48】 Some studies suggest that infants with colic improve when their formula is switched to a soy-based or hypoallergenic formula. However, the results of these studies are inconclusive. Consult with your infant's doctor or nurse to determine if a formula change might be helpful.\n【49】 Some doctors suggest a trial of a different formula for one week (for bottle-fed infants). The original formula should be restarted if there is no change; low allergy (hypoallergenic) and soy-based formulas are more expensive than traditional formula and do not need to be continued if crying does not improve after a one-week trial of the new formula.\n【50】 Breastfed infants — Mothers who breastfeed may try consuming a hypoallergenic diet to reduce their infant's colic. A hypoallergenic diet eliminates potentially aggravating food groups, including milk, eggs, nuts, and wheat.\n【51】 To try a hypoallergenic diet, stop eating a single food group for a one-week trial period while you monitor the infant's crying. You can restart the food if you do not .\n【52】 There is no evidence that stopping breastfeeding and starting formula is of any benefit in babies who have colic. There are a number of benefits to breastfeeding and breast milk that are not available with formula.   \"\n【53】 Carrying — Some parents find that carrying their infant in their arms, a sling, or a front carrier can decrease the infant's and parents' anxiety. Although studies have not proven carrying to be effective for all infants, it is worth trying if your infant has not responded to other treatments. Using a sling or front carrier frees your hands and arms and allows you to move around while monitoring your infant.\n【54】 Change in environment — There are many other techniques that may help to reduce crying: a pacifier, ride in the car, change of scenery, infant swing, and warm baths have been suggested and may help to soothe an infant with colic.\n【55】 Swaddling  may be soothing. Placing the infant near a white noise machine or clothes dryer may soothe an infant who is sensitive to noise.\n【56】 Probiotics — Probiotics are microorganisms that have beneficial properties for the host (sometimes called \"good bacteria\"). Most commercially available probiotics are prepared from food sources like cultured milk (eg, Lactobacillus).\n【57】 Some studies suggest that a particular probiotic, Lactobacillus reuteri, may be helpful in children with colic. However, additional studies are needed to confirm these results and to determine whether other probiotics may be more helpful.\n【58】 Talk to your doctor or nurse before giving your infant any probiotic. Probiotics may not be appropriate and could be dangerous in some cases.\n【59】 Herbal remedies — Herbs such as chamomile, fennel seed, and balm-mint are thought to have antispasmodic properties and have been used in infants with colic. Although a few studies have shown improvement in infants given a tea made with a specific mix of herbs, parents should be cautious about trying this type of treatment.\n【60】 Gripe water is a mixture of herbs and water that has been promoted for its ability to cure colic. However, various types of gripe water have been found to contain dangerous ingredients, including glass particles and alcohol. A homeopathic remedy, colocynthis (found in cocyntal and Hyland colic tablets) was also found to contain dangerous ingredients (including alcohol) .\n【61】 Talk to your doctor or nurse before giving your infant any herbal remedy; herbal remedies may not be appropriate and could be dangerous in some cases.\n【62】 Infant massage — Infant massage has been recommended to parents of infants with colic, although no studies have proven it to be of clear benefit.\n【63】 WHEN TO SEEK HELP — Call your child's doctor or nurse during the day or night if any of the following occur:\n【64】 The baby has cried continuously for more than two hours.\n【65】 You are afraid that you or another caretaker may hurt the baby, or if someone has shaken the baby.\n【66】 If crying could be the result of an injury or fall.\n【67】 The baby has a fever of ≥100.4°F (38°C). Parents should call their infant's health care provider or go to an emergency department immediately. This table describes how to take a child's temperature\n【68】 The infant refuses to eat or drink anything for more than a few hours, vomits excessively, is not urinating well, has bloody stools, or has a change in behavior, including lethargy or decreased responsiveness.\n【69】 A parent should call their child's health care provider's office during normal office hours if any of the following occur:\n【70】 You cannot soothe your baby's crying or you have questions or concerns about how to manage your crying baby\n【71】 Excessive crying continues after the infant is older than four months\n【72】 The infant fails to gain weight\n【73】 LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF COLIC — Colic can take a toll on families. Some researchers have suggested that colic interferes with child-parent interactions and can have a long-term effect on the family and child.\n【74】 Long-term studies have examined the possible relationships between colic and later childhood, including temperament, sleep patterns, family functioning, asthma, and cognitive development. However, no significant relationship between colic and these features of later childhood have been proven.\n【75】 WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION — Your child's health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your child's medical problem.\n【76】 This article will be updated as needed on our website. Related topics for patients and caregivers, as well as selected articles written for health care professionals, are also available.

Because these methods do not involve the use of heat, the likelihood of adjacent nerve injury is reduced, and tumescent anesthetic infiltration is not necessary.\n【2】 Nonthermal ablation techniques for the treatment of superficial venous insufficiency are reviewed.\n【3】 Alternative approaches to treatment of superficial venous insufficiency and comparisons of the various techniques are discussed separately.\n【4】 VENOUS ANATOMY — The superficial veins of the lower extremity are classified as axial or nonaxial. The axial veins include the great, small, and accessory saphenous veins\n【5】 The deep veins of the lower extremity are contained within the deep muscle compartments bounded by the muscular fascia\n【6】 Perforator veins are those veins that traverse the muscular fascia to connect superficial veins with the deep veins. These are located anteriorly, posteriorly, laterally, and medially in both the thigh and calf.   \"Classification of lower extremity chronic venous disorders\" and  \"Classification of lower extremity chronic venous disorders\", section on 'Perforator veins (Ap)'.)\n【7】 INDICATIONS — The decision to offer nonthermal, nontumescent ablation depends upon symptoms, response to conservative therapy, extent of lower extremity disease, and likelihood of providing a durable benefit, either with respect to appearance or improvement in symptoms.\n【8】 Nonthermal, nontumescent ablation techniques can be used to achieve axial vein closure (eg, great saphenous vein, small saphenous vein) or perforator vein closure for patients with documented reflux (ie, retrograde flow >0.5 seconds in a superficial vein or perforating vein) as a source of symptoms.  'Saphenous ablation' below and 'Perforator ablation' below.)\n【9】 For patients with venous ulceration who are refractory to medical management or have recurrent ulceration, ablation of perforators may help heal ulcers and prevent recurrence. Only pathologic perforator veins should be treated. A pathologic perforator vein is defined as one that demonstrates outward flow (reflux) of greater than 0.5 seconds, has a diameter of greater than 3.5 mm, and is located under an active or healed venous ulceration . This means that perforator veins should only be treated in patients with CEAP classification C5 and C6 disease. There is no benefit for treating incompetent perforator veins in patients with only varicose veins.   \"Overview of lower extremity chronic venous disease\", section on 'With perforator reflux'.)\n【10】 For all patients, it is important to address patient expectations and to discuss potential adverse effects, treatment failure, complications, and alternative treatment methods. Alternatives to nonthermal, nontumescent ablation for superficial venous reflux include no intervention (ie, ongoing conservative management), thermal ablation (ie, radiofrequency laser ablation, endovenous laser ablation), or surgical removal.   \"Techniques for radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of lower extremity chronic venous disease\" and  \"Techniques for endovenous laser ablation for the treatment of lower extremity chronic venous disease\" and  \"Approach to treating symptomatic superficial venous insufficiency\".)\n【11】 Contraindications — Sclerosing agents or glue should not be used in patients who have signs of acute venous thrombosis (superficial, deep). While other ablation techniques have been investigated for managing superficial venous thrombosis, the results of these studies cannot be generalized to the use of sclerosing agents or glue.\n【12】 Pregnant individuals should defer treatment until after delivery.\n【13】 Specific hypersensitivities or risk for adverse reactions may preclude the use of any particular technique.  'Complications' below.)\n【14】 A history of migraine headache and patent foramen ovale are relative contraindications to the use of a foamed sclerosing agent such as physician-compounded foam using room air, due to a risk for microembolism .  'Sclerotherapy' below.)\n【15】 NONTHERMAL ABLATION METHODS\n【16】 Sclerotherapy — Sclerotherapy injects liquid or foam sclerosing agents into a vein, which causes endothelial damage and induces thrombosis. The most common sclerosing agents used in the treatment of chronic venous disease are polidocanol, hypertonic saline, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, and glycerin . Of these agents, only polidocanol and sodium tetradecyl sulfate have been approved for sclerotherapy by the US Food and Drug Administration. Foam preparations are particularly useful for nonthermal, nontumescent ablation of the axial veins given the overall volume of sclerosant that is needed . Sclerosant foam was developed from the detergent sclerosant agents .\n【17】 Foam preparations — Foam preparations are used to treat larger veins (≥6 mm). The foam is necessary to displace the increased volume of blood in these larger veins. For saphenous venous ablation, foam preparations (physician compounded, polidocanol endovenous microfoam [PEM]) have distinct advantages. Compared with liquid agents, the expanded volume of the foam provides more surface contact, a more uniform vessel closure, and requires smaller volumes of sclerosant. The relative effectiveness of foam compared with liquid sclerotherapy for ablation of the great saphenous vein is discussed below.  'Foam versus liquid sclerotherapy' below.)\n【18】 Ultrasound guidance — Ultrasound imaging accurately guides delivery of the foam into the intended veins since the sclerosant foam is echogenic due to the gas component. For great saphenous ablation, the foam sclerosant is typically administered through a micropuncture sheath or intravenous catheter placed near the knee, above the proximal calf perforator veins. Foam sclerotherapy is especially useful for very tortuous saphenous veins, as it is the only method of endovenous ablation that does not require catheter placement along the length of the vein. Ablation with a foam sclerosant is also extremely useful for treating recanalized veins or veins with webbing or synechiae in which a catheter would not easily be passed proximally. Larger varicose veins can also be treated in the same session as saphenous ablation.\n【19】 Mechanochemical ablation — Endovenous mechanochemical ablation (MOCA; ie, ClariVein) uses an agitating wire to cause venospasm and mild injury to the endothelial lining of the vein while simultaneously injecting a sclerosing agent. Either polidocanol or sodium tetradecyl sulfate can be used. Venospasm increases the contact time between the sclerosant and the endothelium, which augments closure. MOCA is applicable to virtually all veins that are straight enough to allow catheter placement but is particularly useful for very superficial veins and those below the knee since there is no chance of nerve injury (unlike thermal ablation) and there is no residual foreign body (unlike glue). When MOCA is used to treat the saphenous veins, venous cannulation is at the knee or ankle; the wire is activated 2 cm from the saphenofemoral junction .\n【20】 Compared with endovenous ablation methods, MOCA is associated with lower initial closure rates, but among the endovenous and other ablation therapies is associated with the least amount of pain . In the MARADONA trial, which randomly assigned 213 patients to MOCA or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), while pain scores were lower, hyperpigmentation occurred more often with MOCA (7 versus 2 patients) . Clinical success at one and two years were similar despite more recanalizations with MOCA. In the Laser Ablation versus Mechanical Ablation trial, which randomly assigned 150 patients to MOCA or EVLA, duplex-derived anatomic occlusion rates were lower for MOCA at one year (53/69 [77 percent] versus 63/69 [91 percent]), but the improvement in the venous severity score and quality-of-life scores were similar .\n【21】 MOCA has also been validated as safe and painless for the treatment of small saphenous vein incompetence. In one review, occlusion rates were 92.6 percent at one year with no sural nerve injuries or other major complications .\n【22】 Cyanoacrylate adhesive closure — Cyanoacrylate adhesive closure (CAC) is a catheter-directed procedure that seals the saphenous vein without the use of tumescent anesthesia. CAC was initially described for the treatment of saphenous insufficiency in 2013 . An adhesive sealing system (ie, VenaSeal) was later approved for use in the United States in 2015 . The procedure is performed in a manner like RFA and endovenous laser ablation, but without the need for tumescent anesthesia. Closure rates for CAC are high without use of postprocedure compression, which is unique to this nonthermal method of ablation .\n【23】 To perform CAC, the catheter is positioned in the saphenous vein 5 cm from the saphenofemoral junction, and the proximal great saphenous vein is compressed with the ultrasound probe to prevent migration of the glue into the deep veins . An aliquot of cyanoacrylate adhesive is injected into the vein, the catheter is pulled back, and pressure is held. This process is repeated until the entire vein is occluded from 5 cm distal to the saphenofemoral junction to the distal point of reflux. The total volume of adhesive delivered is generally less than 1.5 mL.\n【24】 In the European Multicenter Cohort Study on Cyanoacrylate Embolization (eSCOPE), great saphenous ablation was performed in 70 patients . Closure rates by life table analysis at 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up were 91.4, 90, 88.5, and 88.5 percent, respectively. Through 36 months, the reduction in venous clinical severity score from 4.3 at baseline to 0.9 was significant.\n【25】 In randomized trials comparing adhesive ablation with radiofrequency venous ablation, outcomes were similar, and in one trial, longer-term (60 month) occlusion rates were improved for CAC compared with RFA . The VenaSeal Sapheon Closure System Pivotal Study (VeClose) randomly assigned 220 patients with symptomatic great saphenous vein incompetence to a proprietary CAC system or RFA . The early closure rate at three months was 99 percent for CAC and 96 percent for RFA demonstrating noninferiority, which persisted at 24 months and 60 months follow-up . The feasibility of CAC for perforator veins was investigated in a separate study; there were no serious complications .\n【26】 SAPHENOUS ABLATION — Venous reflux in axial veins can be treated using a variety of techniques. For the great saphenous vein, thermal ablation (eg, endovenous laser ablation [EVLA], radiofrequency ablation [RFA]), mechanochemical ablation (MOCA), and glue are all associated with higher rates of vein closure (immediate and long term) compared with liquid or foam sclerotherapy . The rationale used for selecting foam sclerotherapy to treat the great saphenous vein is based on similar long-term, patient-derived clinical outcome measures in the available trials, rather than strictly on rates of vein occlusion . In addition, foam sclerotherapy is easily repeated. The approach to treating superficial venous insufficiency is discussed in more detail separately. Treatment of other axial veins (small saphenous, accessory saphenous) follows similar principles .   \"Approach to treating symptomatic superficial venous insufficiency\" and  \"Comparison of methods for endovenous ablation for chronic venous disease\", section on 'Vein closure'.)\n【27】 Foam versus liquid sclerotherapy — When sclerotherapy is selected to treat the great saphenous vein, we suggest foam rather than liquid sclerotherapy. In randomized trials, foam sclerotherapy was more successful initially at eliminating saphenous reflux compared with liquid sclerotherapy . In a meta-analysis of seven trials using polidocanol for a variety of clinical situations, efficacy was significantly improved for foam compared with liquid formulations (odds ratio 5.64, 95% CI 3.83-8.10) . These results were similar to an earlier meta-analysis of three trials limited to saphenous vein ablation in which the efficacy of foam compared with liquid was 76.8 versus 39.5 percent, respectively . For the small saphenous vein, closure rates of 91 to 94 percent at 12 months follow-up have been reported for foam sclerotherapy .\n【28】 Foam sclerotherapy is also associated with lower rates of recanalization compared with liquid sclerotherapy in the longer term . In trial that randomized 95 patients, elimination of great saphenous reflux occurred in 85 percent of patients with foam sclerotherapy compared with 35 percent with liquid sclerotherapy . The success rates at two years were 53 percent in the foam group and 12 percent in the liquid group. The significantly improved closure rates for foam sclerotherapy and the practical issues discussed above  'Sclerotherapy' above) favor the use of foam for saphenous ablation and outweigh the potential for complications associated with its use (local, systemic), which are overall uncommon.  'Complications' below.)\n【29】 Recurrence rates — Vein recurrence rates following saphenous vein sclerotherapy are related to saphenous recanalization . In a trial that randomly assigned 500 patients with great saphenous reflux (580 legs) to RFA, EVLA, ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy (UGFS), or surgery (high ligation and stripping) , the recurrence rate at five-year follow-up was significantly higher for foam sclerotherapy compared with RFA or EVLA (5.8 and 6.8 percent versus 31.5 percent). A later systematic review identified a median recurrence rate of 8.1 percent in 69 studies of foam sclerotherapy . While a single session of UGFS is moderately successful for treating the saphenous veins, higher long-term success rates may be seen with additional vein treatment sessions . In one review, 90 percent of great saphenous veins were free of recanalization with two sessions over a mean 39 months of follow-up .\n【30】 For either liquid or foam sclerotherapy, symptoms often do not necessarily correlate with vein recurrence or recanalization. Duplex ultrasound can show procedural failure, yet some of these patients may still have clinical improvement that is maintained long-term . Anatomic failure is a useful term to distinguish these patients from those with clinical failure (ie, recurrent clinical symptoms and/or varicose veins). Anatomic failure is classified as type I, II, or III, depending on the timing of failure and etiology .\n【31】 Foam sclerotherapy technique — To treat reflux of the great saphenous vein, foam sclerotherapy is performed using ultrasound guidance (ie, UGFS). The saphenous vein is cannulated in the mid- to distal thigh with the needle or sheath directed cephalad. Manual compression is used just caudal to the access site to prevent the foam from traveling into the distal saphenous vein. The extremity is elevated, and sclerosant foam is injected until the foam can be seen approaching the saphenofemoral junction on ultrasound. When the foam is 5 cm from the saphenofemoral junction, the vein is compressed proximally with the ultrasound probe, and the distal pressure is released. Continued injection will fill the tributary varicosities and the great saphenous vein distal to the cannulation site. To help prevent deep vein thrombosis, the patient is often asked to perform a series of dorsiflexion maneuvers following the injection to clear any foam that may have entered the deep venous system.\n【32】 In a study that evaluated a small number of patients for whom UGFS was performed in combination with compression of the saphenofemoral junction, this practice reduced but did not completely prevent migration of the foam . Some postulate that release of compression could promote microembolization.\n【33】 PERFORATOR ABLATION — The presence of reflux in perforator veins following saphenous ablation is a known risk factor for vein recurrence and venous ulcer nonhealing or recurrence . The ideal technique for perforator ablation has not been established. Some clinicians prefer to use a liquid sclerosant, while others use foam because it does not flow as readily, it can be more easily  . This technique has been used with good long-term results and without significant complications but requires an experienced practitioner .\n【34】 Sclerotherapy of perforator veins is associated with fewer complications compared with surgical management of perforators (ie, subfascial endoscopic perforator surgery [SEPS]) and is clinically appealing for this indication; however, there are few studies. Ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy of perforator veins does appear to reduce the severity of symptoms and signs as determined by venous clinical severity scores. Following a single treatment, closure following ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy of perforators occurs in about two-thirds. In one trial, ulcer healing was ultimately observed in 32 of 37 limbs treated by ultrasound-guided perforator sclerotherapy . This group of patients did not have concomitant axial venous reflux. Approximately 75 percent of perforator veins remained closed up to five years following treatment. Clinical improvement was sustained at a mean follow-up of 20.1 months.\n【35】 Following ultrasound-guided sclerotherapy of perforator veins, duplex ultrasound should be performed at three to six weeks to identify recurrent perforator veins that can lead to venous ulcer recurrence. In one study, complete closure of all incompetent perforator veins was the only predictor of ulcer healing .\n【36】 POSTPROCEDURE CARE AND FOLLOW-UP — With sclerotherapy, there is a risk of deep vein thrombosis, and duplex ultrasound 48 hours postprocedure is often obtained .  'Venous thromboembolism' below.)\n【37】 When foam sclerotherapy is performed, the patient should be instructed to call their clinician if they experience unusual coughing or visual, sensory, or motor disturbances, particularly if a physician-compounded foam has been used.  'Foam preparations' above and 'Visual and other neurologic disturbances' below.)\n【38】 Following nonthermal saphenous ablation using sclerotherapy, there is no consensus or high-quality evidence to direct the type and duration of postoperative compression . We advise our patients to wear compression stockings continuously for 48 hours after treatment, after which time they may be worn during the day (off at night and to bathe) for the next two weeks. Most trials have evaluated compression bandaging schemes for liquid injection sclerotherapy, but it appears that short-term compression therapy for foam sclerotherapy is also favored . One trial randomly assigned 128 patients to 24 hours of compression bandaging followed by antiembolism stockings or to five days of bandaging . No significant differences were found in phlebitis scores or pain scores at two-week follow-up. At six weeks, vein occlusion rates, skin changes, and venous severity measures were also similar. Another trial randomly assigned 60 patients undergoing foam sclerotherapy of the saphenous vein to compression stockings or no compression . Vein closure rates, side effects, and patient satisfaction between the groups at 14 days and one-month follow-up were similar.\n【39】 For cyanoacrylate adhesive closure, postprocedure compression may not be necessary, though is used by some clinicians to decrease the rate of phlebitis. In two trials, compression was not used, and closure rates were high .\n【40】 COMPLICATIONS — Symptomatic venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) is overall uncommon . However, endovenous foam or endovenous glue-induced thrombosis (EGIT) analogous to endovenous heat-induced thrombosis [EHIT] for thermal ablation techniques has been reported. Other complications include anaphylaxis and microembolic events as evidenced by coughing, migraine-like headache, visual disturbance, paresthesia, or stroke . An unusual complication of inadvertent saphenous vein stripping has been reported in association with mechanochemical ablation, wherein the rotating wire was caught on a valve leaflet .\n【41】 Venous thromboembolism — With foam sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein, maneuvers such as elevation of the treated limb and compression at the groin are performed to limit the foam from entering the deep veins; however, some invariably does enter the systemic circulation. A systematic review of foam sclerotherapy reported rates of deep venous thrombosis occurring in 0.02 to 5.7 percent . Venous thrombosis has also been reported in the popliteal vein following foam sclerotherapy of the small saphenous vein , and following perforator ablation . The diagnosis and treatment for deep venous thrombosis in this setting follows standard protocols.   \"Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity\".)\n【42】 The incidence of deep vein thrombosis for foam sclerotherapy may be increased compared with thermal and other nonthermal, nontumescent ablation techniques. In the VANISH-2 trial, the incidence of deep vein thrombosis was 10 percent . However, 9 of 24 of the events were considered extension of thrombus from the treated vein (ie, endovenous foam-induced thrombosis). In a separate trial, 10 patients developed deep vein thrombosis; all were asymptomatic and detected on routine follow-up ultrasound .\n【43】 Endovenous glue-induced thrombosis — EGIT (extension of thrombus into a deep vein) can occur with cyanoacrylate adhesive closure (CAC), analogous to EHIT occurring with thermal ablation techniques. Like EHIT, most EGIT have no associated significant symptoms and either regress or do not change .\n【44】 In a review of 191 patients undergoing CAC, EGIT developed in 11 patients (5.8 percent) . A grading scheme was suggested. EGIT grade I occurred in seven (63.6 percent) and grade II in four (36.4 percent) patients. Only a preoperative saphenous vein diameter of <5 mm increased the risk of EGIT.\n【45】 Visual and other neurologic disturbances — Visual or neurologic disturbance is uncommon during or following liquid or foam sclerotherapy. In a systematic review, the incidence of visual disturbance following sclerotherapy ranged from 0.09 to 2 percent . The disturbance is usually transient; permanent deficits are rare . Symptoms include transient visual disturbance (ie, scotoma), migraine-like headache, and neurologic deficits. These appear to be more common with foam compared with liquid sclerotherapy and likely related to physician-compounded microfoam using room air .  'Sclerotherapy' above.)\n【46】 During foam sclerotherapy of the great saphenous vein, microbubbles can be detected in the right heart and pulmonary circulation in patients with a patent foramen ovale (PFO) and in the left heart as well . Coughing following foam sclerotherapy has been attributed to air microembolization into the pulmonary circulation. In a prospective study of 33 patients, cardiac echo was performed during foam sclerotherapy, with cardiac microemboli detected in every patient studied. Microemboli were also  of PFO in the general population, it is apparent that the incidence of significant neurologic sequelae following foam sclerotherapy is low. Nevertheless, caution needs to be exercised when performing foam sclerotherapy in any patient known to have a PFO. Patients who develop neurologic symptoms following foam sclerotherapy should be referred for further cardiac evaluation and are advised to avoid future sclerotherapy.   \"Patent foramen ovale\" and  \"Atrial septal abnormalities (PFO, ASD, and ASA) and risk of cerebral emboli in adults\".)\n【47】 Because visual and neurologic disturbances have been reported with nonfoamed (ie, liquid) sclerosant solutions and have occurred in the absence of a PFO, an alternative theory proposes that visual and neurologic symptoms related to sclerotherapy are due to the release of endothelin, a potent vasoconstrictor. One group reported increased concentrations of endothelin in the blood following injection with various sclerosing agents, first in an animal model and then in humans .\n【48】 Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis — Cyanoacrylate adhesive remains within the vein permanently and constitutes a foreign body. There is a high cross-reactivity with adhesive allergies. One study noted an incidence of 6 percent of patients will have a type IV hypersensitivity reaction or intolerance of the glue . Skin testing may be indicated for patients with a tape or adhesive allergy or prior adverse reactions to acrylic nail or faux eyelash applications to ensure safe use of cyanoacrylate. In clinical practice, when a reaction does occur, it typically requires a short course of steroids and is not insignificant. In very rare cases, excision of the previously treated vein was needed.\n【49】 Anaphylaxis can occur with any of the sclerosing agents except hypertonic saline. A test dose of the sclerosing agent is recommended\n【50】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Chronic venous disorders\".)\n【51】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Diagnosis is important, as timely ASD repair improves outcomes.   \"Management of atrial septal defects in adults\".)\n【2】 The anatomy, pathophysiology, natural history, clinical features, diagnosis, and assessment of ASDs in adults will be reviewed here .\n【3】 The management of ASDs in adults and issues related to ASDs in children are discussed separately.   \"Management of atrial septal defects in adults\" and  \"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis\" and  \"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Management and outcome\".)\n【4】 EMBRYOLOGY AND CLASSIFICATION — ASDs result from lack of sufficient tissue to completely septate the atria and are classified according to their location in the atrial septum, as described in the following sections . The location of the defect in relation to adjacent cardiac structures defines the anomalies associated with the ASD and impacts the natural history and requirements for repair.\n【5】 Atrial septation begins as early as the fifth week of gestation. The septum primum arises from the superior portion of the common atrium and grows caudally to the endocardial cushions located between the atria and ventricles, eventually closing the orifice (ostium primum) between the atria .\n【6】 Flow through the foramen ovale is essential for fetal circulation. The foramen ovale closes spontaneously within the first two years of life in 70 percent of children. However, in a significant proportion (20 to 30 percent) of the population, the septa do not fuse, leading to a patent foramen ovale, which is discussed separately.   \"Patent foramen ovale\".)\n【7】 Secundum ASD — Secundum ASD accounts for 70 to 75 percent of all ASDs. Secundum ASD is a defect in the septum primum resulting from poor growth of the secundum septum or excessive absorption of the septum\n【8】 Secundum ASDs are occasionally associated with partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection and/or pulmonary stenosis. The rare combination of an ASD with rheumatic mitral stenosis is known as Lutembacher syndrome.   \"Rheumatic mitral stenosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\" and  \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease\".)\n【9】 Primum ASD — Primum ASD accounts for 15 to 20 percent of ASDs. A primum ASD is a defect in the septum secundum caused by failure of the primum septum to fuse with the endocardial cushions at the base of the interatrial septum\n【10】 Discrete subaortic stenosis as well as elongation (often referred to as a \"goose-neck deformity\") of the left ventricular outflow tract are often seen in association with endocardial cushion defects. Endocardial cushion defects are often noted in patients with Trisomy 21.\n【11】 Sinus venosus defect — Sinus venosus defects account for 5 to 10 percent of ASDs and are located in the venoatrial portion of the atrial septum. Sinus venosus defects represent an abnormality in the insertion of the superior or inferior vena cava, which overrides the interatrial septum; the interatrial communication is then formed within the mouth of the overriding vein and is outside the area of the fossa ovalis  . Sinus venosus defects are of two types :\n【12】 Superior sinus venosus defects are located immediately below the orifice of the superior vena cava. The right upper lobe and middle lobe pulmonary veins often connect to the junction of the superior vena cava and right atrium or on the superior vena cava, resulting in a partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection .   \"Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return\".)\n【13】 Inferior sinus venosus defects, also known as inferior vena caval defects, are much less common. They are located immediately above the orifice of the inferior vena cava. These defects are also often associated with partial anomalous connection of the right pulmonary veins to the junction of the right atrium and inferior vena cava.\n【14】 Unroofed coronary sinus — Unroofed coronary sinus (also known as coronary sinus defect) is caused by absence of part or all of the common wall between the coronary sinus and the left atrium. This defect accounts for less than 1 percent of ASDs and is commonly associated with a persistent left superior vena cava.\n【15】 GENETIC FACTORS — Most ASDs occur sporadically, though familial transmission has also been identified. Gene mutations causing ASDs have been identified among patients with familial or sporadic disease, including mutations of NKX2.5, causing an autosomal dominant syndrome of ASD with or without conduction defect . Genetic syndromes with skeletal abnormalities associated with ASD include a variety of heart-hand syndromes, which also have autosomal dominant transmission. Holt-Oram syndrome (caused by mutations in the TBX5 gene) is the best known of these heart-hand syndromes.\n【16】 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY — ASDs in adults are associated with left-to-right shunt causing volume overload of the right heart chambers\n【17】 In addition, there is transient right-to-left shunting at the onset of ventricular contraction, particularly under conditions of bradycardia and/or decreased intrathoracic pressure . This explains the possibility of paradoxical embolism in the setting of ASD. Significant right-to-left shunting can develop later in life if severe pulmonary hypertension or tricuspid regurgitation develops.\n【18】 Left atrial enlargement is also seen in adults with ASDs, particularly in patients older than 50 years, with atrial fibrillation, with diastolic dysfunction with elevated left heart filling pressure, or with a primum defect associated with cleft mitral valve and mitral regurgitation.\n【19】 NATURAL HISTORY — The natural course of isolated ASDs varies from spontaneous closure in secundum ASDs to asymptomatic right ventricular enlargement and to increasing symptoms with age. Spontaneous closure of ASDs, noted in approximately 40 percent of secundum ASDs, mostly occurs when ASDs are small, usually less than 8 mm in diameter, and in childhood. Secundum ASDs ≥8 mm in diameter and those in adults do not typically close spontaneously. Primum ASDs, sinus venosus defects, and coronary sinus defects do not close spontaneously.   \"Isolated atrial septal defects (ASDs) in children: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Natural history'.)\n【20】 Increases in left-to-right shunting with age (due to relative increases in the left versus right ventricular end-diastolic pressures), development of systemic hypertension, and other acquired heart disease leading to increased left ventricular end diastolic and/or left atrial pressure, especially in patients with moderate to large ASDs, increase the likelihood of developing symptoms and complications as described in the next section.  'Complications' below.)\n【21】 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS\n【22】 History — Most ASDs occur sporadically, although familial transmission has been observed in a minority of cases. Because of the possibility of familial occurrence, a careful family history should be taken in patients with ASD.\n【23】 The right-sided volume overload in isolated ASDs is usually well tolerated for years despite right heart chamber enlargement n on echocardiography and chest radiograph). It is estimated that most patients with an ASD and significant shunt flow (ie, pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio [Qp:Qs] ≥1.5:1) will become symptomatic and require surgical correction or percutaneous repair by the age of 40 years . However, some patients do not report symptoms until later, likely due to some degree of adaptability to their limitations. In addition, initial symptoms might be mild and nonspecific and therefore ignored . Exercise intolerance, fatigue, and dyspnea are common clinical manifestations of ASDs in adults; some patients develop overt heart failure.\n【24】 In a series of 481 patients with a secundum ASD who were seen between 1957 and 1976 and who underwent surgery before the age of 40, more than one-half had symptoms of dyspnea and fatigue . These symptoms improve after ASD repair .\n【25】 Physical findings — The classic physical findings of an isolated ASD are related to the size and location of the defect, the size of the shunt at atrial level, and the pulmonary arterial pressure.\n【26】 A small minority of patients develop signs of central cyanosis (with blueish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes) due to various causes, as described below.  'Cyanosis' below and 'Eisenmenger syndrome' below.)\n【27】 Precordial palpation — Dilation of the right atrium and RV may initially be undetectable on physical examination. The larger the shunt, the higher the likelihood it will be manifested by one or more of the following findings   \"Examination of the precordial pulsation\", section on 'Palpation'):\n【28】 An enlarged and hyperdynamic RV can produce a right ventricular heave that is most pronounced along the left sternal border and in the subxiphoid area. It can also cause chest wall deformity with asymmetry and a left precordial bulge.\n【29】 Enlargement of the pulmonary artery may be associated with a palpable pulmonary artery impulse at the left upper sternal border. This may be more pronounced in patients with pulmonary hypertension.\n【30】 Auscultation\n【31】 General ASD findings\n【32】 Heart sounds\n【33】 Heart murmurs – The shunt flow across the ASD has too low a velocity and produces too little turbulence to be audible, although it can be demonstrated by phonocardiography. However, several other murmurs may be heard.   \"Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults\".)\n【34】 With pulmonary hypertension — Right-to-left shunting due to pulmonary hypertension in the occasional patient with an ASD may be associated with the following auscultatory findings  'Pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome' below):\n【35】 A right ventricular fourth heart sound\n【36】 A midsystolic ejection click\n【37】 A midsystolic pulmonic murmur that is softer and shorter because the ejected stroke volume is less\n【38】 Increased intensity of the pulmonic component of S2, but no fixed splitting\n【39】 A pulmonic regurgitation murmur, if present, is high-pitched\n【40】 A holosystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation may result from right ventricular and atrial enlargement\n【41】 Eisenmenger syndrome — The development of Eisenmenger physiology is accompanied by cyanosis and clubbing in addition to the auscultatory features of pulmonary hypertension described above. As the disease progresses, features of right ventricular failure (including elevated jugular venous pressure, hepatic congestion, tricuspid regurgitation, and pedal edema) are noted.  'Pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome' below and  \"Pulmonary hypertension with congenital heart disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\".)\n【42】 Complications — Complications in patients with ASDs include atrial arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension (including Eisenmenger syndrome), cyanosis, and paradoxical embolism.\n【43】 Atrial arrhythmias — Atrial arrhythmias (particularly atrial fibrillation, but also atrial flutter and other supraventricular tachycardias) occur commonly with ASDs beyond the third decade. These arrhythmias may cause palpitations and dyspnea and increase the risk of cardioembolic events. In three series with a total of over 600 patients, atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter was present in almost 20 percent overall . The risk of atrial arrhythmias increases with increasing age and pulmonary artery pressure . In a report of 211 adults, the incidence of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter prior to surgery was 1 percent for those aged 18 to 40, 30 percent for those aged 40 to 60, and 80 percent in those over the age of 60 years .  'Electrocardiogram' below.)\n【44】 Pulmonary hypertension and Eisenmenger syndrome — The normal pulmonary vasculature accommodates the increased volume flow in patients with an ASD by recruitment of previously underperfused vessels. As a result, pulmonary artery pressures do not rise significantly unless the volume of pulmonary blood flow exceeds 2.5 times baseline. The development of pulmonary vascular injury is related to the degree and duration of right heart volume overload.   \"The epidemiology and pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (Group 1)\", section on 'Congenital heart disease'.)\n【45】 Moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension is relatively uncommon in patients with an ASD, being present in less than 10 percent of adults at the time of diagnosis . Patients with a sinus venosus defect have higher pulmonary artery pressures and resistances and develop pulmonary hypertension at an earlier age compared with patients with other forms of ASD. The presence of partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection in association with sinus venosus ASD increases the severity of the shunt and may contribute to the increased risk of pulmonary hypertension. In a study of 169 patients, pulmonary hypertension was present in 26 percent of those with a sinus venosus defect compared with 9 percent with an isolated secundum ASD; elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was present in 16 and 4 percent, respectively . The differences in pulmonary artery pressures between patients with sinus venosus and secundum ASDs remained when patients were stratified by age.\n【46】 The development of irreversible pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger syndrome with reversal of the shunt and associated cyanosis is now uncommon because of earlier identification and appropriate surgical or percutaneous correction of the defect. The prognosis is poor once Eisenmenger physiology has been established but has improved significantly compared with the 1960s due to advanced therapeutic options.   \"Pulmonary hypertension with congenital heart disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\".)\n【47】 The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension and the effect of ASD repair were evaluated in a retrospective study of 179 consecutive adults over the age of 40 years . Among these patients, 26 percent had mild to moderate pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure 40 to 60 mmHg), 7 percent had severe pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 60 mmHg), and 2 percent had a marked elevation in PVR indicative of severe pulmonary vascular obstructive disease . Multivariate analysis showed that pulmonary artery systolic pressure >40 mmHg, Qp:Qs >2.5:1, and New York Heart Association functional class III or IV were significant risk factors for mortality, while surgical treatment was associated with reduced mortality. However, surgical treatment is appropriate only in patients without severe pulmonary hypertension. Management of patients with ASD with pulmonary hypertension is discussed separately.   \"Surgical and percutaneous closure of atrial septal defects in adults\".)\n【48】 Cyanosis — Cyanosis in patients with ASDs is usually associated with either concomitant pulmonary valve stenosis resulting in elevated right heart pressures, and thus right-to-left shunt, or Eisenmenger syndrome\n【49】 Cyanosis due to right-to-left shunting across an ASD is uncommon in the absence of pulmonary hypertension or elevated right atrial pressure. Rarely, a prominent Eustachian valve may direct unoxygenated blood from the vena cava across the ASD to the left atrium, leading to the orthodeoxia-platypnea syndrome , as discussed separately.   \"Patent foramen ovale\", section on 'Platypnea-orthodeoxia syndrome'.)\n【50】 Paradoxical embolization — Patients with a patent foramen ovale or, much less often, an ASD, are at risk for stroke due to paradoxical embolization (stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral emboli) . This issue is discussed in detail separately.   \"Atrial septal abnormalities (PFO, ASD, and ASA) and risk of cerebral emboli in adults\".)\n【51】 Initial tests\n【52】 Electrocardiogram — An electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely performed in patients with a suspected ASD. The ECG may be normal with an uncomplicated small ASD. Most individuals with an ASD have normal sinus rhythm, but atrial arrhythmias often occur in adults.  'Atrial arrhythmias' above.)\n【53】 The frontal plane QRS axis often ranges from +95 to +135° (right axis deviation) with a clockwise loop. A northwest (right superior) QRS axis (an axis from -90 to ±180°) usually suggests the presence of an AV canal defect.\n【54】 P waves are typically normal with secundum ASDs. In comparison, sinus venosus defects are often associated with a leftward frontal plane P-wave axis (ie, negative in leads III and aVF and positive in lead aVL) . This leftward shift is caused by an ectopic pacemaker resulting from an ASD located near the sinus node.\n【55】 First-degree AV block can occur in any type of ASD but is classically present in ostium primum defects in association with complete right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block. The rim of the ostium primum defect is in close spatial relationship to the His bundle, accounting for abnormalities of impulse conduction through this area.\n【56】 The QRS complex is often slightly prolonged and has a characteristic rSr' or rsR' pattern that is thought to result from disproportionate thickening of the right ventricular outflow tract, which is the last portion of the ventricle to depolarize. Patients with increasing severity of pulmonary hypertension tend to lose the rSr' pattern in V1 and develop a tall monophasic R wave with a deeply inverted T wave as right ventricular hypertrophy develops.\n【57】 A notch on the R wave in the inferior leads (a pattern called \"crochetage\") has also been suggested as a sensitive and specific ECG sign of secundum ASD (waveform 1). In one report, this finding was present in 73 percent of patients with a secundum ASD versus 7.4 percent of normal subjects, 36 percent of patients with ventricular septal defects, and 23 percent of patients with pulmonic stenosis . Among patients with an ASD, its frequency correlates with the size of the defect and the degree of left-to-right shunt.\n【58】 Chest radiograph — The chest radiograph with an isolated ASD reflects the dilation of the right atrium, RV, and pulmonary arteries. Left atrial enlargement may be .\n【59】 In comparison to these classic findings, the radiographic appearance in patients diagnosed at a later age may be atypical, especially in presence of acquired cardiovascular diseases. The atypical findings include normal vasculature, evidence of pulmonary venous hypertension, left atrial enlargement, and pulmonary edema . In one study, atypical findings were more common in patients over the age of 50 (30 versus 6 percent in younger subjects) .\n【60】 Transthoracic echocardiogram — Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), often using agitated saline contrast if the defect is not readily apparent, is the primary test for the diagnosis of ASDs. Use of echocardiography and other tests to identify ASDs and associated lesions is discussed below.  'Echocardiography' below.)\n【61】 DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION\n【62】 When to suspect an ASD — Patients with a systolic murmur at the left sternal border associated with fixed splitting of the second heart sounds, unexplained right ventricular volume overload, atrial arrhythmias, or pulmonary hypertension should be referred for evaluation of possible ASD and/or partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection . Diagnosis is important given the potential benefit of timely repair.\n【63】 Approach to diagnosis and evaluation — The diagnosis and evaluation of an ASD includes demonstration of the presence, location, size, and direction of the shunt, as well as evaluation of any associated cardiac lesions and complications including RV volume overload, pulmonary hypertension, and arrhythmias . The Qp:Qs should be assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) or cardiac catheterization if the cause of right ventricular volume overload is uncertain. This information is used to determine whether ASD closure is indicated and candidacy for device closure.   \"Management of atrial septal defects in adults\".)\n【64】 Identification of ASD and associated anomalies\n【65】 Evaluation of RV volume overload – Echocardiography is the primary means of assessment of RV size and function. RV volume overload is suggested by RV enlargement with diastolic flattening of the interventricular septum. The pulmonary arteries may also be dilated. If the echocardiogram is technically suboptimal or indeterminate, RV overload can be assessed using CMR or CT imaging.   \"Echocardiographic assessment of the right heart\" and  \"Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging\".)\n【66】 Evaluation of pulmonary artery pressure – Pulmonary pressures should be assessed in all patients with ASDs. RV and pulmonary artery systolic pressures are estimated using Doppler echocardiography by obtaining the peak tricuspid regurgitation continuous-wave Doppler signal, using the modified Bernoulli equation, and adding the estimated right atrial pressure . RV volume overload is suggested by diastolic flattening of the interventricular septum. RV pressure overload is suggested by systolic (or systolic and diastolic) flattening of the interventricular septum.  'Associated findings' below and  \"Echocardiographic assessment of the right heart\".)\n【67】 Indications for invasive cardiac catheterization to assess pulmonary artery pressures include an inconclusive noninvasive evaluation or features of severe pulmonary hypertension and are described below.  'Cardiac catheterization' below.)\n【68】 Estimation of Qp:Qs - Estimation of the pulmonary blood flow to systemic blood flow (Qp:Qs) ratio is helpful in cases in which the cause of right atrial and RV chamber enlargement is uncertain and in cases in which the degree of shunt may help determine whether intervention would be beneficial.\n【69】 Arrhythmia evaluation – Since atrial arrhythmias are common in adults with ASDs, these are assessed by electrocardiography. Longer-term monitoring (eg, by ambulatory cardiac monitoring, such as a Holter or longer-duration monitor) may be used to identify intermittent arrhythmias.   \"Atrial fibrillation: Overview and management of new-onset atrial fibrillation\", section on 'Evaluation'.)\n【70】 Key tests\n【71】 Echocardiography — Echocardiography is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis of ASDs, as it generally identifies and characterizes the ASD as well as associated abnormalities and complications. Since the sensitivity of echocardiography varies with technology, acoustic windows, and operator/patient factors, negative suboptimal or noncomprehensive echocardiograms do not exclude an ASD.\n【72】 Transthoracic echocardiography — A comprehensive TTE includes two-dimensional imaging as well as color flow, pulsed-wave, and continuous-wave Doppler to determine the presence, size, location, flow characteristics, and hemodynamic effects of the ASD as well as associated lesions (movie 2A).\n【73】 ASD and associated flow — TTE is usually diagnostic for secundum and primum ASDs when a complete examination (including multiple precordial windows) is performed by a trained sonographer/imager, unless the shunt is very small or images are technically suboptimal. Clues to the presence of a secundum or primum defect include abrupt discontinuity or drop out of the interatrial septum. Hypermobility of the septum, particularly in association with an abrupt discontinuity, is also suggestive of secundum defect. TTE may also detect unroofed coronary sinus defects.\n【74】 The interatrial septum is often best visualized in the subcostal view in which the ultrasound beam is generally nearly perpendicular to the atrial septum . However, this view is suboptimal in some individuals, particularly in obese subjects. Off-axis apical, parasternal short axis, and other nonstandard views are frequently necessary to interrogate the whole interatrial septum.\n【75】 The diagnostic sensitivity of two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging using the subcostal approach was evaluated in a review of 154 patients (mean age 31 years) with a documented ASD (105 secundum, 32 primum, and 16 sinus venosus) in whom a satisfactory image of the atrial septum could be obtained by TTE . The defect was successfully visualized in 89 percent of secundum ASDs, 100 percent of primum ASDs, and only 44 percent of sinus venosus ASDs. Contrast echocardiography using peripheral vein injection of agitated saline, when performed, identified all defects missed by two-dimensional TTE.\n【76】 The interatrial septum may also be visualized in the apical four-chamber view, but this view should generally not be relied upon given the risk of artifactual echo dropout (low signal) as the ultrasound beam may be parallel to the atrial septum in this view.\n【77】 The size of an ASD on two-dimensional TTE does not correlate well with shunt flow measured at catheterization. ASD size is better assessed with color flow (movie 2A) and pulsed-wave Doppler or three-dimensional TTE or TEE imaging. The addition of color flow Doppler imaging can help identify or confirm the presence of an ASD and indicate the overall direction of the flow across the atrial septum (movie 2A-B). Reducing the Nyquist limit (the upper limit of velocity that can be detected with a given Doppler pulse frequency) may enable detection of the turbulent shunt flow.\n【78】 There are several limitations to color flow Doppler echocardiography in the diagnosis of ASD:\n【79】 Ghosting of color across the interatrial septum sometimes gives the false impression of shunt flow (in particular with apical imaging).\n【80】 An ASD can be missed by TTE when there is associated severe pulmonary hypertension as the latter reduces the shunt flow across the ASD. In this setting, agitated saline injection or TEE should be considered.\n【81】 Unusual ASD location is another possible cause for missing an ASD; specifically, the sinus venosus and coronary sinus ASDs should be sought when no ASD is readily identified. Sinus venosus defects that are high or low in the septum ; TTE with agitated saline contrast or TEE can identify nearly all of these patients .\n【82】 Three-dimensional echocardiography (TTE or TEE) can facilitate precise sizing of ASDs and provide information that may be important for treatment (eg, transcatheter closure), such as the shape of the ASD and its relationship to atrial superior and inferior limbic band tissue, the aortic root, and the AV valves .   \"Three-dimensional echocardiography\".)\n【83】 Use of agitated saline contrast in select cases is described below.  'Agitated saline contrast' below.)\n【84】 Associated findings — Since initial imaging of the interatrial septum may be inconclusive, other evidence of ASD such as right atrial and ventricular enlargement due to volume overload (ie, diastolic interventricular septal flattening and increased pulmonary artery velocities without anatomic stenosis) and pulmonary artery dilatation should be sought. Continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography is used to estimate the RV and (thus indirectly) pulmonary artery systolic pressures.  'Approach to diagnosis and evaluation' above and  \"Echocardiographic assessment of the right heart\", section on 'Pulmonary artery pressure'.)\n【85】 In addition, associated congenital lesions should be sought:\n【86】 Primum ASDs are generally accompanied by cleft anterior mitral valve leaflet and, less commonly, tricuspid valve, ventricular septal, and left ventricular outflow tract abnormalities.\n【87】 Unroofed coronary sinus is commonly accompanied by persistent left superior vena cava.\n【88】 Partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (primarily of the right upper and middle pulmonary veins) frequently accompanies superior sinus venosus defects and less frequently occurs with secundum ASDs .   \"Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return\".)\n【89】 Agitated saline contrast — If comprehensive TTE with two-dimensional and color Doppler imaging is not conclusive for ASD, imaging following agitated saline contrast injection in a peripheral vein at rest and with one or more maneuvers (Valsalva or cough) is helpful to confirm the diagnosis . Agitated saline contrast can be performed with TTE or TEE imaging (movie 3).\n【90】 Contrast injection can be via any peripheral vein, but a left upper extremity injection site is required to assess persistent left superior vena cava (commonly associated with unroofed coronary sinus). The presence of unroofed coronary sinus with persistent left superior vena cava is identified after intravenous agitated saline injection in the left arm by detection of contrast in the left atrium before or simultaneous to the right atrium.\n【91】 An adequate contrast injection causes opacification of the right atrium and ventricle. If there is a right-to-left interatrial shunt (transient or net), early appearance of contrast can be\n【92】 A right-to-left interatrial shunt can be detected by contrast echocardiography in three circumstances:\n【93】 Patent foramen ovale, with no or net left-to-right shunt, with transient elevation in right atrial pressure above left atrial pressure (generally timed during the end of the T wave) (movie 5).   \"Patent foramen ovale\".)\n【94】 With an uncomplicated ASD with net left-to-right shunt, when flow is temporarily reversed with transient increases in right atrial pressure relative to left atrial pressure (eg, with a Valsalva maneuver or coughing) or briefly during the onset of left ventricular contraction (movie 3 and movie 6).\n【95】 With an ASD complicated by severe pulmonary hypertension with reversal of shunting across the ASD.\n【96】 Agitated saline contrast echocardiography may also be used in the detection of a left-to-right shunt. However, negative contrast in the right atrium is an insensitive and nonspecific sign of left-to-right interatrial shunting  as flow from the contrast-free left atrium produces areas in the right atrium in which contrast is not seen. Care must be taken to distinguish this finding from lack of contrast opacification of the right atrium due to streaming of blood from vena cava inflow.\n【97】 Transesophageal echocardiography — TEE is superior to TTE for imaging the interatrial septum and pulmonary veins and is often used when a definitive diagnosis is not made by TTE due to indeterminate findings or technically suboptimal images (eg, in patients with chest wall deformities, lung disease, or other causes for poor acoustic windows).\n【98】 TEE is highly accurate for the diagnosis of all types of septal defects (movie 1) in the hands of an experienced operator. It is particularly helpful for detection of sinus venosus defects, which are often missed with TTE . When performed with color flow Doppler, preferably with agitated saline contrast study, TEE can detect right-to-left shunting when there is transient reversal of flow through the ASD when right-sided pressure is increased (eg, with a Valsalva maneuver) or briefly during the onset of left ventricular contraction (movie 3 and movie 7). TEE is also more sensitive than TTE for the detection of left-to-right shunting as negative right atrial contrast (93 versus 58 percent in one report) . TEE can also detect flow through multiple ASDs (movie 4).\n【99】 Estimation of ASD size using the diameter of the Doppler color flow jet on TEE or three-dimensional TEE imaging generally correlates well with direct measurement at the time of surgery or balloon measurement at the time of percutaneous device placement .\n【100】 TEE is also helpful in identification of PAPVC, especially connection to the superior vena cava. However, other types of PAPVC are better seen on TTE. Anomalous venous connection to the superior or inferior vena cava may be beyond the TTE/TEE imaging plane . In this setting, CMR or CT should be used to define the anatomy of the anomalous venous connections.\n【101】 CMR and CT — CMR and cardiac CT imaging can identify and characterize ASDs (including sinus venosus defect and unroofed coronary sinus, which might not be well characterized by echocardiography), identify and characterize PAPVC , and also estimate shunt flow (both by volumetric assessment and by direct flow measurements). Quantification of left-to-right shunting by CMR correlates well with shunt flow calculation based upon cardiac catheterization (invasive oximetry) with a small but not clinically significant overestimation of Qp:Qs by CMR . Since ASDs can be diagnosed and treated based on noninvasive evaluation including CMR, there is only occasionally the need for cardiac catheterization.   \"Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging\".)\n【102】 Cardiac catheterization — Invasive cardiac catheterization is rarely required for diagnosis of ASDs since the evaluation can generally be performed using noninvasive means. Determination of the presence of an ASD by catheterization involves sampling of the oxygen content at multiple sites described below; a \"step-up\" in oxygen saturation is indicative of a left-to-right shunt.   \"Pulmonary artery catheterization: Interpretation of hemodynamic values and waveforms in adults\", section on 'Detection of left-to-right shunts'.)\n【103】 Cineangiography is rarely required to identify an ASD. When performed, optimal direct visualization of left-to-right shunting through an ASD is achieved by an injection of contrast just outside the orifice of the right upper pulmonary vein in the cranially angulated left anterior oblique projection (also known as the four-chamber view). With this view, secundum ASDs are seen in the middle of the atrial septum, and sinus venous and AV canal defects are seen at the superior and inferior aspect of the atrial septum, respectively.\n【104】 Indications for cardiac catheterization in the evaluation of ASD include the following:\n【105】 Inconclusive assessment of left-to-right shunt severity (ie, uncertain if hemodynamically significant, which is defined as causing right atrial and/or right ventricular enlargement with a Qp:Qs ≥1.5:1) by noninvasive means (echocardiography and CMR).\n【106】 If significant pulmonary hypertension is suspected (pulmonary artery systolic pressure ≥50 percent of systemic systolic arterial pressure or pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) ≥ one-third of systemic vascular resistance, and with no cyanosis at rest or during exercise), cardiac catheterization is indicated to measure pulmonary artery pressures, determine PVR, and assess reversibility with vasodilators, as this is important in determining whether defect closure is indicated .   \"Management of atrial septal defects in adults\", section on 'ASD closure' and  \"Pulmonary hypertension with congenital heart disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\", section on 'Diagnosis and evaluation'.)\n【107】 Assessment of left ventricular diastolic function, especially in adults with hypertension and other risk factors for elevated left ventricular diastolic pressure.\n【108】 Device closure of secundum ASD.\n【109】 When required, a formal \"shunt run\" at cardiac catheterization measures the oxygen content in the blood at multiple sites, and the Fick equation is then used to calculate the Qp:Qs ratio\n【110】 The sequence of steps in this determination is as follows:\n【111】 The \"shunt run\" is performed, measuring oxygen saturation in the inferior vena cava (IVC), superior vena cava (SVC), right atrium, RV, and pulmonary artery (PA). Accurate catheter position during this procedure is essential. Mixed venous oxygen saturation (MvO2) can then be calculated as follows:\n【112】 The SVC oxygen saturation is multiplied by three because SVC flow is approximately three times IVC flow.\n【113】 Systemic arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) is measured by arterial blood gas analysis or by pulse oximetry.   \"Pulse oximetry\".)\n【114】 O2 consumption is determined (this assessment should be based upon direct measurement, rather than assumed from available nomograms). This measurement requires substantial patient cooperation.   \"Oxygen delivery and consumption\".)\n【115】 The patient's blood hemoglobin (Hb) concentration is obtained from a complete blood count or blood gas analysis.\n【116】 The systemic blood flow (Qs) is calculated from the Fick equation :\n【117】 The pulmonary blood flow (Qp) is also calculated from the Fick equation :\n【118】 This calculation requires a value for the pulmonary venous O2 saturation, which is not usually measured directly (although a catheter can be inserted across the ASD and into the pulmonary veins). If the SaO2 is above 95 percent, it may be used as an approximation of the pulmonary venous measurement.\n【119】 If the SaO2 is less than 95 percent, a right-to-left shunt may be present and must be excluded by contrast echocardiography or other means. An SaO2 of less than 95 percent not due to a right-to-left shunt (eg, due to chronic lung disease) should be used as the accurate estimate of the pulmonary venous O2 saturation. If a right-to-left shunt is present, an assumed value of 98 percent for the pulmonary venous O2 saturation is used.\n【120】 If there is no evidence of an associated right-to-left shunt, the volume of the left-to-right shunt is determined from the Qp:Qs. More complex calculations are required to determine shunt volume in the presence of bidirectional shunting.\n【121】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Congenital heart disease in adults\".)\n【122】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on \"patient info\" and the keyword(s) of interest.)\n【123】 Basics topics   \"\n【124】 An atrial septal defect (ASD) is a defect in the atrial septum and is classified by type based upon location including secundum ASD, primum ASD, superior sinus venosus defect, inferior sinus venosus defect, and unroofed coronary sinus\n【125】 ASDs are associated with left-to-right shunt which causes volume overload of the right heart chambers\n【126】 Most patients with an ASD and significant shunt flow (ie, pulmonary to systemic flow ≥1.5:1) will be symptomatic (with atrial arrhythmias, exercise intolerance, fatigue, dyspnea, and heart failure) and require closure by the age of 40. However, some patients do not become symptomatic until 60 years of age or older.  'History' above.)\n【127】 The characteristic physical findings with an ASD with large left-to-right shunt and normal pulmonary artery pressures are a right ventricular heave, wide, fixed splitting of the second sound (S2), and pulmonary outflow murmur due to increased volume of flow across the pulmonary valve.  'Physical findings' above.)\n【128】 Patients with a systolic murmur at the left sternal border associated with fixed splitting of the second heart sounds, unexplained right ventricular volume overload, or pulmonary hypertension should be referred for evaluation of possible ASD and/or partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection.

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can be definitive for ostium secundum and primum defects.

This review first explores the ubiquity of exposure of children to television and media violence, then reviews studies that have established the negative consequences of this exposure, and concludes with suggestions for clinical interventions. Much of the research reviewed was conducted in the 1980s and 1990s, when the influence of media exposure on children was first established. Since then, the variety of media available has exploded, although there is no reason to believe that the exposure to media violence has decreased.\n【2】 The association between viewing violence and subsequent violent behavior and prevention of the consequences of media violence are reviewed here. Other types of violence are discussed separately:\n【3】 Movies are another source of violent content, and viewing gun use in movies may increase interest in guns in the real world . In a review of 77 movies from 1999 and 2000 that were rated PG-13, nearly 90 percent had violent content, and firearms were used in nearly one-third . Overall, 2251 acts of violence were observed, 47 percent of which were of lethal magnitude. Seven movies contained more than 100 acts of violence. In another review of 61 G- and PG-rated movies released between 1998 and 2002, 28 percent included characters with guns, 48 percent depicted gun threats, and guns were discharged in 15 percent . However, the consequences of gun use (injury and death) were rarely portrayed. Depictions of gun violence in the top grossing PG-13-rated films have increased since 1985, and since 2009 have been as frequent or more frequent than in the top-grossing R-rated films . A survey of 6522 United States adolescents aged 10 to 14 years in 2003 indicated that 12.5 percent had\n【4】 Music videos and video games are additional sources of violent content. In a review of 518 music videos broadcast on television, 462 acts of overt interpersonal violence were portrayed . Content analysis of 81 randomly selected video games for teenagers found that 98 percent involved intentional violence, 90 percent rewarded or required the player to injure other characters, and 69 percent rewarded or required the player to kill . However, the data associating video game use with actual violent behavior remain controversial . A 2016 statement from the American Academy of Pediatrics Council on Communications advises that most experts in the field agree on the potential harms of exposure to all forms of screen violence and states that \"first-person shooter games, in which killing others is the central theme, are not appropriate for any children\" .\n【5】 The average American child who spends two-thirds of his or her television time watching prime-time television programs and one-third watching cartoons views 10,000 to 12,000 violent acts per year . American children see an estimated 8000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence by the time they finish grade school and twice that many by the time they reach 20 years of age .\n【6】 A random survey of 1051 families conducted in 2005 by the Kaiser Family Foundation demonstrated the continued early and consistent use of television by American families. Over 40 percent of infants less than one year old watch television daily; this proportion climbs to 80 percent by age two years . More recent survey data indicate that regular screen use is initiated at age four months, and children younger than two years average over one hour of screen time daily . In a 2020 report, 35 percent of three- to five-year-old children had their own smart phone or tablet, and average daily use was nearly two hours .\n【7】 The specificity of the association is supported by experimental studies demonstrating an association between reduced television viewing and reduced aggression in school-age children . In addition, in a randomized trial, preschool children whose caregivers were encouraged to substitute high-quality/educational programming for aggression-laden programming (without reducing total screen time) and to watch the programs with their children for six months had a higher mean Social Competence and Behavior Evaluation score . Finally, in observational studies, use of violent video games has been associated with a rise in salivary cortisol levels, as well as aggressive behavior .\n【8】 Support for this explanation comes from an early experimental study of preschool children who were shown one of three versions of a short film in which an actor hits and kicks a clown doll . In the first version, the film ends after the violence; in the second, the actor is rewarded after the attack; and in the third, the actor is punished after the attack. The children were led to a room containing an identical clown doll after they viewed the film. The children who saw the first and second versions of the film tended to attack the doll in the same way that the actor had. The children who saw the third version did not attack the doll as often.\n【9】 Additional support is provided by comparison of the portrayal of violence in American and Japanese television. In Japan, where violence more often is perpetrated by the villain and the consequences of violence (eg, suffering for the hero) are emphasized, society is less violent than in the United States .\n【10】 The normalization of and desensitization to violence has three effects :\n【11】 Children who are exposed repeatedly to media violence accept violence as a normal part of life and a way to solve problems. They learn that objecting to violence may lead to more serious violence. They may resign themselves to violence, fail to seek help, and become more susceptible to becoming victims. Bystanders who feel that physical violence is a normal part of life encourage others to fight or refrain from intervening to prevent a fight . In contrast, when children learn sanctions against aggression, aggressive behavior decreases .\n【12】 The effect on individuals is influenced by temperamental and environmental variables . Children who identify with violent media characters are likely to use aggression in their lives . To the extent that children who witness aggressive solutions to interpersonal problems identify with the aggressive character, they fantasize about the aggressive behavior and remember the aggressive characters that they observe. The aggressive behavior then becomes habitual and interferes with social and academic success, leading to more regular television viewing, thus perpetuating a cycle of aggression, academic and social failure, violence viewing, and aggressive fantasizing.\n【13】 Caregivers may be able to mitigate the negative effects of childhood media use. In a meta-analysis of observational studies, watching media with children and discussing the content (\"active monitoring\") was associated with decreased aggression, whereas simple media restriction was not . In a subsequent cross-sectional survey of children age 10 to 18 years, active monitoring that supported the child's autonomy was associated with less aggression .\n【14】 Repeated exposure to television violence produces subtle shifts in how adult Americans view the world and contributes to a pessimistic perspective. Adults who watch large amounts of television are more likely to view the world with feelings of danger, mistrust, intolerance, gloom, and hopelessness than do adults with less television exposure . Similar results are found in preschool children .This pessimistic world view has implications for policy making and individual actions. As an example, more Americans now own handguns than did in the past, despite the well-documented increased personal risk of injury or death associated with handgun ownership and the decline in the overall rate of violent crime .\n【15】 Additional studies have focused on the use of violent video games. In addition to the passive effects of witnessing violence, video games enlist the user in the active roleplay of violent actions. Studies of the effects of violent video games on aggressive behavior have inconsistent findings. In a randomized trial, children who played or watched violent video games were more likely to touch a disabled handgun and to shoot at themselves or others . One meta-analysis of observational studies evaluating the effects of violent video games concluded: \"The evidence strongly suggests that exposure to violent video games is a causal risk factor for increased aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, and for decreased empathy and prosocial behavior\" . However, a subsequent meta-analysis of observational studies argued that the effect size is minimal after appropriately controlling for covariates and, in particular, called on experts to refrain from blaming mass shootings on video game use .\n【16】 The television/media history has three main questions:\n【17】 Caregivers should be educated about the adverse consequences of television/media use (eg, exposure to violence, obesity, and decreased school achievement)  and then advised about ways to decrease the exposure and the effects of media violence. Specific and efficient advice maximizes the effect :\n【18】 Medical care settings should set an example for the above recommendations . Reading programs using volunteers should be implemented in waiting rooms and inpatient units. Televisions in hospitals, offices, and clinic waiting areas should be tuned to nonviolent programming and display a sign that says: \"This television is tuned to a public television channel so that children can watch nonviolent shows.\"\n【19】 Pediatric care providers should be aware of policies and proposed policy changes in government and industry regulation and should try to focus their advocacy efforts on simple measures that do not impinge on the First Amendment rights of broadcasters. Pediatric care providers should work with the entertainment industry to encourage responsible programming and compliance with the major broadcast networks' standards regarding television violence. These standards proscribe :\n【20】 In addition, the standards urge that the consequences of televised violence be portrayed and that portrayals of callousness or indifference to suffering experienced by the victims of violence be avoided.\n【21】 The Children's Television Act of 1990 and the Revision of Programming Policies for Television Broadcast Stations called for an increase in the quality of children's programming . In the past, broadcasters were required to air educational and informational programming at least three hours per week, to limit the amount of advertising during children's programming, and to label the shows E/I (educational and informational) on the screen. These regulations were substantially relaxed in 2019 . Pediatric advocates can use the provisions of these acts to work with their local broadcast stations to develop violence-free programming .\n【22】 The Telecommunications Act of 1996 gave the broadcasting industry an opportunity to establish voluntary ratings for programming that contains sexual, violent, or other content that caregivers may consider inappropriate for children . Although caregiver and industry raters may disagree on what is appropriate viewing for children of various ages , the rating system is a first step in helping caregivers choose programming for their children. The rating system and the \"v-chip\" enable caregivers to prevent certain programming from entering their homes.\n【23】 The United States Federal Communications Commission has adopted rules requiring all new television sets with screens larger than 33 cm to be equipped with v-chips. However, reports indicate that less than half of purchasers of these televisions are aware of the v-chip, and only a tiny minority use them . So, for the time being, caregiver, rather than electronic, controls will mediate the exposure of children to television violence.\n", "title": "Television and media violence", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/television-and-media-violence?search=%E9%80%9A%E8%BF%87%E6%9A%B4%E9%9C%B2%E4%BA%8E%E8%92%B8%E6%B0%94%E3%80%81%E7%83%AD%E6%B0%B4%E8%92%B8%E6%B0%94%E3%80%81%E7%83%AD%E7%A9%BA%E6%B0%94%E6%88%96%E7%83%AD%E6%B0%94%E4%BD%93%E7%9A%84%E6%95%85%E6%84%8F%E8%87%AA%E5%AE%B3&source=search_result&selectedTitle=131%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:51", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:09:34"}

Use proper injection technique for vaccines administered in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Cross 2016; Foster 2013).\n【52】 Syncope: Syncope has been reported with use of injectable vaccines and may result in serious secondary injury (eg, skull fracture, cerebral hemorrhage); typically reported in adolescents and young adults and within 15 minutes after vaccination. Procedures should be in place to avoid injuries from falling and to restore cerebral perfusion if syncope occurs (ACIP [Kroger 2023]).\n【53】 Acute illness: The decision to administer or delay vaccination because of current or recent febrile illness depends on the severity of symptoms and the etiology of the disease. In general, it is recommended to defer vaccine administration in patients with moderate or severe acute febrile illness (with or without fever) and to provide vaccination in patients with mild acute illness (with or without fever) (ACIP [Kroger 2023]). Although not included in the Pfizer or Moderna documentation from the FDA, the Canadian product information for the Pfizer vaccine recommends postponing vaccination in patients with acute severe febrile illness. In addition, the Canadian product information for the Moderna vaccine states to consider postponing vaccination in patients with acute severe febrile illness or severe acute infection.\n【54】 Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders (including thrombocytopenia); bleeding or hematoma may occur from IM administration; if the patient receives antihemophilia or other similar therapy, IM injection can be scheduled shortly after such therapy is administered (ACIP [Kroger 2023]). For more information on administering the COVID-19 vaccine in patients with bleeding disorders, .\n【55】 Multisystem inflammatory syndrome: In patients with a history of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS), it is typically recommended to delay COVID-19 vaccination until clinical recovery from MIS and until ≥90 days after diagnosis. Data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccination following MIS in children (MIS-C) or MIS in adults (MIS-A) are limited; risks and benefits should be weighed with consideration given to patient-specific factors (eg, recovery from illness [including return to baseline cardiac function], risk of severe COVID-19). In patients who developed MIS within 90 days following a dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, subsequent doses should be deferred, but may be offered on a case-by-case basis per provider discretion. In patients who developed MIS ≥90 days after a previous dose of COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, subsequent doses should be considered ≥90 days after MIS diagnosis for patients who have clinically recovered (including return to baseline cardiac function) (CDC 2023).\n【56】 Myocarditis/pericarditis (CDC 2023):\n【57】 - Persons who experience myocarditis/pericarditis after a dose of the vaccine: For persons who developed myocarditis or pericarditis after any dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, subsequent doses of any COVID-19 vaccine are generally not recommended. If after risk assessment a decision is made to administer subsequent dose(s), wait until complete resolution of signs/symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis with no evidence of ongoing heart inflammation or sequelae as determined by clinical team.\n【58】 - Persons with history of myocarditis or pericarditis prior to vaccination: Persons with history of myocarditis or pericarditis unrelated to COVID-19 vaccination may receive any FDA-approved or FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine after complete resolution of signs/symptoms of myocarditis or pericarditis with no evidence of ongoing heart inflammation or sequelae as determined by clinical team.\n【59】 SARS-CoV-2 infection or exposure (CDC 2023):\n【60】 - Persons with history of COVID-19 or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection: Vaccination is recommended for everyone ≥6 months of age, regardless of history of symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Persons who recently had SARS-CoV-2 infection may consider delaying vaccine doses by 3 months from symptom onset or positive test (if asymptomatic); increased time between infection and vaccination may improve vaccination immune response.\n【61】 - Persons who received passive antibody COVID-19 therapy: Vaccination does not need to be delayed for persons who previously received COVID-19 monoclonal antibody therapy or convalescent plasma (postexposure prophylaxis or treatment).\n【62】 Anticoagulant therapy: Clinicians administering vaccine should be aware of potential bleeding or hematoma that could occur due to IM administration (ACIP [Kroger 2023]).\n【63】 Medications for postvaccination adverse reactions: Antipyretic or analgesic medications (eg, acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may be taken for the treatment of postvaccination local/systemic symptoms (if medically appropriate) but should not be used prophylactically to prevent postvaccination symptoms (CDC 2023).\n【64】 Vaccines: The CDC and American Academy of Pediatrics recommend simultaneous administration of the COVID-19 vaccine with other vaccines or administration in the days before and after receipt of other vaccines (AAP 2022; CDC 2023). Because of the risk for myocarditis and pericarditis related to the COVID-19 vaccine and smallpox vaccine (ACAM2000) and the unknown myocarditis and pericarditis risk related to smallpox and monkeypox vaccine (Jynneos or Imvamune), consider waiting 4 weeks after orthopoxvirus vaccine (ACAM2000; Jynneos or Imvamune) administration before administering a COVID-19 vaccine (especially for adolescent/young adult males). There is no minimum interval after COVID-19 vaccination before orthopoxvirus vaccines may be administered (CDC 2023; CDC/ACIP [Rao 2022]).\n【65】 Traceability: The vaccine name, batch/lot number, expiration date, and other administration details must be recorded for each patient in order to improve traceability.\n【66】 Altered immunocompetence: COVID-19 vaccines can be safely administered to immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV or receiving immunosuppressant therapy) if no contraindications exist; as with the general population, mRNA vaccines are preferred. Immunocompromised persons may have a diminished immune response to the vaccine, but the potential benefit of the vaccine outweighs the uncertainties. If possible, complete COVID-19 vaccination ≥2 weeks prior to initiation or resumption of immunosuppressive therapy (CDC 2023; NACI 2021). For more information on administering the COVID-19 vaccine in specific disease states, .\n【67】 Persons who had received dermal fillers: Temporary swelling at or near the site of filler injection has been infrequently reported after COVID-19 (mRNA) vaccination (CDC 2023).\n【68】 Pediatric: Multiple formulations from both manufacturers (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are available and the ages for which each product is authorized differs. Additionally, the recommended number of doses for some age groups may differ. Use extra caution when selecting formulation, dosage, and preparation prior to administration (ISMP [Smetzer 2022b]).\n【69】 Effective immunity: Vaccination may not result in effective immunity in all patients. Response depends upon multiple factors (eg, type of vaccine, age of patient) (ACIP [Kroger 2023]).\n【70】 Mammograms: Temporary contralateral or ipsilateral lymphadenopathy after a COVID-19 vaccination has been reported. To avoid possible misinterpretation of mammogram screening, mammograms are recommended prior to vaccination or 4 to 6 weeks after the second dose. When this is not possible, the mammogram technologist or radiologist should be informed when and which vaccine was administered, and what arm the injection was given (ACOG 2023). Imaging needed for acute symptoms, or urgent treatment planning or complications, should not be delayed (Becker 2021).\n【71】 Dosage Forms: US\n【72】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Currently, EUAs are used for vaccination in individuals 6 months to <12 years of age. Use in ages ≥12 years has received full approval (no fact sheets are provided).\n【110】 The vaccine provider should include vaccination information in the state/local jurisdiction Immunization Information System (IIS) or other designated system and provide a paper record card as a backup.\n【111】 Administration: Adult\n【112】 Administration: Pediatric\n【113】 Parenteral: IM: Administer IM in the deltoid muscle or anterolateral thigh as appropriate for age (Ref). Use proper injection technique in the deltoid muscle (eg, injecting in the central, thickest part of the muscle) to reduce the risk of shoulder injury related to vaccine administration (Ref). Do not inject intravascularly, SUBQ, or intradermally. To prevent syncope-related injuries, adolescents should be vaccinated while seated or lying down. If administering simultaneously with other vaccines, administer each vaccine at a different injection site (Ref). US recipients or caregivers should be given a vaccination card that includes the name of the vaccine, lot number, the vaccination date, and name of the health care site or person where the vaccine was administered (Ref).\n【114】 Use: Labeled Indications\n【115】 Updated CDC recommendations on the use of the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccines are forthcoming. Current CDC content reflects recommendations from May 2023. The specific number of doses depends on the person's age, COVID-19 vaccination history, immune status, and vaccine product (Ref).\n【116】 Moderate and severe immunocompromising conditions and treatments include but are not limited to (Ref):\n【117】 Active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies\n【118】 Hematologic malignancies associated with poor responses to COVID-19 vaccines (eg, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute leukemia) regardless of current treatment status\n【119】 Receipt of solid-organ or islet transplant and taking immunosuppressive therapy\n【120】 Receipt of CAR-T-cell or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (within 2 years of transplantation or taking immunosuppressive therapy)\n【121】 Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (eg, common variable immunodeficiency disease, severe combined immunodeficiency, DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome)\n【122】 HIV infection (advanced or untreated)\n【123】 Active treatment with any of the following: High-dose corticosteroids (ie, prednisone ≥20 mg/day or equivalent for ≥2 weeks); alkylating agents; antimetabolites, transplant-related immunosuppressive drugs, cancer chemotherapeutic agents classified as severely immunosuppressive, tumor necrosis blockers, and other biologic agents that are immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory.\n【124】 ≥6 months of age (Comirnaty [primary series])\n【125】 ≥6 months of age (Spikevax [primary series])\n【126】 ≥5 years of age (Comirnaty [bivalent booster dose])\n【127】 ≥6 years of age (Spikevax [bivalent booster dose containing SARS-CoV-2 Original strain and Omicron BA.1])\n【128】 ≥18 years of age (Spikevax [bivalent booster dose containing SARS-CoV-2 Original strain and Omicron BA.4/BA.5])\n【129】 Medication Safety Issues\n【130】 Other safety concerns:\n【131】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【132】 None known.\n【133】 Drug Interactions\n【134】 Abatacept: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines. Management: Rheumatology guidelines recommend holding SQ abatacept for 1 to 2 weeks after each vaccine dose and timing vaccine dose so that it is given 1 week prior to the next IV abatacept dose. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【135】 Acetaminophen: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines. Management: Consider avoiding routine prophylactic use of acetaminophen before or during vaccine administration when possible. Acetaminophen is still recommended to treat fevers and/or pain that occurs after vaccination. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【136】 Anti-CD20 B-Cell Depleting Therapies: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines. Management: Administer COVID-19 vaccine 2 to 4 weeks prior to the next scheduled dose of anti-CD20 therapy, if used chronically for the treatment of autoimmune disease. Revaccinate 6 months after completion of anti-CD20 therapy if used over a limited period. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【137】 Apremilast: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines. Management: Rheumatology guidelines recommend holding apremilast for 1 to 2 weeks after vaccine administration as permitted by the underlying disease. These guidelines consider apremilast to be an immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medication. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【138】 AzaTHIOprine: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines. Management: Rheumatology guidelines recommend holding azathioprine for 1 to 2 weeks after each vaccine dose as permitted by the underlying disease. This recommendation is specific to patients using azathioprine for rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【139】 Baricitinib: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines. Management: Rheumatology guidelines recommend holding baricitinib, tofactinib, or upadacitinib for 1 to 2 weeks after vaccine administration as permitted by the underlying disease. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【140】 Belimumab: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines. Management: Rheumatology guidelines recommend holding subcutaneous belimumab doses for 1 to 2 weeks after each COVID-19 vaccine dose as disease activity permits. The recommendation specifies subcutaneous belimumab and does not mention intravenous belimumab. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【141】 Calcineurin Inhibitors (Systemic): May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines. Management: Rheumatology guidelines recommend holding calcineurin inhibitors for 1 to 2 weeks after each vaccine dose as permitted by the underlying disease. This is specific to the use of calcineurin inhibitors for rheumatologic or musculoskeletal disease. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【142】 CAR-T Cell Immunotherapy: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA). Management: The CDC recommends that CAR-T-cell recipients who received COVID-19 vaccine prior to or during treatment with CAR-T-cell therapy should be revaccinated with a primary vaccine series at least 3 months (12 weeks) after CAR-T-cell therapy. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【143】 CloZAPine: COVID-19 Vaccines may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of CloZAPine. COVID-19 Vaccines may increase the serum concentration of CloZAPine.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【144】 Corticosteroids (Systemic): May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA). Management: Give a 3-dose primary series for all patients aged 6 months and older taking immunosuppressive medications or therapies. Booster doses are recommended for certain age groups. See CDC guidance for details. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【145】 CycloPHOSphamide: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines.

This is specific to patients using methotrexate for rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【153】 Mycophenolate: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines. Management: Rheumatology guidelines recommend holding mycophenolate for 1 to 2 weeks after each vaccine dose as permitted by the underlying disease. This recommendation is specific to patients using mycophenolate for rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【154】 Propacetamol: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Vaccines. Management: Consider avoiding routine prophylactic use of propacetamol before or during vaccine administration when possible. Propacetamol is still recommended to treat fevers and/or pain that occurs after vaccination. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【155】 Smallpox and Monkeypox Vaccine (Live): May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA). Specifically, the risk of myocarditis may be increased. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【156】 Smallpox Vaccine Live: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA). Specifically, the risk for myocarditis may be increased. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【157】 SulfaSALAzine: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines. Management: Rheumatology guidelines recommend holding sulfasalazine for 1 to 2 weeks after vaccine administration as permitted by the underlying disease. These guidelines consider sulfasalazine to be an immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive medication. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【158】 Teplizumab: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA). Management: mRNA vaccines are not recommended during the 2 weeks before teplizumab, during treatment, or for 6 weeks afterward. The CDC recommends a 3-dose primary series for all patients aged 6 months and older taking immunosuppressive medications or therapies. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【159】 Tixagevimab and Cilgavimab: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines. Management: Wait at least 2 weeks after receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine before administering tixagevimab and cilgavimab for pre-exposure prophylaxis. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【160】 Tofacitinib: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines. Management: Rheumatology guidelines recommend holding baricitinib, tofactinib, or upadacitinib for 1 to 2 weeks after vaccine administration as permitted by the underlying disease. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【161】 Upadacitinib: May diminish the therapeutic effect of COVID-19 Vaccines. Management: Rheumatology guidelines recommend holding baricitinib, tofactinib, or upadacitinib for 1 to 2 weeks after vaccine administration as permitted by the underlying disease. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【162】 Reproductive Considerations\n【163】 Pregnancy testing is not required prior to vaccination. Pregnancy does not need to be delayed following vaccination. mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not a cause of infertility (ACOG 2023).\n【164】 There have been anecdotal reports of temporary menstrual changes following vaccination. Vaccines have not previously been associated with menstrual disturbances; however, environmental stresses can temporarily impact menses. Based on available data, any changes in the length of menstrual cycle following COVID-19 vaccination are <1 day, and changes in duration or quantity of bleeding resolve within 1 to 2 menstrual cycles. COVID-19 vaccines may be given to patients who are menstruating, and vaccination does not need to be scheduled based on menstrual cycle. Potential changes in menstrual bleeding are not a reason to avoid vaccination (ACOG 2023).\n【165】 Due to the risk of severe illness, pregnancy complications, and death from COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, vaccination is strongly recommended for all patients planning a pregnancy, patients trying to become pregnant now, and patients who might become pregnant in the future, including those patients previously diagnosed with COVID-19 infection (ACOG 2023).\n【166】 At least 1 dose of an age-appropriate bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for all patients who do not otherwise have contraindications to the vaccine. The specific number of doses depends on the person's age, COVID-19 vaccination history, immune status, and vaccine product (ACOG 2023; CDC 2023).\n【167】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【168】 Antibodies generated following vaccination of pregnant patients can be detected in cord blood. Placental transfer of IgG antibodies to the neonate increases from time of vaccination to delivery following administration of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine during pregnancy (Fu 2022; Rawal 2022). Antibodies generated in response to the vaccine persist in the infant serum for up to 6 months of age and are higher than those in infants born to infected mothers (Rawal 2022; Shook 2022). Administration of the mRNA vaccine during pregnancy decreases hospitalization due to COVID-19 infection in infants <6 months of age (Halasa 2022a; Halasa 2022b).\n【169】 There was no increased risk of congenital fetal anomalies (identified via ultrasonography) based on data collected from 1,149 pregnant patients vaccinated within 30 days prior to conception until 14 weeks' gestation when compared to nonvaccinated pregnant patients (n=534) or pregnant patients vaccinated outside of this time period (n=1,473) (ACOG 2023; Ruderman 2022). Meta-analyses, one which included data from the V-safe Surveillance System and pregnancy registry and the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), found the rates of small for gestational age, stillbirth, preterm birth, miscarriage, and congenital anomalies to be similar following COVID-19 vaccination when compared to the general population (Ma 2022; Rawal 2022). The rates of gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, or eclampsia following COVID-19 vaccination are also within the known background rate (ACOG 2023; Ma 2022; Rawal 2022). In addition, no safety concerns were detected in a meta-analysis of studies following maternal vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (ACOG 2023; Ciapponi 2023).\n【170】 The immune response generated by the COVID-19 (mRNA) vaccine in pregnant patients is comparable to the immune response in patients who are not pregnant (ACOG 2023). Meta-analyses of available studies have found the antibody response in pregnant patients provided by vaccination to be higher than that following natural infection (Fu 2022; Rawal 2022). The rates of injection-site pain, injection-site soreness, and fatigue occurred at rates similar to nonpregnant patients (Fu 2022; Rawal 2022). Using data from the VAERS, reports of acute adverse events requiring medical attention following vaccination during pregnancy are uncommon (DeSilva 2022). A large observational cohort study evaluating the COVID-19 (mRNA) vaccine found the incidence of significant adverse health events to be lower in vaccinated pregnant patients compared to age-matched unvaccinated pregnant persons (Sadarangani 2022). COVID-19 vaccination effectively prevents COVID-19 infection and hospitalization in pregnant patients (Ma 2022; Rawal 2022). If severe infection and hospitalization occur, pregnant patients who are vaccinated are significantly less likely to require ICU admission, intubation, or die (de Freitas Paganoti 2022). Based on available data, mRNA vaccines are likely to have the same safety and efficacy in pregnant and nonpregnant patients (ACOG 2023).\n【171】 The risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection is increased in symptomatic pregnant patients compared to nonpregnant patients. Pregnant and recently pregnant patients with moderate or severe infection are at increased risk of complications such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage, or other infections compared to pregnant patients without COVID-19. Pregnant patients with symptoms may require ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or ventilatory support (ECMO) compared to symptomatic nonpregnant patients. Other adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm birth and stillbirth. The risk of coagulopathy, cesarean delivery, and maternal death may be increased; neonates have an increased risk for NICU admission. Maternal age and comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, lung disease, and obesity may also increase the risk of severe illness in pregnant and recently pregnant patients (ACOG FAQ 2023; NIH 2023).\n【172】 Due to the risk of severe illness, pregnancy complications, and death from COVID-19 infection during pregnancy, vaccination is strongly recommended. At least 1 dose of an age-appropriate bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for all pregnant patients who do not otherwise have contraindications to the vaccine. The specific number of doses depends on the person's age, COVID-19 vaccination history, immune status, and vaccine product (ACOG 2023; CDC 2023).\n【173】 Vaccination of pregnant patients may be done in any setting authorized to administer the vaccine. The COVID-19 vaccine may be administered in any trimester and should be given as soon as possible to maximize maternal and fetal health. COVID-19 vaccines may be administered simultaneously with other vaccines routinely administered during pregnancy. Vaccination status should be documented for all pregnant patients; for patients who do not receive the COVID-19 vaccine, the discussion should be documented in the medical record and vaccination offered again at subsequent visits (ACOG 2023).\n【174】 Rho(D) immune globulin is not expected to interfere with an immune response to the COVID-19 vaccine. Treatment should not be withheld in patients planning to be vaccinated or who recently received the COVID-19 vaccine (ACOG 2023).\n【175】 Information related to COVID-19 vaccines continues to emerge; refer to current guidelines for vaccinating pregnant patients.\n【176】 Data collection to monitor maternal and infant outcomes following exposure to COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy is ongoing:\n【177】 - Health care providers are encouraged to enroll patients exposed to the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine during pregnancy in the Moderna Pregnancy Registry (1-866-663-3762).\n【178】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【179】 mRNA from the COVID-19 (mRNA) vaccines may be present in breast milk.\n【180】 - Breast milk was sampled in 14 lactating patients (~9 months postpartum) following administration of 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine. Sampling occurred prior to and at intervals up to 4 to 6 weeks after the second dose. Among 40 samples, 36 (90%) showed no traces of vaccine mRNA. Negligible vaccine mRNA at levels of 2 ng/mL were measurable only within the first week of either dose. Authors of this study calculated the estimated exposure to a breastfed infant would be 0.667% of the vaccine dose in 100 mL of breast milk. Any vaccine mRNA would be readily destroyed by enzymes in the infant GI tract. There were no adverse events observed in the breastfed infants (Low 2021).\n【181】 - Trace amounts of vaccine mRNA were found in the breast milk of lactating patients who were administered the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (n=6) or the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (n=5) within 6 months of delivery. Breast milk was collected for 5 days after vaccination. Five participants had COVID-19 vaccine mRNA present in a breast milk sample, all within 45 hours of receiving the vaccine. There was no vaccine mRNA present in breast milk collected 48 hours after vaccination (Hanna 2022).\n【182】 - COVID-19 (mRNA) vaccines contain PEGylated proteins. In a study of 13 lactating patients who received a COVID-19 (mRNA) vaccine, breast milk was sampled prior to the first vaccination and up to 2 weeks after the second dose. The level of PEGylated proteins in breast milk was not significantly different following vaccination (Golan 2021).\n【183】 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies are present in breast milk following vaccination as well as natural infection. Meta-analyses of data obtained following administration of the COVID-19 (mRNA) vaccine to lactating women show breast milk contains IgG and IgA, with the greatest concentrations achieved after the second dose (Fu 2022; Muyldermans 2022; Whited 2022). The degree of clinical benefit of maternal vaccination to the breastfed infant is not yet known (ACOG 2023).\n【184】 Meta-analyses of data obtained following administration of the COVID-19 (mRNA) vaccine show adverse reactions following vaccination are not significantly different in lactating patients compared to pregnant or nonpregnant patients. The most common side effects are fatigue, fever, headache, chills, muscle pain, and pain at the injection site. Reactions were more common following the second dose (Fu 2022; Muyldermans 2022). Transient changes in milk supply (both increases and decreases) have been reported following COVID-19 (mRNA) vaccine administration (Lamers 2022; Muyldermans 2022). A few mothers have also noted a transient change of breast milk to a blue-green color following the first or second dose (Muyldermans 2022).\n【185】 Lactating patients produce immune responses to vaccination comparable to nonlactating persons (ACOG 2023).\n【186】 The risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection is increased in recently pregnant patients compared to nonpregnant patients (ACOG FAQ 2023). At least 1 dose of an age-appropriate bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine is recommended for all lactating patients who do not otherwise have contraindications to the vaccine. The specific number of doses depends on the person's age, COVID-19 vaccination history, immune status, and vaccine product. The initiation of breastfeeding does not need to be avoided, and breastfeeding does not need to be discontinued in patients who are vaccinated (ACOG 2023).\n【187】 Monitoring Parameters\n【188】 Monitor for hypersensitivity and syncope for 15 minutes following administration (ACIP [Kroger 2023]; CDC 2023). Observe patients for 30 minutes after vaccination in those patients with the following: a history of nonsevere, immediate (within 4 hours) allergic reaction after receipt of a COVID-19 vaccine; a history of anaphylaxis following receipt of a non–COVID-19 vaccine or injectable therapy; or a person with an allergy-related contraindication to a different type of COVID-19 vaccine (CDC 2023). If seizure-like activity associated with syncope occurs, maintain patient in supine or Trendelenburg position to reestablish adequate cerebral perfusion.\n【189】 Antibody testing to assess for SARS-CoV-2 immunity before or following vaccination is not currently recommended (CDC 2023).\n【190】 Mechanism of Action\n【191】 Promotes active immunization against COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. The modified messenger RNA (mRNA) in the vaccine is formulated in lipid particles that enable delivery of the RNA into host cells to allow expression of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) antigen. The vaccine elicits both neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses to the S antigen, which protects against COVID-19 disease.\n【192】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【193】 Onset of action:\n【194】 Brand Names: International\n【195】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "COVID-19 mRNA vaccines  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/covid-19-mrna-vaccines-drug-information?search=%E5%9B%A0%E7%97%85%E4%BA%BA%E5%AF%B9%E7%96%AB%E8%8B%97%E6%88%96%E5%85%B6%E6%88%90%E5%88%86%E8%BF%87%E6%95%8F%E8%80%8C%E6%9C%AA%E8%BF%9B%E8%A1%8C%E5%85%8D%E7%96%AB&source=search_result&selectedTitle=116%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:51", "update_time": "2024-03-04 19:50:47"}

Excessive accumulation of iron is a serious problem that may not be detected because transfusion therapy may be irregular and episodic. The approach to transfusion must balance these benefits and risks, both in decisions regarding when to transfuse and in the practical aspects of how transfusions are administered.\n【2】 Here we discuss complications of transfusion unique to this population, including high rates of alloimmunization and iron overload.\n【3】 Separate topic reviews present an overview of the indications for transfusion and transfusion techniques in SCD, RBC antigens, and the general evaluation and management of transfusion reactions:\n【4】 Transfusions are used acutely for the treatment of:\n【5】 Transfusions are used prophylactically during pregnancy, perioperatively, and to reduce incidence of a range of vaso-occlusive complications of SCD including:\n【6】 The most prominent misuse of blood transfusion therapy is simple transfusion in an adult or child with SCD admitted to the hospital for an uncomplicated vaso-occlusive pain episode without symptomatic anemia or vaso-occlusive pain without a significant change from the individual's baseline hemoglobin (typically <2 g/dL). In such a situation, there is no evidence that simple transfusion therapy will abate the pain episode, and there is a finite risk of transfusion-related complications, including the increased risk for alloimmunization .\n【7】 For complicated vaso-occlusive pain episodes treated in the hospital, transfusion may be appropriate in the following instances:\n【8】 In these situations, transfusion is used as an adjunct to (not a substitute for) pain management.   \"Evaluation of acute pain in sickle cell disease\" and  \"Acute vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease\" and  \"Disease-modifying therapies to prevent pain and other complications of sickle cell disease\".)\n【9】 Details are presented separately.   \"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques\", section on 'RBC antigen matching' and  \"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques\", section on 'Simple versus exchange transfusion'.)\n【10】 As an example, in the Silent Cerebral Infarct Transfusion (SIT) trial, there were 3236 transfusions administered; of these, nine participants had one reaction, six had two reactions, and one had four reactions . Eight of 3236 transfusions (0.2 percent) were associated with a FNHTR and 13 of 3236 (0.4 percent) with an allergic reaction.\n【11】 Patients with an acute transfusion reaction are generally treated similarly to individuals without SCD.   \"Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction\".)\n【12】 The evaluation and additional management of these reactions is discussed separately.   \"Immunologic transfusion reactions\", section on 'Anaphylactic transfusion reactions' and  \"Immunologic transfusion reactions\", section on 'Allergic reactions'.)\n【13】 Rather than using diphenhydramine, which is sedating, we use a nonsedating histamine 1 (H1)-receptor antagonist to treat an acute reaction with rigors.   \"Immunologic transfusion reactions\", section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions'.)\n【14】 Rigors associated with FNHTR are acute and self-limited; if there are any signs that suggest possible bacterial infection, the patient should be evaluated and treated accordingly, as patients with SCD are functionally asplenic and at risk of serious morbidities and mortality from sepsis.   \"Evaluation and management of fever in children and adults with sickle cell disease\", section on 'Risk of life-threatening infection' and  \"Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection\", section on 'Immediate interventions'.)\n【15】 In contrast to using a single dose of meperidine for rigors, we avoid meperidine for treating acute vaso-occlusive pain events in SCD because of potential toxicities of use for >24 to 48 hours (due to production of a toxic metabolite, normeperidine).\n【16】 As discussed separately, matching for additional Rh antigens (C, E, or C/c, E/e) and the Kell blood group antigen K is also recommended for individuals with SCD and has been demonstrated to reduce alloimmunization rates significantly .   \"Red blood cell antigens and antibodies\" and  \"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques\", section on 'RBC antigen matching'.)\n【17】 Direct comparison of the prevalence of alloimmunization in individuals with and without SCD is challenging because individuals with SCD receive more blood transfusions compared to individuals without SCD. Individuals with SCD are one of the most frequently transfused and heavily alloimmunized groups of patients, with the prevalence ranging from 7 to 59 percent Patients with SCD are one of the most frequently transfused and heavily alloimmunized groups of patients, with the prevalence ranging from 7 to 59 percent . This compares with a prevalence of 2 to 3 percent of transfused patients in general hospital populations . In the absence of Rh (C, E or C/c, E/e) and K antigen matching, alloimmunization occurs in approximately 30 percent of individuals with SCD who are transfused at least intermittently .\n【18】 Instead of the prevalence of alloimmunization, the incidence rate of new alloantibodies per 100 units of RBCs transfused should be used, so that reasonable comparisons can be made from one study to another. Even when using the alloimmunization incidence per 100 units of RBCs, the true incidence may be biased unless the entire transfusion history is taken into account. Two randomized controlled trials conducted in children with SCD provided an estimate of the alloimmunization incidence rates, because relatively few children received transfusions prior to the entry into the trial, and the trial protocols intended for all units to be matched for Rh antigens C and E, and Kell antigen K:\n【19】 These trials indicate that when RBCs are prophylactically matched at a minimum for C, E, and K, the expected alloimmunization rate is low, between 0.28 and 0.5 per 100 units transfused.\n【20】 DHTRs are not always recognized, since their presentations are sometimes subtle. When specifically evaluated, the prevalence of DHTRs in individuals with SCD appears to be between 5 and 10 percent or higher.\n【21】 Under-recognition of DHTRs was notable in a 2019 retrospective study in a cohort of 624 transfused individuals with SCD . The study found laboratory evidence of DHTR based on total hemoglobin (Hb) and sickle hemoglobin (Hb S) levels, with 54 of 178 antibodies (30.3 percent); of these, fewer than half were recognized by the patient or provider at the time of the event.\n【22】 The higher frequency of DHTRs in individuals with SCD is thought to primarily be due to the higher frequency of transfusions in which blood group incompatibilities exist between the donor population, which is predominantly White individuals, and the recipient SCD population, which is predominantly of African descent .\n【23】 Antibodies against the Rh (D, C/c, E/e), Kell (K), Duffy (Fya, Fyb), and Kidd (Jka, Jkb) antigens present the greatest problem in transfusing these individuals .   \"Red blood cell antigens and antibodies\", section on 'Rh antigens' and  \"Red blood cell antigens and antibodies\", section on 'Kidd antigens' and  \"Red blood cell antigens and antibodies\", section on 'Duffy antigens' and  \"Red blood cell antigens and antibodies\", section on 'Kell antigens'.)\n【24】 This underscores the importance of prophylactic Rh (C, E, or C/c, E/e) and K antigen matching. Finding sufficient compatible donors requires recruitment of donors from the same ethnic backgrounds.   \"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques\", section on 'RBC antigen matching' and  \"Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion in individuals with serologic complexity\".)\n【25】 The patient often has pain with evidence of hemolysis but a low reticulocyte count. Hemoglobin analysis typically demonstrates the disappearance of the transfused, Hb A-containing RBCs. Individuals with SCD have hemolysis at baseline, so hemolytic markers may be less helpful, and the evaluation should focus on the identification of new alloantibodies.   \"Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion\", section on 'Antibody screen'.)\n【26】 In some cases, Hb analysis may suggest \"bystander\" hemolysis of the patient's Hb S-containing RBCs, also referred to as hyperhemolysis or hyperhemolytic crisis. Hyperhemolysis events are serious and can be life-threatening .   \"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease\", section on 'Hyperhemolytic crisis'.)\n【27】 In some cases, there will be multiple alloantibodies, making it difficult to obtain compatible RBCs for transfusion. In a 2016 analysis of 99 DHTRs in SCD, the overall mortality was 6 percent, and these DHTRs were often associated with pain events and secondary acute chest syndrome .   \"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques\", section on 'Symptomatic or severe anemia' and  \"Pretransfusion testing for red blood cell transfusion\", section on 'Sickle cell disease'.)\n【28】 Any patient with a positive DAT should undergo evaluation to identify the antibody specificity (antibody identification) to avoid this antigen in future transfusions. Since these events are more likely following transfusion for an acute complication of SCD, any patient who has been recently transfused and presents with symptoms of worsening anemia should be evaluated for a DHTR.   \"Hemolytic transfusion reactions\", section on 'Evaluation of DHTR and DSTR'.)\n【29】 Hyperhemolysis is a serious but rare complication that may accompany a DHTR  'Hyperhemolysis' below and  \"Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease\", section on 'Hyperhemolytic crisis'). Since DHTRs with hyperhemolysis are uncommon, the role of immunosuppressive therapy is based on case reports, case series, and expertise. In the event that a patient with SCD and hyperhemolysis requires preparation for hematopoietic stem cell transplant, gene therapy, or gene editing, referral to a transplant center with local expertise in immunosuppressive therapy is appropriate.\n【30】 If additional transfusions are required, at a minimum, the red cells should be matched for ABO, Rh (C, E or C/c, E/e) and K, and RBC units should lack any antigens identified in the DHTR evaluation . We also attempt to provide extended matching for Jka/Jkb, Fya/Fyb, and S/s. However, there should be close communication with the blood bank about the availability of extended antigen-matched units, and any delays in transfusion must be weighed against the patient's clinical status and urgency with which further transfusion is needed.   \"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques\", section on 'Indications for transfusion'.)\n【31】 Hyperhemolysis and other severe hemolytic reactions, defined as transfusion-associated hemolysis with a rapid hemoglobin decline to below the pretransfusion level and rapid decline of the post-transfusion Hb A level, require prompt intervention, but evidence to guide optimal therapy is limited .\n【32】 We suggest prompt initiation of immunosuppressive therapy for patients with hyperhemolysis with a glucocorticoid, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), or both, especially for those who require further transfusions. The choice between glucocorticoids, IVIG, or both is individualized .\n【33】 We also administer erythropoietin as a means of reducing the need for further transfusions, although transfusions may be required if the patient is experiencing life-threatening anemia . Case reports and small series have demonstrated erythropoietin to be associated with good outcomes without major serious adverse events . Doses in the range of 4000 international units subcutaneously once per day for 7 to 14 days have been used .\n【34】 Management of parvovirus-induced anemia is supportive with transfusions as needed.   \"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques\", section on 'Symptomatic or severe anemia'.)\n【35】 The infection typically resolves after several days or in some cases weeks. For the rare patient with chronic infection and chronic hemolysis, intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) can be administered.   \"Treatment and prevention of parvovirus B19 infection\", section on 'Transient aplastic crisis' and  \"Treatment and prevention of parvovirus B19 infection\", section on 'Chronic infection with anemia'.)\n【36】 Prestorage leukoreduction of RBCs is also a means of preventing febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions (FNHTRs).   \"Immunologic transfusion reactions\", section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reactions'.)\n【37】 Evaluation and management of TTBI is discussed separately.   \"Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection\".)\n【38】 The combination of iron overload, chelation therapy (which mobilizes iron), and immunosuppression (from functional asplenia and treatment with glucocorticoids) increases risk for iron-avid organisms such as Yersinia enterocolitica .  'Excessive iron stores' below and  \"Evaluation and management of fever in children and adults with sickle cell disease\", section on 'Risk of life-threatening infection'.)\n【39】 Hyperviscosity is a risk in some individuals receiving simple transfusions; this is because simple transfusion can raise the total Hb but only marginally lower the percentage of Hb S. In SCD, there is an optimal balance of increasing Hb levels and viscosity while also increasing oxygen delivery.\n【40】 With a simple transfusion in individuals with SCD, increasing the Hb level will result in an increase in oxygen delivery up to a certain threshold, after which there is a decrease in the oxygen delivery with further increases in Hb. Based on in vitro studies and experts' clinical experience, the risk of decreased oxygen delivery is considered to be highest when the total Hb is >10 g/dL and the Hb S is >50 percent of total Hb .\n【41】 Symptoms of hyperviscosity are nonspecific and related to the affected vascular bed. The literature does not describe many cases of hyperviscosity syndrome, in part because hyperviscosity syndrome complications in SCD are often unintended and potentially avoidable consequences of a transfusion therapy. Central nervous system-related injury is the most severe hyperviscosity sequela in children and adults with SCD. Hyperviscosity in SCD can be associated with the following complications:\n【42】 The major strategies for preventing hyperviscosity include using exchange transfusion rather than simple transfusion for individuals with Hb >10 g/dL and Hb S >50 percent of total Hb, and using phlebotomy for those with a post-transfusion Hb above 12 to 13 g/dL and Hb S >50 percent.   \"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques\", section on 'Simple versus exchange transfusion'.)\n【43】 The preferred method to attenuate excessive iron stores is automated RBC exchange, or to a lesser degree, manual exchange.   \"Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease: Indications and transfusion techniques\", section on 'Simple versus exchange transfusion'.)\n【44】 The American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for SCD and transfusion support suggests using automated RBC exchange over simple transfusion or manual RBC exchange in patients receiving chronic transfusions . A shared decision-making model with the patient and family is recommended; this should consider patient age, patient preferences, need for a central venous access device, iron overload status, adherence with iron chelation, and the availability of compatible RBCs, especially in heavily alloimmunized individuals.\n【45】 Compared with simple transfusion, automated RBC exchange results in a smaller increase in ferritin. This was illustrated in a secondary analysis of the Silent Cerebral Infarct Trial (SIT), a stroke prevention trial that compared regular transfusions versus standard of care . The method of regular transfusion (simple transfusion, manual exchange transfusion, or automated exchange transfusion) was determined by the site investigators based on local resources and patient characteristics. A secondary analysis involving 83 participants who received monthly blood transfusion therapy for one year analyzed the effect of the transfusion method on ferritin levels  were as follows :\n【46】 Only 9 participants received automated exchange transfusion, and the analysis only covered one year of transfusion therapy . Nevertheless, these data clearly show the benefit of automated exchange transfusion in attenuating iron overload compared with the other transfusion methods.\n【47】 The center of one of the authors no longer offers simple transfusions to patients who require monthly blood transfusions to maintain Hb S levels <30 percent of total Hb. The patients receive either manual or automated exchange transfusions. Occasional patients will receive simple transfusions as a short-term measure or because a central line cannot be placed, but generally, they do not perform simple transfusions for >12 months. This practice is informed by several cases of premature death in adolescents with SCD who received simple transfusions for many years coupled with non-adherence to chelation therapy.\n【48】 For those who receive regular, chronic simple transfusions, iron chelation therapy is an important component of the transfusion program because it prevents complications of iron deposition in organs, particularly in the liver. Long-term efficacy and safety studies on the effects of chelation on morbidity and mortality in individuals with SCD have not been completed, but existing data and multiple consensus reports recommend iron chelation therapy for transfusion iron overload .  'Chelation therapy' below.)\n【49】 In contrast to chelation, phlebotomy cannot be used to remove iron in transfusion-dependent individuals due to their baseline anemia; phlebotomy is useful only in the rare individual with SCD and a high baseline hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. In such cases, automated apheresis is effective in minimizing the iron burden and may prevent the need for chelation . Excess iron can be removed by phlebotomy following hematopoietic stem cell transplant, provided the post-transplant Hb concentration is sufficiently high to allow for a transient further decrease in Hb.   \"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in sickle cell disease\", section on 'Supportive care'.)\n【50】 Other means of minimizing iron burden include :\n【51】 We prefer to draw the ferritin levels with each blood draw at routine outpatient visits to monitor the trend for the individual, which is more representative of iron stores than a single ferritin measurement. Patients receiving chelation therapy have monitoring of serum ferritin level at every transfusion. Since the ferritin fluctuates, it is important to average three to five serial ferritin measurements before determining the direction in change of iron stores.\n【52】 We aim to maintain a serum ferritin value no greater than 1000 to 1500 ng/mL (no greater than 1000 to 1500 mcg/L). However, periodic monitoring of quantitative liver iron is important, as discussed below.  'Liver' below.)\n【53】 Additional evaluations for endocrine dysfunction may be appropriate (thyroid function, FSH and LH in females, testosterone in males).\n【54】 We prefer to use MRI to monitor iron status and adjust chelation for a number of reasons, including the lack of a clear correlation of steady-state ferritin levels with hepatic iron stores and the desire to avoid an invasive procedure . At least two studies found a poor correlation of serum ferritin with hepatic iron stores as determined by liver biopsy in patients who were receiving chronic transfusions . Furthermore, significant variability of the liver iron content may occur within the liver, such that a single needle biopsy may not be representative of the total liver iron content .\n【55】 We reserve liver biopsy for rare individuals with SCD in whom the MRI-based estimate of the liver iron content is inconsistent with the transfusion history or where there is concern regarding liver function (and assessment of liver histology is needed). Some curative therapy protocols may require a liver biopsy to assess for bridging fibrosis. However, the clinical utility of this indication for a liver biopsy is unclear, particularly in individuals with low liver iron content.   \"Methods to determine hepatic iron content\".)\n【56】 While improved chelation programs may stabilize patients with cardiac dysfunction, the root cause of excessive iron strokes must be addressed by a multidisciplinary team. Serious iron overload can result from nonadherence to therapy. Factors causing nonadherence, including lack of family/caregiver support and home infrastructure, must be addressed to have long-term improvement.\n【57】 Generally, chelation therapy is started after one to two years of transfusion in chronically transfused individuals, when the serum ferritin exceeds at least 1000 to 1500 mcg/L (ng/mL) or the liver iron is >3 to 5 mg/g dry weight. Often this correlates with a total transfusion burden of approximately 120 to 200 mL of transfused RBCs per kilogram, although in practice, calculating this volume may not be very helpful. A quality-of-care indicator from the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that children receive chelation therapy to maintain a ferritin <1500 ng/mL or liver iron <7 mg/g dry weight .\n【58】 The major challenge in using these criteria is that when patients transition to exchange transfusion from simple transfusion, the ferritin level typically falls below 1000 ng/mL after 12 months, but the tissue iron stores may still be high. We prefer to use annual liver MRI and initiate chelation if the liver iron is >3 mg/g dry weight or if the serum ferritin is >1000 ng/mL on two consecutive measurements.\n【59】 The targets used for iron chelation therapy are changing as better iron chelators become available. Studies addressing the long-term safety and efficacy of maintaining near normal iron stores have not been completed .\n【60】 Baseline testing prior to starting chelation includes audiology, ophthalmology, and pregnancy test in females.\n【61】 Most patients require modification of dosing based on response and organ function over time. As examples:\n【62】 Invariably, clinicians will identify a subgroup of children or adults with SCD with excessive liver iron stores (eg, >15 mg/g dry weight, either by MRI or liver biopsy), without evidence of immediate cardiac arrhythmias or left ventricular dysfunction. In such situations, considerations should be made for alternative strategies for aggressive chelation, including hospitalization for intravenous chelation therapy and combination chelation. Inpatient chelation should be managed by (or in consultation with) a clinician with experience in this approach. Example dosing includes deferoxamine 50 mg/kg over 24 hours for two days plus deferasirox 20 to 40 mg/kg daily for two days. Deferiprone may be added if heart failure or significant cardiac iron overload is present. Deferasirox may be added if liver iron content is very high.\n【63】 In the event that the patient has evidence of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias or left ventricular dysfunction, we recommend extended inpatient hospitalization for chelation therapy with long-term combination chelation therapy. Chelation regimens for the management of cardiac dysfunction have been established for patients with thalassemia .   \"Acute iron poisoning\", section on 'Deferoxamine'.)\n【64】 Other acute events that require immediate temporary withdrawal of chelation therapy include acute respiratory distress, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and acute gastrointestinal bleeding. Deferoxamine has been associated with acute respiratory distress that can mimic acute chest syndrome. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has been seen with deferasirox, especially in older adults with malignancies or thrombocytopenia .\n【65】 Chelating agents may affect the growth of some microorganisms (eg, Yersinia enterocolitica) and should be held temporarily in patients with fever or active infection until the patient becomes afebrile.  'Bacterial infection' above.)\n【66】 Decisions regarding discontinuation of the chelating agent or switching to a different chelator are made on a case-by-case basis depending on a variety of factors including the severity of the SCD complication, severity of the chelator toxicity, and availability and tolerability of alternative agents.\n【67】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Acute high-dose exposure to arsenic can cause severe systemic toxicity and death. Lower-dose chronic arsenic exposure can result in subacute toxicity that can include skin changes and skin cancer, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular effects, peripheral vascular disease, hepatotoxicity, and other conditions . Latent or long-term effects of arsenic exposure include an increased risk of cancers, even after exposure has ceased.\n【2】 Clinicians may need to consider arsenic exposure in the emergency care setting when treating those suspected of acute poisoning or those who present with prolonged or intermittent gastrointestinal symptoms that are atypical for most viral and bacterial enteric illnesses . In the office setting, clinicians may need to consider questions concerning chronic arsenic exposure in patients whose source of water is well water, exposure from food (particularly rice products), and exposure in other environmental or occupational settings.\n【3】 SOURCES OF EXPOSURE\n【4】 Overview — Arsenic is a naturally occurring element found in the earth's crust and within numerous ores. It is classed as a metalloid because it complexes with metals; it also reacts with other elements such as oxygen, hydrogen, chlorine, carbon, and sulfur. Elemental arsenic is rare, and the element exists more commonly as organic or inorganic compounds .\n【5】 Arsenical compounds can be grouped as inorganic, organic, and arsine gas (AsH3). They are further classified according to their valence states: elemental (0), arsenite (trivalent, +3), and arsenate (pentavalent, +5). Trivalent arsenic or arsenite compounds, both inorganic and organic, are considered the most toxic. However, other organic forms of arsenic, found in some fish and crustaceans, as well as other foods, consisting mostly of arsenobetaine (a trimethylated arsenic compound sometime called \"fish arsenic\"), arsenocholine, and arsenosugars, are excreted rapidly and are thought to be of negligible toxicity .\n【6】 Human exposures can occur from natural sources, such as volcanic eruptions, and arsenic leaching from soil and rocks into drinking water. Exposure can also through inhalation, usually when workers are exposed to arsenic dusts as in smelting and refining .\n【7】 Inorganic arsenic levels in food are generally low and, when present, usually occur from contaminated soil-derived foods such as rice . Certain foods may contain potentially toxic levels of arsenic. As an example, some analyses have found high levels of inorganic arsenic in hijiki (hiziki) seaweed .\n【8】 Of note, arsenic is no longer produced in the United States; all of the arsenic used in the United States is imported . Human-made exposures derive from various sources including :\n【9】 Drinking water — Chronic exposures to arsenic can occur from drinking water . In some locations, this contamination presents an enormous health hazard, as in the case of the ongoing epidemic of arsenic poisoning in West Bengal, India, and Bangladesh. High levels of arsenic leaching from natural underground sources have contaminated newly drilled wells, leading to more than one million people drinking arsenic-contaminated water (above 50 mcg/L) . Thousands of people living there have been found to have arsenic-related skin lesions, liver problems, decreased motor function, and neuropathy .\n【10】 Although less common, there have also been case reports of arsenic poisoning in the United States due to contaminated well water, and in rural Australia, from stream water thought to be contaminated from a nearby mine .\n【11】 The greater focus of the United States and other countries has been on the potential long-term adverse health outcomes from chronic exposures to much lower doses of arsenic in drinking water (below a level that causes acute clinical manifestations) that could lead to future increased risk of cancer  'Cancer' below) and other health problems. Age at first exposure to high levels of arsenic in drinking water has also been related to increase risks of various cancers decades later . To reduce the risk of cancer and other chronic effects, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lowered the arsenic standard for drinking water from 50 parts per billion (ppb) to 10 ppb, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set 10 ppb for bottled water . In the United States, drinking water generally contains an average of 2 mcg/L (2 ppb) of arsenic, although 12 percent of water supplies from surface water sources in the North Central region of the country and 12 percent of supplies from ground water sources in the Western region have levels exceeding 20 mcg/L (20 ppb) .\n【12】 In addition, arsenic contamination has been found in rice products . This has raised particular concerns since rice cereal has been one of the first foods given to children. This has lead to updated recommendations for how to reduce arsenic exposure in a baby’s diet . In one study, a toddler milk formula containing organic brown rice syrup as a sweetener had total arsenic concentrations of up to six times the EPA safe drinking water limit. In 2016,the FDA proposed a limit or \"action level\" of 100 ppb of inorganic arsenic found in infant rice cereal, which parallels guidance from the European Commission for rice foods for infants and young children . These interventions to reduce early exposure to arsenic are particularly important as more information is emerging about the potential for latent effects from early-life arsenic exposure .\n【13】 There is also evidence that inorganic arsenic may accumulate in the meat of chickens treated with a growth-promoting arsenical drug, \"roxarsone\" .\n【14】 Pressure-treated wood — Pressure-treated wood has been preserved by pressure treatment with pesticides including chromate copper arsenate (CCA), ammoniacal copper arsenate (ACA), and ammoniacal copper zinc arsenate (ACZA) in order to protect it from insect infestation, decay, and marine environments. In 2003, United States manufacturers began a voluntary phase-out of arsenic-containing wood preservatives for wood used in some residential uses such as play structures, picnic tables, decks, and fencing . However, there are still existing wood structures that have CCA-treated elements.\n【15】 Episodes of arsenic poisoning have been described in workers sawing the wood who were exposed to arsenic through inhalation or skin contact and in people burning arsenical-treated wood who were exposed to the arsenic-contaminated smoke .\n【16】 BIOLOGICAL BASIS OF DISEASE — Tasteless and odorless in soluble form, arsenic compounds are well absorbed after ingestion or inhalation. For most trivalent and pentavalent arsenical compounds dissolved in water, gastrointestinal absorption exceeds 90 percent, whereas poorly soluble compounds such as arsenic trioxide are less well absorbed . Skin absorption is minimal acutely but could result in low-level absorption from chronic application of arsenic-containing products. Arsenic can cross the placenta and accumulate in the fetus .\n【17】 Arsenic is readily taken up by red blood cells and then quickly distributed to other tissues. Peak serum levels are reached approximately 30 to 60 minutes after a single oral dose. A study of humans receiving one intravenous radioisotope of arsenic found that arsenic was cleared in three phases :\n【18】 The majority of trivalent arsenic is metabolized via methylation to form monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) followed by dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and excreted through the urine .\n【19】 The rapid elimination from the blood explains why blood testing is less reliable, and there is more reliance on urine testing to measure arsenic, except in cases of the earliest acute poisoning. Arsenic is initially distributed to the liver, kidney, muscle and skin, and ultimately to all tissues including the brain . Arsenic also crosses the placenta and can accumulate in the fetus.\n【20】 Primary target organs for toxicity are the gastrointestinal tract, skin, bone marrow, kidneys, and peripheral nervous system. Chronic ingestion of small amounts of inorganic arsenic results in the highest concentration in hair, nails, skin, and tissues rich in cysteine-containing proteins .\n【21】 Trivalent arsenic (+3), the most toxic form, avidly binds to sulfhydryl groups (proteins, glutathione, cysteine) and interferes with numerous enzyme systems, such as those involving cellular respiration (inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase [PDH]), gluconeogenesis and glucose uptake, and glutathione metabolism . Pentavalent arsenic (+5) and arsine gas are converted to trivalent arsenic in vivo, but they may also have some direct effect on uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation .\n【22】 Other mechanisms of actions are being studied to explain underlying latent disease risks (such as increased risk of cancer, disturbances of immune function) associated with early-life arsenic exposure, even at lower levels of arsenic exposure . A major focus of this research is on \"epigenetic reprogramming,\" or changes to gene expression (as from DNA methylation) that ultimately lead to future increased susceptibility to develop cancer .\n【23】 CLINICAL TOXICITY AND PRESENTATION\n【24】 Acute poisoning — Acute arsenic poisoning can occur after ingestions or, in workers, from acute inhalation exposure to high levels of arsenic dusts or fumes. Symptoms following acute, large exposures to inorganic arsenic may develop within minutes or hours.\n【25】 Acute toxicity typically starts in the gastrointestinal system and includes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and severe watery diarrhea . There may be a garlic odor of the breath and stool in severely poisoned patients . These symptoms are soon followed by dehydration, hypotension.\n【26】 Acute arsenic poisoning can also result in QTc prolongation with subsequent torsades de pointes . In severe cases, patients may experience cardiac arrhythmias, shock, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sometimes death . In some cases, acute encephalopathy can develop and progress over several days, with delirium, coma, and seizures . There have also been reports of more persistent central nervous system symptoms such as headache, confusion, and memory problems . Renal injury can lead to proteinuria, hematuria, acute tubular necrosis, and anuria .\n【27】 The severity of the toxicity and symptom presentation depends upon the form and dose of the arsenic compounds. Acute oral exposure to inorganic arsenic at doses of 600 mcg per kg body weight per day or higher has resulted in death .\n【28】 If severely poisoned individuals survive the initial illness, they usually develop hepatitis and pancytopenia within a week and then may experience a painful sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy one to three weeks after the exposure. This has been described as beginning with distal paresthesias, followed rapidly by an ascending sensory loss and weakness, which can sometimes mimic Guillain-Barré syndrome .\n【29】 The blood changes are usually reversible once exposure ceases. Partial recovery from peripheral neuropathy can occur in some cases, especially in the more mild cases of poisoning .\n【30】 Other symptoms that can develop after severe acute poisoning include dermatologic lesions (patchy alopecia, diffuse pruritic macular rash, herpetic-like ulcers in the mouth), respiratory symptoms (dry, hacking cough), and/or Mees lines (horizontal 1 to 2 mm white lines on the nails, also called transverse leukonychia), which occur from a disturbance in the nail matrix keratinization . It usually takes at least 30 days for the Mees lines to become visible.\n【31】 Less severely acutely poisoned patients may experience persistent gastroenteritis and mild hypotension necessitating intravenous fluids, along with a metallic taste and irritated mucous membranes that can mimic pharyngitis .\n【32】 Chronic and latent toxicity — Chronic effects can occur as the sequelae of acute poisoning (as discussed above) or as the result of chronic longer-term exposure to lower levels of arsenic. Latent toxicity (such as cancer) can occur after exposure has ceased.\n【33】 Chronic exposure to arsenical compounds have occurred at work , usually through inhalation of arsenic-containing vapors or dusts, or through non-work environmental exposures, such as drinking arsenic-contaminated water. The clinical effects of chronic toxicity can have an insidious onset and thus be more difficult to diagnose. In chronic exposure, the skin manifestations and peripheral neurologic complaints are usually more prominent than the gastrointestinal symptoms; there is also an increased future risk of cancer .\n【34】 Skin lesions — Different types of arsenic-related skin lesions have been described in the West Bengal and Bangladesh chronic poisonings . Hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation can be an early manifestation , and periungual pigmentation .\n【35】 Skin carcinomas and Bowen's disease (squamous cell carcinoma in situ) . A cohort study from Bangladesh found a dose-response relationship between exposure to arsenic in drinking water and the risk of premalignant lesions; compared with exposure to well water with a concentration of arsenic below 8.1 mcg/L, the adjusted odds ratio for premalignant skin lesions was 5.4 in people exposed to water with a concentration between 175.1 and 864 mcg/L . In the United States, private well water is not regulated and so may have elevated levels of arsenic, placing exposed individuals at an increased risk for developing skin cancers .\n【36】 Peripheral vascular disease with associated gangrene, called \"Blackfoot\" disease, has been described in relationship to chronic arsenic poisoning .\n【37】 Neurologic manifestations — A symmetrical sensorimotor polyneuropathy is one of the most prominent symptoms of arsenic poisoning and can develop one to three weeks after acute poisoning or insidiously from chronic exposures.\n【38】 Sensory symptoms tend to present first and to predominate, starting with numbness and tingling particularly in the soles of the feet and then later in the hands as well . These may be the only symptoms in milder forms of arsenic polyneuropathy.\n【39】 In more severe forms, the pain is more intense, particularly with even light touch, so that affected persons are unable to walk because of intense burning pain in the soles . Cramping in the calves is another common symptom. An early sign on physical examination is diminished vibratory sense.\n【40】 Progressive symptoms may then develop in a stocking/glove distribution with decreased pain, decreased sensation of touch and temperature, and symmetrical weakness, along with decreased deep tendon reflexes. Electrophysiological findings of arsenic neuropathy typically suggest a distal motor and sensory axonopathy .\n【41】 Neurologic findings may also occur with chronic exposure. A study of 43 smelter workers exposed to inorganic arsenic dust for 13 to 45 years found moderate clinical symptoms and nerve conduction velocities that were significantly lower in two peripheral nerves as compared with matching referents . There was a significant negative correlation between cumulative absorption of arsenic and nerve conduction velocities.\n【42】 In a case series examining the health consequences of drinking arsenic-contaminated water in India, a sample of 21 of 40 individuals with skin lesions and elevated arsenic in biological samples were diagnosed with clinical neuropathy . Most of the cases presented with distal paresthesias and distal hypesthesias in stocking and glove distribution, followed by limb pains and diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes in those most affected.\n【43】 In chronic arsenic exposure, peripheral nerve manifestations may also be subclinical. A blinded study of copper smelting factory workers exposed to arsenic trioxide found that the incidence of both subclinical (reduced conduction velocity and amplitude measurements on nerve conduction studies without signs or symptoms of clinical neuropathy) and clinical neuropathy was greater in arsenic-exposed workers than in controls .\n【44】 Although peripheral neuropathy has been the predominant neurologic manifestation of chronic arsenic poisoning, there have also been case reports of encephalopathy, described as cognitive impairment, disorientation, hallucinations, agitations, and memory problems . It is not clear from these case reports, however, how much of the symptoms can be attributed to arsenic and how much to other potential work exposures or psychiatric problems .\n【45】 Cancer — There are many epidemiological studies demonstrating an association between arsenic exposure and various types of malignancies, including cancers of the skin, bladder, kidney, lung, liver, and prostate . This association has been the basis for regulatory actions setting limits for exposure, both environmental and occupational.  'Prevention' below.)\n【46】 Cardiovascular — Some patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with arsenic trioxide have been found to develop QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias .\n【47】 Chronic exposure to high levels of arsenic in drinking water have been associated with hypertension  and prolongation of the QTc interval .\n【48】 A study in Bangladesh found a dose-response relationship between levels of arsenic in drinking water and the prevalence of hypertension . Another large cohort study in Bangladesh found that blood pressure increased to a greater degree among individuals in the highest compared with lowest quartile of arsenic exposure (median follow-up 6.7 years) . This relationship is similar to that\n【49】 In older observational studies, associations were noted between chronic exposure to high levels of arsenic in drinking water (>500 mcg/L) and adverse cardiovascular outcomes (including death). Subsequent studies have found cardiovascular-related deaths associated with lower levels of arsenic exposure as well. In a prospective study of 11,746 men and women in Bangladesh with mean follow-up of 6.6 years, there were 198 cardiovascular deaths of which 29 percent were estimated to be attributable to arsenic levels greater than 12 mcg/L in well water . There was a dose-response relationship between increasing levels of arsenic in the well water and cardiovascular deaths, as well as a synergistic effect with cigarette smoking. A study from the United States also found associations between even low to moderate baseline urine arsenic levels and cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality . In a subsequent study including Colorado residents, lifetime exposure to low-level inorganic arsenic in drinking water was associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease .\n【50】 Some studies have described the effect of arsenic on the vascular endothelial cells and proposed an association between arsenic exposure and the risk of cardiovascular outcomes such as coronary heart disease and stroke ; however, other epidemiologic studies have not found such an association .\n【51】 Liver — Arsenic exposure has been associated with hepatic angiosarcoma  'Cancer' above). A study in Mexico found evidence of increased bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase concentrations in people exposed to arsenic in drinking water . A study of 248 people in India with evidence of chronic arsenic toxicity found that hepatomegaly was present in 77 percent; among a subset who underwent liver biopsy, noncirrhotic portal fibrosis (now referred to as idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension) was the predominant lesion .\n【52】 Endocrine — Some studies have demonstrated an association between arsenic exposure and the development of type II diabetes mellitus . Some incidence and prevalence studies have found a dose-response relationship between exposure to arsenic in drinking water and the risk of diabetes , whereas a large population-based cross-sectional study did not demonstrate an association between low levels of arsenic levels and prevalence of diabetes .\n【53】 Respiratory — Arsenic exposure increases the risk of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea, hemoptysis) and decreased lung function in a dose-response fashion . The risk of lung disease is also higher among those exposed at a younger age. As an example, in one study from northern Chile where the water supply was contaminated by high levels of arsenic for over a decade, children born during the period of contamination had a 12-fold increase in mortality from bronchiectasis, and those exposed under the age of 10 years had a fivefold increase in risk .\n【54】 Mortality — The Health Effects of Arsenic Exposure Longitudinal Study (HEALS) cohort found that chronic arsenic exposure through drinking water (>150 mcg/L) was associated with increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.68, 95% CI 1.26-2.23) and increased cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.92, 95% 1.07-3.43) over seven-year follow-up . Another important finding was that decreasing arsenic exposure after chronic exposure did not reduce an individual's risk of mortality . This implies that, in addition to removing exposure, other strategies are needed to prevent mortality from chronic exposure to arsenic.\n【55】 Other\n【56】 Reproductive and developmental — Since inorganic arsenic has been found to cross the placenta, there is a potential for adverse reproductive and developmental outcomes. There is evidence of increased infant mortality, spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and preterm births associated with maternal arsenic exposure .   \"Occupational and environmental risks to reproduction in females: Specific exposures and impact\", section on 'Reproductive health impact'.)\n【57】 Nursing — Limited data suggest that arsenic levels in breast milk are low even in women exposed to high levels of environmental arsenic . This has potentially important implications for protecting infants from arsenic toxicity in regions where there are high concentrations of arsenic in the drinking water.\n【58】 Childhood exposure — Children, in general, are more susceptible to toxicants, such as arsenic, for a variety of reasons including: more opportunities for exposure from increased hand-to-mouth behavior and breathing closer to the ground, differences in metabolism, and greater sensitivity of the developing nervous system to toxic insults . Children are less able than adults to internally detoxify inorganic arsenic through methylation .\n【59】 Children can become poisoned with arsenic through accidental ingestion, as in the case of two siblings who drank outdated arsenic-containing pesticide stored in a water bottle . Children can also develop arsenic poisoning from playing on soil contaminated with arsenic from nearby mining or smelting or in hazardous waste sites. Another potential source of exposure is through contact with pressure-treated wood through playing on it, chewing it, or being in the vicinity when it is burned.  'Pressure-treated wood' above.)\n【60】 DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION — The evaluation of an individual with potential arsenic toxicity involves taking a medical/environmental history.   \"Overview of occupational and environmental health\", section on 'Occupational and environmental history'.)\n【61】 History and physical examination — The history should identify potential sources of exposures and symptoms consistent with arsenic poisoning.\n【62】 The physical examination should include examination for skin changes, including areas of hyper and hypo pigmentation and hyperkeratotic lesions, Mee's lines in the nails, and peripheral neuropathy.\n【63】 Potential environmental/occupational exposures should be documented and measured. Soil, air, and water can be sampled, if indicated, and arsenic levels determined through reliable laboratories or government agencies. Biological monitoring evidence can also be obtained to confirm excessive arsenic exposure.  'Biologic monitoring' below.)\n【64】 Biologic monitoring — It is important to understand the limitations of all of the tests in order to be able to interpret the result of biologic monitoring.\n【65】 Acute exposure — In the case of an acute ingestion, abdominal radiographs may demonstrate gastrointestinal radiopaque material soon after ingestion, although the absence of opaque material does not rule out exposure. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained to assess the QTc interval as well as cardiac monitoring for tachyarrhythmias. In general, measurement of arsenic levels in urine is preferable to blood, since blood arsenic is cleared rapidly. In an emergency situation, a spot urine arsenic can be obtained prior to beginning chelation therapy. The urine creatinine in the spot sample should also be obtained to correct for urine concentration. During treatment, 24-hour urine arsenic monitoring is usually performed to follow the levels of arsenic excretion over time . If the clinical presentation and history are highly suspicious for acute arsenic poisoning, treatment would need to be started urgently, prior to the return of the test results, which could take days.  'Biologic monitoring' above.)\n【66】 In acutely symptomatic patients, urine arsenic levels are usually in the thousands of micrograms per liter. Because urine arsenic excretion can be intermittent, a definitive diagnosis usually is supported by finding a concentration greater than or equal to 50 mcg/L, or 100 mcg As/g creatinine in the absence of recent fish or shellfish intake, ideally with inorganic arsenic found in the urine .\n【67】 Chronic exposure — In evaluating a patient for chronic arsenic exposure, either a 24-hour urine arsenic or spot urine arsenic and creatinine can be obtained after advising the patient to eat no fish, seaweed, or shellfish for 48 to 72 hours. The 24-hour urine determination is more accurate but less convenient. Regular surveillance for arsenic exposure in workers (for instance, after shifts) is done with measurements of spot urine arsenic and creatinine.   \"\n【68】 Because avoiding fish may not always eliminate non-inorganic species from the total arsenic result, the lab should be instructed to speciate or fractionate the specimen if the total arsenic is elevated, as noted above  'Biologic monitoring' above). If the total arsenic is elevated, but there are little to no inorganic species detected, one can usually assume that the urine arsenic has derived from the non-toxic arsenic species.\n【69】 There have been varying results from studies reporting the relationship between work-related air exposures and urinary arsenic measurements, but based upon studies from copper smelters, 30 to 35 mcg As/g creatinine would be expected from exposure to air levels of arsenic averaging 10 mcg/m3 .\n【70】 There have been studies that measure urinary arsenic levels to determine what are background exposure levels. Urinary levels reflect recent exposures that tend to correlate with arsenic ingestion form drinking water and dietary sources . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) measures a random sample of participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and tests their blood and urine for various chemicals or metabolites, such as arsenic. Results from the 2015 to 2016 survey found that the mean urine total arsenic was 4.41 mcg/L and (creatinine corrected) was 6.69 mcg As/g creatinine; the mean urinary inorganic-related species was 4.94 mcg As/g .\n【71】 Laboratory testing to assess chronic toxicity, including laboratory parameters that could become abnormal days to weeks after an acute overexposure, should include a complete blood count, renal and liver function tests, ECG (looking for persistent QTc prolongation), and a urinalysis. If there are signs or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, nerve conduction/electromyogram (EMG) testing should be obtained.\n【72】 TREATMENT — The first step in treatment is the elimination of further exposure. In cases of acute exposure, care should be taken to avoid contamination of medical personnel during the decontamination process.\n【73】 Acute poisoning — Initial therapy of severe arsenic poisoning relies on the provision of basic and advanced life support. Patients may be acutely ill and require aggressive critical care to preserve organ function . Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), hemodialysis, and exchange transfusion may be helpful, although there are few data supporting their use . Subsequent therapy usually involves chelation . Consultation with a regional poison center and/or clinical toxicologist is recommended to assist with the management of the severely poisoned patient  'Additional resources' below). For pediatric poisonings in the United States, it is also possible to contact one of the regional Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units.\n【74】 Careful attention must be paid to fluid and electrolyte balance.\n【75】 The approach to the patient with acute arsenic poisoning includes:\n【76】 Chelation for acute poisoning — Two chelating agents are available in the United States: dimercaprol (British Anti-Lewisite [BAL]) and meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA, succimer). A third drug, unithiol (sodium 2,3-dimercapto-1-propane sulfonate [DMPS]), may have the most favorable profile for the treatment of acute poisoning by inorganic arsenic. It can be given intravenously but has not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that use in the United States .\n【77】 Both DMPS and DMSA are water-soluble analogs of BAL, have a higher therapeutic index than BAL, and, unlike BAL, do not redistribute arsenic to the brain . In the United States, BAL tends to remain the initial chelating drug for severe, acute arsenic toxicity , particularly if the patient cannot take DMSA (oral) and because DMPS may not be available. The precise dosing for BAL for severe inorganic arsenic exposure poisoning has not been specifically established. Most of the regimens for arsenic treatment, particularly with BAL, rely on studies that are more than 20 years old, but are still recommended by respected toxicological experts . A regimen for adults is 3 to 5 mg/kg of deep intramuscular BAL administered every four to six hours . The endpoint for chelation is a 24-hour urinary arsenic concentration of <50 mcg/L.\n【78】 Since BAL is administered intramuscularly, it can be used in patients with reduced consciousness or decreased gastrointestinal motility. BAL is associated with significant side effects  deficiency. BAL may not be very effective in the presence of arsenic-induced hepatotoxicity . Although BAL helps to speed excretion of arsenic and may help to inhibit some of the toxic effects, it is not clear that administration will prevent the development of the peripheral neuropathy.\n【79】 Chronic or subacute poisoning — There are few data to support the use of chelation in subacute or chronic arsenic poisoning, particularly since arsenic is so quickly excreted. The first order of treatment is identification of the source of exposure and removal from exposure. Therapy for subacute or chronic poisoning in the setting of ongoing or recent arsenic exposure may be reasonable, after all measures to stop exposure have been made and as an effort to more quickly enhance excretion of arsenic.\n【80】 Chelation for chronic poisoning — There are few studies, with significant limitations, regarding the efficacy of chelation therapy (using DMPS or DMSA) in the setting of chronic intoxication . Although chelation therapy may increase arsenic excretion and possibly lower arsenic concentration in some tissues, it is unclear whether or not this results in less morbidity or mortality related to chronic arsenic intoxication . However, if one decides to proceed with chelation therapy for subacute or chronic severe toxicity, DMSA (an oral hydrophilic analogue of BAL) is the chelator of choice . The dosing of DMSA is based on testing in children being treated for lead poisoning. The recommended dose from the manufacturer is 10 mg/kg per dose three times per day for five days, followed by 10 mg/kg per dose twice per day for two weeks. Although we have found this dosing to be acceptable in treating some adults for lead poisoning, the dose can become quite high, especially in heavier adults. Given fewer adult treatment data with DMSA, we have also used an adult dosing level of 500 mg twice per day for two weeks as a sensible maximum limit for treating adults with mild symptomatic lead poisoning, and similar dosing may be appropriate for treating arsenic poisoning until there are additional clinical data available for adults.\n【81】 Adverse effects of chelating agents are listed in a table .\n【82】 DMPS can be administered by oral, intravenous (IV), or intramuscular (IM) routes and one study reported its value in treating chronic arsenic toxicity ; it is not approved in the United States for this use but has been used in other countries . When given IM, it is administered at 5 mg/kg per dose as a 5 percent solution; a typical regimen would be dosing every 6 to 8 hours on the first day, every 8 to 12 hours on the second day, and every 12 to 24 hours thereafter .\n【83】 PREVENTION\n【84】 General issues — Efforts should be taken to reduce exposures to inorganic arsenic, a recognized carcinogen, to the extent feasible, from both naturally occurring and man-made sources . In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulates inorganic arsenic exposure in air in the workplace through a \"permissible exposure limit\" (PEL) of 10 mcg/m3 as a time-weighted average over an eight-hour work day . The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is more conservative and advises minimizing exposures to a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 2 mcg/m3 (15-minute exposure) .\n【85】 The World Health Organization (WHO), in its 1993 guidelines for drinking water quality, reported that based on health criteria the guideline value for arsenic in drinking water should ideally be less than 10 mcg/L, but given measurement limitations the WHO recommended a provisional guideline value of 10 mcg/L .\n【86】 In 2002, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) lowered the maximum contaminant level for the amount of arsenic allowed in drinking water from 50 to 10 ppb (10 mcg/L) based upon review of carcinogenic risks . Although this represented an improvement, and lowering of risks, there were still estimates of excess cancer risk (at 10 mcg/L) among 70 kg resident drinking 1 L of water of day for a lifetime, with estimated lifetime risk, per 10,000: for bladder cancer 12 and 23 (women and men, respectively), lung cancer 18 and 24 (women and men, respectively). At lower levels of arsenic, the estimate lifetime excess risk is lower. Some advocate for lower maximum containment level (MCL).\n【87】 To reduce the exposure to potential arsenic-contaminated rice products, the 2012 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines advised giving children more foods made from wheat and oats , and there are additional strategies for reducing exposure of arsenic in rice. The US Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units advised limiting consumption of foods higher in arsenic content, rinsing rice, limiting rice milk in children younger than 54 months of age, and reducing intake of foods containing high amounts of brown rice syrup .   \"Overview of acquired peripheral neuropathies in children\".)\n【88】 Most of the arsenical pesticides (including the common sodium arsenate ant killer, \"Terro\") were banned for use in the United States in 1991, but they may still be found in use in other countries. Copper chromium arsenate (CCA), used as a wood preservative, was not included in that ban. The use of CCA in pressure-treated wood for residential uses in the United States was supposed to voluntarily cease by December 31, 2003. However, existing structures remain as potential sources of concern. Care should be taken never to burn pressure-treated wood in fireplaces or campfires .\n【89】 Referral — Practitioners involved in the care of patients with arsenic poisoning, or patients who have questions about arsenic exposures, may find it helpful to consult with occupational/environmental medicine clinicians who can assist in the diagnosis of arsenic poisoning, in the arrangement for environmental/work site evaluations and interventions, and in evaluations for worker compensation. Occupational/environmental medicine clinicians can also help with the decision for chelation therapy and administration of appropriate therapy.\n【90】 ADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n【91】 Regional poison control centers — Regional poison control centers in the United States are available at all times for consultation on patients with known or suspected poisoning, and who may be critically ill, require admission, or have clinical pictures that are unclear (1-800-222-1222). In addition, some hospitals have medical toxicologists available for bedside consultation. Whenever available, these are invaluable resources to help in the diagnosis and management of ingestions or overdoses.

Other serious and fatal GI complications (including hemorrhage, obstruction, perforation, erosion, ulcer, enterocolitis, neutropenic colitis, and ileus) have also been reported. The risk for GI complications may be increased in patients with lymphoma with preexisting GI involvement. Prompt diagnostic evaluation and management should be performed if new or worsening GI symptoms (including severe abdominal pain) occur.\n【75】 Hepatic impairment: The incidence of ≥ grade 3 adverse reactions may be increased in patients with moderate or severe impairment (compared to patients with normal hepatic function).\n【76】 Hepatotoxicity: Serious hepatotoxicity, including fatalities, has occurred; cases were consistent with hepatocellular injury, with elevations of transaminases and/or bilirubin. Some have occurred after the initial dose or after rechallenge. The risk for hepatotoxicity may be increased with preexisting liver disease, elevated baseline liver enzymes, and concurrent medications.\n【77】 Hyperglycemia: Hyperglycemia, including new-onset hyperglycemia, exacerbation of pre-existing diabetes mellitus, and ketoacidosis (including fatalities) have been reported, including grade 3 and 4 events. The median time to hyperglycemia onset was 1 month (range: up to 10 months). Hyperglycemia occurred more frequently in patients with increased body mass or diabetes.\n【78】 Infection: Serious infection, including opportunistic infections (eg, pneumonia, bacteremia, sepsis/septic shock) have been reported (some fatal).\n【79】 Infusion reactions/anaphylaxis: Infusion reactions, including anaphylaxis have been reported.\n【80】 Peripheral neuropathy: Peripheral neuropathy is common and is generally cumulative; grades 1 to 4 neuropathy have been reported. Neuropathy is usually sensory, although motor neuropathy has also been observed. Neuropathy completely resolved in over half of patients receiving brentuximab vedotin as monotherapy; almost one-quarter had partial improvement. Neuropathy did not improve in some patients. In patients receiving brentuximab as a single agent, the median time to onset of neuropathy (any grade) was 3 months (range: up to 12 months), and the median time from onset to resolution or improvement of any grade was 5 months (range: up to 45 months). Of patients experiencing ongoing neuropathy, most cases were grade 1, although some patients experienced grade 2 or 3 ongoing neuropathy. In patients receiving brentuximab in combination with chemotherapy, the median time to onset of neuropathy (any grade) was 2 months (range: up to 7 months), with onset for grade 2 neuropathy of 3 months (range: up to 6 months) and grade 3 neuropathy of 4 months (range: up to 7 months). The median time from onset to resolution or improvement of any grade was 4 to ~7 months (range: up to 67 months). Based on an updated analysis, neuropathy completely resolved in a majority of patients receiving brentuximab in combination with chemotherapy; although some patients experienced either partial improvement or no improvement. Of patients experiencing ongoing neuropathy, a majority of cases were grade 1, approximately one fourth of patients had ongoing grade 2 neuropathy, some patients had grade 3 ongoing neuropathy, while a small percentage of patients had grade 4 ongoing neuropathy. Symptoms of neuropathy include hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, burning sensation, neuropathic pain, or weakness.\n【81】 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and death due to JC virus infection have been reported. Immunosuppression due to prior chemotherapy treatments or underlying disease may also contribute to PML development. New-onset signs/symptoms of central nervous system abnormalities include changes in mood, memory, cognition, motor incoordination and/or weakness, speech and/or visual disturbances. The time to initial symptom onset varies from treatment initiation, with some cases occurring within 3 months of initial drug exposure.\n【82】 Pulmonary toxicity: Noninfectious pulmonary toxicity (eg, pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome), some fatal, has been reported in patients receiving brentuximab vedotin.\n【83】 Renal impairment: Due to higher exposure of monomethylauristatin E (MMAE; the microtubule disrupting agent component), the incidence of ≥ grade 3 adverse reactions may be increased in patients with severe impairment (compared to patients with normal kidney function).\n【84】 Tumor lysis syndrome: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) may occur; risk of TLS is higher in patients with a high tumor burden or with rapid tumor proliferation.\n【85】 Bleomycin: Due to the risk for pulmonary injury, concurrent use with bleomycin is contraindicated. In a study comparing brentuximab combined with ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) to brentuximab combined with AVD (doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine), the occurrence of pulmonary toxicity was higher in the brentuximab/ABVD group. Pulmonary symptoms/toxicities reported with brentuximab in combination with ABVD consisted of cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltration/inflammation; most patients responded to corticosteroids.\n【86】 Older adult: Patients ≥65 years of age may be at higher risk for grade 3 or higher adverse events and neutropenic fever when brentuximab vedotin is used in combination with chemotherapy.\n【87】 Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984).

Verify pregnancy status (in females of reproductive potential) prior to treatment initiation. Monitor for infusion reaction. Monitor for signs/symptoms of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (evaluate with MRI, and lumbar puncture or brain biopsy), neuropathy (hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paresthesia, discomfort, burning sensation, or neuropathic pain or weakness), dermatologic toxicity, pulmonary toxicity (new or worsening symptoms such as cough or dyspnea), GI toxicity, tumor lysis syndrome, and/or infection (bacterial, fungal, or viral).\n【185】 The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion (ASCO [Hwang 2020]) recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.\n【186】 Mechanism of Action\n【187】 Brentuximab vedotin is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC) directed at CD30 consisting of 3 components: 1) a CD30-specific chimeric IgG1 antibody cAC10;  2) a microtubule-disrupting agent, monomethylauristatin E (MMAE); and 3) a protease cleavable dipeptide linker (which covalently conjugates MMAE to cAC10). The conjugate binds to cells which express CD30, and forms a complex which is internalized within the cell and releases MMAE. MMAE binds to the tubules and disrupts the cellular microtubule network, inducing cell cycle arrest (G2/M phase) and apoptosis.\n【188】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【189】 Distribution: Vdss: ADC: ~6 to 10 L\n【190】 Protein binding: MMAE: 68% to 82%\n【191】 Metabolism: MMAE: Minimal, primarily via oxidation by CYP3A4/5\n【192】 Half-life elimination: Terminal: ADC: ~4 to 6 days; MMAE: ~3 to 4 days\n【193】 Time to peak: ADC: At end of infusion; MMAE: ~1 to 3 days after the end of infusion\n【194】 Excretion: MMAE: Feces (~72% [of recovered MMAE], primarily unchanged); urine\n【195】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【196】 Altered kidney function: The exposure (AUC) of MMAE, a brentuximab vedotin component, was increased ~2-fold in patients with severe renal impairment receiving a 1.2 mg/kg dose compared to patients with normal renal function.\n【197】 Hepatic function impairment: The exposure (AUC) of MMAE, a brentuximab vedotin component, was increased ~2.3-fold in patients with hepatic impairment receiving a 1.2 mg/kg dose compared to patients with normal hepatic function.\n【198】 Brand Names: International\n【199】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Brentuximab vedotin  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/brentuximab-vedotin-drug-information?search=%E5%8E%9F%E5%8F%91%E7%9A%AE%E8%82%A4CD30%E9%98%B3%E6%80%A7%E9%97%B4%E5%8F%98%E6%80%A7%E5%A4%A7%E7%BB%86%E8%83%9E%E6%B7%8B%E5%B7%B4%E7%98%A4&source=search_result&selectedTitle=34%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:38:45"}

They are most often isolated skin anomalies but may rarely occur as part of complex malformation syndromes.  'Associated syndromes' below.)\n【2】 Capillary malformations are present at birth as blanchable, pink to red patches and may be located anywhere on the body, typically with a unilateral or segmental distribution that respects the midline. They should not be confused with infantile hemangiomas, common vascular tumors of infancy that only in a minority of cases are present at birth. In contrast with infantile hemangiomas, capillary malformations do not regress with time but grow in proportion to the child's growth and become thicker and darker in color during adulthood.   \"Infantile hemangiomas: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and complications\".)\n【3】 The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, and associated syndromes of capillary malformations will be discussed here. Laser treatment of capillary malformations is discussed separately. An overview of vascular lesions in newborns and venous malformations are also discussed separately.\n【4】 EPIDEMIOLOGY — In a prospective study and literature review, capillary malformations occurred in 0.1 to 2 percent of newborns without sex predilection . They are generally sporadic, but familial cases have been reported .\n【5】 PATHOGENESIS — The etiology and pathogenesis of capillary malformations are unknown. Several mechanisms may be involved in their development, including vascular ectasia, lack of neuronal control of blood flow, overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor, and development of compensatory, collateral passageways for venous drainage .\n【6】 In a genome-wide study, a specific somatic mosaic activating mutation in the GNAQ gene on chromosome 9q21,2, encoding the guanine nucleotide binding protein G-alpha-q, was found in skin samples of 12 of 13 participants with nonsyndromic port wine birthmarks and in skin or brain samples of 23 of 26 participants with Sturge-Weber syndrome (a rare congenital disorder characterized by facial capillary malformation and capillary-venous malformations affecting the brain and eye) but in none of six control subjects . This mutation (c.548G→A, resulting in the p.Arg183Gln amino acid substitution) may be involved in abnormal cell proliferation through the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway.   \"Sturge-Weber syndrome\".)\n【7】 Nonsyndromic port wine birthmarks may represent a late origin of the somatic GNAQ mutation in vascular endothelial cells, whereas in Sturge-Weber syndrome mutation may occur earlier during embryogenesis in progenitor cells that are precursors to a larger variety of cell types and tissues, leading to the syndromic phenotype.\n【8】 Inactivating mutations in the RASA1 gene, which cause the autosomal dominant capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome, may be involved in hereditary cases of capillary malformations without arteriovenous malformations . The RAS gene family encodes membrane-associated proteins that are involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation and organization of endothelial cells into highly organized networks .\n【9】 PATHOLOGY — Histologic examination of port wine birthmarks reveals ectatic capillaries and postcapillary venules in the papillary and reticular dermis. The number of vessels is not increased and there is no endothelial proliferation. Later-stage lesions develop progressive fibrosis around the vessels and dilatation of the channels. Decreased nerve density has been demonstrated within affected areas .\n【10】 CLINICAL FEATURES\n【11】 Clinical presentation — Capillary malformations are present at birth as partially or completely blanchable, pink to red or reddish-brown patches, with unilateral or segmental distribution that respects the midline . Lesions are flat, painless, and the same temperature as surrounding skin.\n【12】 The face is a common location, but capillary malformations can occur anywhere on the body . It has also been suggested that the pattern of capillary malformations may correspond to areas of somatic mosaicism or follow the embryonic vasculature . Facial lesions may extend into the mucosal surfaces of the lips and gingivae.\n【13】 In most cases, capillary malformations are isolated cutaneous anomalies. However, they may be associated with other abnormalities (eg, glaucoma and occult spinal dysraphism) or be a component of complex malformation syndromes (eg, Sturge-Weber or Klippel Trenaunay syndrome).  'Associated abnormalities/complications' below and 'Associated syndromes' below.)\n【14】 Clinical course — Capillary malformations do not regress over time but grow proportionally with the child's growth. Untreated lesions may become thicker, darker in color (port wine), and nodular in adulthood .\n【15】 Associated abnormalities/complications\n【16】 Glaucoma — In a retrospective study of 216 children with periocular capillary malformations, 18 percent had glaucoma at presentation or developed glaucoma during a median follow-up of three years . Glaucoma was more common in patients with bilateral port wine birthmarks or involvement of the upper and lower eyelids (distribution areas of V1 and V2 trigeminal branches). A higher prevalence of glaucoma of 40 to 60 percent has been reported in case series of patients with facial capillary malformations associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome . Early-onset glaucoma occurs before age four and causes eye enlargement (buphthalmos), whereas late-onset glaucoma may be delayed until adolescence and is not associated with buphthalmos .   \"Overview of glaucoma in infants and children\", section on 'Secondary glaucoma'.)\n【17】 In patients with facial capillary malformation and glaucoma, brain imaging studies are recommended to exclude leptomeningeal involvement and Sturge-Weber syndrome.   \"Sturge-Weber syndrome\", section on 'Diagnosis'.)\n【18】 Occult spinal dysraphism — The association between isolated capillary malformations located over the lumbar spine and spinal dysraphism is controversial . However, imaging studies to rule out occult spinal dysraphism are recommended when capillary malformations occur in conjunction with other cutaneous abnormalities (eg, hypertrichosis, dermal sinus or pit, lipomas, or deviated gluteal cleft) in the midline lumbosacral area.   \"Closed spinal dysraphism: Pathogenesis and types\".)\n【19】 Soft tissue and bone overgrowth — Soft tissue and/or bone overgrowth are complications of capillary malformations. Maxillary bone and gingival hyperplasia, lip enlargement, and abnormal bite may occur with facial capillary malformations in the V2 distribution . Overgrowth of digits or limbs also may occur with reticulated or extensive lesions localized to the limbs.\n【20】 Thickening and nodularity — In large case series, skin thickening or \"cobblestoning\" with nodular growths within the capillary malformation occurs in up to 65 percent of lesions, especially within those located on the face , arteriovenous malformations, or vascular ectasias . Easy bleeding within these lesions is common.\n【21】 Early treatment may prevent thickening and development of nodularity.   \"Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions\", section on 'Capillary malformations (port wine birthmarks)'.)\n【22】 DIAGNOSIS\n【23】 Clinical — The diagnosis of capillary malformations is in most cases clinical and based upon the appearance, time of onset, and temporal evolution of the skin lesion:\n【24】 Imaging studies — Imaging studies (ultrasonography or magnetic resonance) are not routinely performed in children with capillary malformations. However, imaging studies may be necessary in the evaluation of associated syndromes including:\n【25】 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — The differential diagnosis of capillary malformations includes:\n【26】 INDICATIONS FOR REFERRAL — Neonates presenting with a capillary malformation involving the upper and lower eyelids and the frontotemporal region (V1 and V2 segments) should be referred for ophthalmologic examination to rule out glaucoma.  'Glaucoma' above.)\n【27】 Children with a facial capillary malformation and neurologic symptoms, particularly seizures, should be referred for neurologic examination and neuroimaging studies to exclude Sturge-Weber syndrome.   \"Sturge-Weber syndrome\", section on 'Diagnosis'.)\n【28】 TREATMENT — Capillary malformations may be disfiguring and a source of significant psychologic stress for patients . The goals of treatment are cosmetic improvement (reduction of skin redness) and prevention of complications (eg, thickening, nodularity, or bleeding) .\n【29】 Pulsed dye laser (PDL) therapy is considered the standard of care for the treatment of capillary malformations . It is based on the concept of selective photothermolysis with oxyhemoglobin as the target . PDL treatment irreversibly damages the capillary vessel wall with minimal damage to the overlying epidermis, which leads to lightening of the port wine birthmark without scarring .   \"Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions\", section on 'Capillary malformations (port wine birthmarks)'.)\n【30】 Lesions may recur after treatment. In a 10-year follow-up study of 51 patients treated with PDL for port wine birthmarks, lesions were significantly darker at follow-up than at the time of the last treatment . However, treated lesions remained significantly lighter than they were prior to the start of treatment, supporting the existence of long-lasting, beneficial effects of treatment.\n【31】 The efficacy of PDL is supported by several uncontrolled studies:\n【32】 PDL therapy for capillary malformations is reviewed in detail separately.   \"Laser and light therapy for cutaneous vascular lesions\", section on 'Capillary malformations (port wine birthmarks)'.)\n【33】 ASSOCIATED SYNDROMES\n【34】 Sturge-Weber syndrome — Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by the classic triad of facial port wine birthmark, leptomeningeal angiomatosis, and ocular involvement. The capillary malformation associated with SWS usually occurs in the distribution area of the ophthalmic and/or maxillary branch (segments V1/V2) of the trigeminal nerve  distribution pattern were associated with a high risk of SWS.\n【35】 Mutations in GNA11 have also been reported in several cases of SWS with distinct characteristics . These patients have the typical, large, facial capillary malformation and glaucoma but have less severe neurologic symptoms. A distinguishing feature in this phenotype is diffuse, reticulated capillary malformations of the trunk and limbs with associated hyper- or hypotrophy.\n【36】 The clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of SWS are discussed in detail separately.   \"Sturge-Weber syndrome\".)\n【37】 Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome — Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is characterized by capillary malformations, venous and lymphatic malformations, and soft tissue and bone hypertrophy involving a limb . The lower limbs, sometimes with extension to the trunk, are more frequently involved than the upper limbs.\n【38】 The capillary malformations are present at birth as extensive, geographic patches located on the trunk or extremity . KTS is caused by somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene .\n【39】 The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and management of KTS are discussed in detail separately.   \"Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\".)\n【40】 Parkes Weber syndrome — Parkes Weber syndrome is characterized by a large capillary malformation on an extremity; soft tissue and bone hypertrophy of the affected limb; and multiple microscopic, fast-flow arteriovenous shunts. The capillary malformation of Parkes Weber syndrome is indistinguishable from the port wine birthmark seen in KTS. Ultrasonography, MRI, and magnetic resonance arteriography are helpful in differentiating Parkes Weber syndrome from KTS. Parkes Weber syndrome has been associated with germline and somatic variants in RASA1  and, in a minority of cases, with germline variants in EPHB4 .\n【41】 Patients with Parkes Weber syndrome have progressive overgrowth of the affected limb and complications related to the arteriovenous shunts, including ulcerations and high-output cardiac failure, especially in the neonatal period.   \"Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\", section on 'Parkes Weber syndrome'.)\n【42】 Servelle-Martorell syndrome — Servelle-Martorell syndrome is a rare congenital angiodysplastic disease . It manifests with capillary malformations and varicosities similar to KTS but is associated with progressive limb hypotrophy rather than overgrowth.\n【43】 Proteus syndrome — Proteus syndrome is an extremely rare disorder characterized by asymmetric and disproportionate overgrowth of body parts  . Mosaicism for a somatic activating mutation in the AKT1 oncogene is thought to be the cause of Proteus syndrome.\n【44】 Cutaneous findings are present in approximately 40 percent of neonates and include capillary, lymphatic, or venous malformations; linear and nonlinear epidermal nevi; cerebriform connective tissue nevi; lipomatous tissue overgrowth or lipoatrophy; café-au-lait macules; and nail abnormalities . The vascular malformations are usually extensive, covering a large portion of the body, and may be associated with visceral vascular malformations. Cerebriform epidermal nevi occur predominantly on soles and palms . Overgrowth is evident at birth in approximately 20 percent of cases and is asymmetric, disproportionate, and progressive. It may involve many tissues including bone, cartilage, muscle, and connective tissue.\n【45】 CLOVES syndrome — CLOVES (congenital lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, spinal/skeletal anomalies/scoliosis) syndrome is a very rare congenital disorder caused by somatic mosaic activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene .   \"Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\", section on 'CLOVES syndrome'.)\n【46】 Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome — Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome, which is incorporated into Cowden syndrome-1 (MIM #158350), is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN . Cutaneous features include capillary, venous, and lymphatic malformations as well as lipomas and pigmented macules on the genitalia. Associated findings include macrocephaly, pseudopapilledema, intellectual disability, and juvenile intestinal polyposis.\n【47】 Cowden syndrome-1 is discussed separately.   \"PTEN hamartoma tumor syndromes, including Cowden syndrome\", section on 'Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome'.)\n【48】 Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome — Capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by atypical, cutaneous capillary malformations in conjunction with an arteriovenous malformation. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RASA1 gene (CM-AVM1; MIM #608354) or in the EPHB4 gene (CM-AVM2; MIM #618196) . RASA1 encodes a guanine nucleotide-binding protein (p21) involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation and organization of endothelial cells into highly organized networks . EPHB4 encodes the ephrin receptor EphB4, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase.\n【49】 Capillary malformations occur in nearly 100 percent of patients with either CM-AVM1 or CM-AVM2. They are usually multiple round to oval, pink-red or tan patches of 1 to 2 cm in size, sometimes with a pale halo, scattered randomly on the body (predominantly on the face and limbs). New lesions may continue to appear throughout childhood.\n【50】 Fast-flow arteriovenous malformations have been reported in approximately 30 and 20 percent of patients with CM-AVM1 and CM-AVM2, respectively . They can be located in the soft tissues, muscles, bones, brain, or spine . Arteriovenous malformations in the central nervous system are more common in CM-AVM1 than in CM-AVM2 (10 versus 3 percent, respectively). Of note, vein of Galen aneurysmal malformations have been reported in CM-AVM2 .\n【51】 Approximately 8 percent of patients have a Parkes Weber syndrome phenotype  'Parkes Weber syndrome' above). Other clinical findings include telangiectasias, lymphatic malformations, and cardiac failure due to volume overload .\n【52】 In patients with clinical findings that suggest CM-AVM syndrome, genetic testing for a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RASA1 or EPHB4 is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\n【53】 Macrocephaly-capillary malformation syndrome — Macrocephaly-capillary malformation (M-CM) syndrome (previously named macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita) is a genetic syndrome characterized by an enlarged head circumference and patchy, reticular capillary malformations . It is caused by mutations in the PIK3CA gene, leading to gain of function and activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway, which is involved in cell growth, proliferation, survival, and apoptosis .\n【54】 The diagnosis is based upon the presence of two major clinical criteria and at least two minor criteria.\n【55】 Major criteria are:\n【56】 Minor criteria are:\n【57】 The capillary malformations are usually reticulated and widespread on the trunk and extremities. Cardiac abnormalities including aortic coarctation have also been described . Neuroimaging findings include white matter abnormalities, ventriculomegaly, cerebral asymmetry, cortical dysplasia, polymicrogyria-like changes, and cerebellar tonsil herniation .\n【58】 Microcephaly-capillary malformation syndrome — Microcephaly-capillary malformation (MIM #614261) is an autosomal recessive syndrome due to mutations in the STAMBP gene on chromosome 2p13.1, encoding a deubiquitinating enzyme . It presents with:\n【59】 The capillary malformations range in size from 2 to 15 mm and are scattered on the trunk, extremities, and head. Minor heart malformations, including small atrial and ventricular septal defects, have also been reported . Neuroimaging findings include diffusely reduced number of gyri with shallow sulci consistent with a severe simplified gyral pattern, and moderately enlarged extra-axial space .\n【60】 Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome — Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a congenital overgrowth syndrome with major features including anterior abdominal wall defects, macroglossia, gigantism, and a propensity to develop specific tumors (hepatoblastoma, Wilms tumour, neuroblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma) . Infants have centrofacial capillary malformations similar to nevus simplex in the majority of cases. Vascular lesions may extend to the upper eyelids, upper lip, and nose. Characteristic-associated findings are an anterior ear lobe crease and posterior helical ear pits.\n【61】 Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is discussed separately.   \"Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\".)\n【62】 Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis — Phakomatosis pigmentovascularis is a syndrome associated with mosaic activating variants of the GNA11 and GNAQ genes and is characterized by the association of a widespread capillary malformation with pigmented lesions including dermal melanocytosis, nevus spilus, mosaic hyperpigmentation, and epidermal nevus . Nevus anemicus and café-au-lait spots can be associated findings. Extracutaneous findings include visceral, muscular, neurologic, or ocular abnormalities.\n【63】 Five types of phakomatosis pigmentovascularis have been identified based upon the type of pigmented lesion associated with the capillary malformation; for each type, subtype \"a\" denotes absence and subtype \"b\" presence of extracutaneous findings\n【64】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Vascular anomalies\".)\n", "title": "毛细血管畸形(葡萄酒色斑)及相关综合征", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/capillary-malformations-port-wine-birthmarks-and-associated-syndromes?search=%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E4%BB%A5%E7%9A%AE%E8%82%A4%E6%88%96%E9%BB%8F%E8%86%9C%E5%BC%82%E5%B8%B8%E4%B8%BA%E4%B8%BB%E8%A6%81%E7%89%B9%E5%BE%81%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%BC%E5%90%88%E5%BE%81&source=search_result&selectedTitle=22%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 21:59:01"}

Infusion-related adverse effects may increase with higher doses (ESCMID/EUCAST [Tsuji 2019]; John 2017). Due to minimal data in morbidly obese patients, consider dosing based on adjusted body weight in these patients (Kassamali 2015; Pai 2013; Sandri 2013a).\n【19】 Dosing: Older Adult\n【20】 Refer to adult dosing.\n【21】 Dosing: Pediatric\n【22】 CNS infection\n【23】 Dosing: Kidney Impairment: Pediatric\n【24】 Dosing: Hepatic Impairment: Pediatric\n【25】 There are no dosage adjustments provided in manufacturer's labeling\n【26】 Adverse Reactions\n【27】 The following adverse drug reactions are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.\n【28】 Postmarketing:\n【29】 Dermatologic: Desquamation (Wen 2020), skin hyperpigmentation (Wen 2020), urticaria\n【30】 Endocrine & metabolic: Albuminuria, hypocalcemia (Goldin 2022), hypochloremia (O’Regan 1977), hypokalemia (Goldin 2022), hypomagnesemia (Goldin 2022), hyponatremia (O’Regan 1977)\n【31】 Gastrointestinal: Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhea\n【32】 Genitourinary: Azotemia\n【33】 Local: Local thrombophlebitis (IV injection site), pain at injection site (IM injection site)\n【34】 Nervous system: Drug fever, meningism (with intrathecal administration), neurotoxicity (including asthenia, ataxia, blurred vision, dizziness, drowsiness, facial flushing, irritability, numbness of extremities, peripheral paresthesia [including oral paresthesia and stocking glove]) (Xing 2021)\n【35】 Neuromuscular & skeletal: Rhabdomyolysis (Ni 2020), state of neuromuscular blockade (including respiratory paralysis [Ning 2022]),\n【36】 Renal: Casts in urine, nephrotoxicity (Zavascki 2017), renal tubular disease (Goldin 2022)\n【37】 Contraindications\n【38】 Hypersensitivity to polymyxin B or any component of the formulation\n【39】 Warnings/Precautions\n【40】 Local reactions: May cause severe pain at IM injection site or thrombophlebitis at IV infusion site.\n【41】 Nephrotoxicity: [US Boxed Warning]: May cause nephrotoxicity; avoid concurrent or sequential use of other nephrotoxic drugs. Usual risk factors include preexisting renal impairment, advanced age and dehydration. Polymyxin B-induced nephrotoxicity may be manifested by albuminuria, cellular casts, and azotemia; monitor BUN, serum creatinine, and urinary analysis at baseline and as clinically indicated. Discontinue therapy with decreasing urinary output and increasing BUN. Data suggest polymyxin B undergoes a selective uptake process into renal cells, which plays a primary role in nephrotoxicity potential (Abdelraouf 2014). One small study in patients receiving polymyxin B with a normal baseline renal function observed an overall prevalence rate of nephrotoxicity of 46% with a median onset of 9 days (Dubrovaskaya 2015).\n【42】 Neurotoxicity: [US Boxed Warning]: May cause neurotoxicity, which can also result in respiratory paralysis from neuromuscular blockade especially when the drug is given soon after anesthesia or muscle relaxants. Avoid concurrent or sequential use of other neurotoxic drugs. Avoid concurrent use of curariform muscle relaxants and other neurotoxic drugs (eg, ether, tubocurarine, succinylcholine, gallamine, decamethonium, sodium citrate), which may cause respiratory depression.\n【43】 Superinfection: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection, including C. difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis; CDAD has been observed >2 months postantibiotic treatment.\n【44】 Renal impairment: Manufacturer labeling recommends a dosage reduction in kidney impairment, and some additional studies suggest a relationship between kidney function and polymyxin B clearance (Avedissian 2018; Manchandani 2018; Yu 2021). However, the majority of clinical data suggest that total body clearance of polymyxin B is not altered substantially in kidney impairment (Kwa 2011; Sandri 2013a; Thamlikitkul 2016; Zavascki 2008). Decreasing daily doses in renal impairment may lead to suboptimal plasma exposure, adverse clinical outcomes, clinical failures, and resistance development (Elias 2010; ESCMID/EUCAST [Tsuji 2019]; Nelson 2015; Sandri 2013a; Zavascki 2008).\n【45】 Pregnancy: [US Boxed Warning]: Safety in pregnant women not established.\n【46】 IM/Intrathecal/IV administration: [US Boxed Warning]: Intramuscular/intrathecal/intravenous administration only to hospitalized patients.\n【47】 Parenteral administration: Polymyxin B sulfate is most toxic when given parenterally; avoid parenteral use whenever possible.\n【48】 Dosage Forms: US\n【49】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【50】 Solution Reconstituted, Injection:\n【51】 Generic: 500,000 units (1 ea)\n【52】 Solution Reconstituted, Injection [preservative free]:\n【53】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【54】 Yes\n【55】 Pricing: US\n【56】 500000 unit (per each): $6.54 - $17.50\n【57】 Administration: Adult\n【58】 Administration: Pediatric\n【59】 Parenteral:\n【60】 IV: Infuse over 60 to 90 minutes (Salvatore 2011; ESCMID/EUCAST [Tsuji 2019]) or by continuous infusion (per manufacturer's labeling).\n【61】 IM: Not recommended for routine use in infants and children because of the severe pain associated with injection; should only be administered to hospitalized patients.\n【62】 Intrathecal: May be administered intrathecally; only administer intrathecally to hospitalized patients.\n【63】 Ophthalmic: May be administered as a subconjunctival injection or as topical ophthalmic drops.\n【64】 Use: Labeled Indications\n【65】 In meningeal infections, polymyxin B sulfate should be administered only by the intrathecal route.\n【66】 Medication Safety Issues\n【67】 High alert medication:\n【68】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【69】 None known.\n【70】 Drug Interactions\n【71】 Aminoglycosides: Polymyxin B may enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Aminoglycosides.

Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【78】 Cefazedone: May enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Polymyxin B. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【79】 Cholera Vaccine: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Cholera Vaccine.  Management: Avoid cholera vaccine in patients receiving systemic antibiotics, and within 14 days following the use of oral or parenteral antibiotics. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【80】 Colistimethate: May enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Polymyxin B. Polymyxin B may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking effect of Colistimethate. Colistimethate may enhance the neurotoxic effect of Polymyxin B. Management: Coadministration of polymyxin B and other potentially neurotoxic or nephrotoxic agents, such as colistimethate, is generally not recommended. If this combination must be used, monitor carefully for enhanced neurotoxic and nephrotoxic effects. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【81】 Fecal Microbiota (Live) (Oral): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Antibiotics. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【82】 Fecal Microbiota (Live) (Rectal): Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Fecal Microbiota (Live) (Rectal).  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【83】 Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (Anti-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -CTLA4 Therapies): Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (Anti-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -CTLA4 Therapies).  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【84】 Kanamycin: Polymyxin B may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Kanamycin.  Management: Coadministration of kanamycin and other potentially ototoxic or nephrotoxic agents, such as polymyxin B, is not recommended. If this combination must be used, monitor carefully neurotoxic, ototoxic, or nephrotoxic effects. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【85】 Lactobacillus and Estriol: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Lactobacillus and Estriol.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【86】 Mecamylamine: Polymyxin B may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking effect of Mecamylamine.  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【87】 Methoxyflurane: May enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Polymyxin B. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【88】 Netilmicin (Ophthalmic): Polymyxin B may enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Netilmicin (Ophthalmic).  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【89】 Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents: Polymyxin B may enhance the neuromuscular-blocking effect of Neuromuscular-Blocking Agents.  Management: If possible, avoid concomitant use of neuromuscular-blocking agents and polymyxin B. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor for deeper, prolonged neuromuscular-blocking effects (eg, respiratory paralysis) in patients receiving this combination. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【90】 Sodium Picosulfate: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Sodium Picosulfate.  Management: Consider using an alternative product for bowel cleansing prior to a colonoscopy in patients who have recently used or are concurrently using an antibiotic. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【91】 Typhoid Vaccine: Antibiotics may diminish the therapeutic effect of Typhoid Vaccine. Only the live attenuated Ty21a strain is affected.  Management: Avoid use of live attenuated typhoid vaccine (Ty21a)  in patients being treated with systemic antibacterial agents. Postpone vaccination until 3 days after cessation of antibiotics and avoid starting antibiotics within 3 days of last vaccine dose. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【92】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【93】 Limited data related to systemic use in pregnancy are available (Heinonen 1977; Kazy 2005).

The duration and severity of hyperglycemia and the metabolic syndrome are the two important risk factors for the development of diabetic neuropathy in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes.\n【2】 This topic will address the pathogenesis of diabetic polyneuropathy. Other aspects of diabetic neuropathy are discussed separately.   \"Epidemiology and classification of diabetic neuropathy\" and  \"Screening for diabetic polyneuropathy\" and  \"Management of diabetic neuropathy\".)\n【3】 PATHOLOGY — Axons from motor neurons in the spinal cord relay signals to muscles, while axons from sensory neurons at the dorsal root ganglia receive signals from skin and joints. Supporting these axons presents a unique challenge, as they are frequently 20,000 times longer than their corresponding cell bodies. Schwann cells provide supporting myelin for axons in the peripheral nervous system, but most sensory axons are unmyelinated, making them more susceptible to damage than motor axons.\n【4】 Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is the most common form of diabetic neuropathy . The cause is a length-dependent \"dying back\" axonopathy, primarily involving the distal portions of the longest myelinated and unmyelinated sensory axons, with relative sparing of motor axons . Though distal \"dying back\" is commonly seen, there is also evidence for proximal nerve dysfunction at the sensory ganglia, which may contribute to this phenomenon .\n【5】 Distal symmetric polyneuropathy is morphologically and functionally indistinguishable from many other \"metabolic\" neuropathies, including uremic neuropathy and alcoholic neuropathy. However, in diabetic neuropathy, morphologic abnormalities of the vasa nervorum are present early in the course of the disease and may parallel the severity of the nerve fiber loss . Thus, the morphologic characteristics of diabetic neuropathy support a vascular component, although most damage is likely secondary to metabolic impairment and loss of required energy in the distal sensory axons .\n【6】 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY — In diabetes, a complex array of metabolic and vascular factors shift the balance between nerve fiber damage and nerve fiber repair in favor of damage . This occurs in a fiber-selective pattern that preferentially affects the more vulnerable distal sensory and autonomic fibers, leading to the progressive loss of sensation that underlies the clinical manifestations of diabetic polyneuropathy.\n【7】 Understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy has evolved from the idea that one single disrupted metabolic pathway was responsible for disease, to the realization that multiple differentially regulated pathways converge to promote mitochondrial dysfunction with bioenergetic failure and oxidative damage of axons .\n【8】 Metabolism\n【9】 Energy production — Circulating glucose and lipids serve as energy sources for the peripheral nervous system. Glucose, via glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA), and lipids, via beta-oxidation, produce two dinucleotide cofactors central to metabolism: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). These cofactors are shuttled into the mitochondria as a source of cellular energy to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via oxidative phosphorylation . Natural byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation are reactive oxygen species (ROS), including superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and catalase. Produced in low levels, ROS are required for normal physiology with essential roles in immunity and cardiovascular tone .\n【10】 People with diabetes have excess circulating glucose and lipids, which overwhelm the normal production of ATP, resulting in increased ROS production, energy failure, and loss of normal cellular function . As an example, increased ROS disrupt endoplasmic reticulum function, leading to protein misfolding and cellular injury . Increased ROS also directly damage mitochondria, disrupt normal cellular signaling, and produce significant cellular damage, resulting in a vicious feed-forward cycle of energy failure and loss of normal function . These disrupted processes occur throughout all cell types in the peripheral nervous system in diabetes . Importantly, injured mitochondria can no longer travel down the axons, and this disruption in normal mitochondrial axonal trafficking underlies the distal to proximal pattern of axonal damage observed in diabetic neuropathy .\n【11】 Other metabolic pathways — Several other metabolic pathways have been studied in the context of diabetic neuropathy, including as potential therapeutic targets . In light of the emerging importance of bioenergetics in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy, future therapeutic efforts will need to address both energy homeostasis and specific metabolic pathway abnormalities.\n【12】 Unifying mechanism — The concept of oxidative stress provides a unifying mechanism for neural damage and for the onset and progression of diabetic neuropathy. Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia disrupt peripheral nervous system energy production and result in ROS, with resulting nerve injury and dysfunction. Changes in the polyol and hexosamine pathways, along with AGE formation, further promote oxidative damage.\n【13】 Because different metabolic impairments are tightly interrelated, a vicious feed-forward cycle of altered metabolism, ROS accumulation, and reduced antioxidant defense occurs. This leads to peripheral nerve damage and the signs and symptoms of diabetic neuropathy  .\n【14】 In support of a role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathy, patients with diabetes who are treated with antioxidants show clinically meaningful improvements in neuropathic symptoms and neuropathic deficits .   \"Management of diabetic neuropathy\".)\n【15】 Role of ischemia — Nerve ischemia was initially invoked in the pathogenesis of diabetic polyneuropathy because of morphologic evidence on sural nerve biopsies as well as the presence of thickened endoneurial blood vessel walls and vascular occlusions at autopsy . Ischemia is secondary to well-documented endothelial dysfunction in diabetes, with loss of vasodilation and increased vasoconstriction .\n【16】 Ischemic and metabolic factors may operate together . Ischemia itself has metabolic consequences that may be exacerbated by insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia . Inflammation, specifically acute-phase reactants and interleukins, may also play a role .\n【17】 Role of nerve fiber repair — Peripheral nerve repair is impaired in diabetes . This complication may be due to disease-induced loss of neurotrophic peptides that normally mediate nerve repair, regeneration, and tonic maintenance. These peptides include nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, the insulin-like growth factors, and vascular endothelial growth factor . Additionally, insulin functions as a neurotrophic factor to peripheral neurons, and thus loss of insulin in type 1 diabetes may compromise nerve viability and repair .\n【18】 Studies in laboratory animals suggest that expression of nerve growth factor and other neurotrophic factors may be decreased in diabetes, which could lead to decreased repair and perhaps impaired maintenance of peripheral nerve fibers .\n【19】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Neuropathy\".)\n【20】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

An increased risk of pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity and/or neuropathy may exist. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【105】 Levomethadone: May decrease the serum concentration of Stavudine. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【106】 Methadone: May decrease the serum concentration of Stavudine. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【107】 Orlistat: May decrease the serum concentration of Antiretroviral Agents. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【108】 Zidovudine: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Stavudine. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【109】 Dietary Considerations\n【110】 May be taken without regard to meals. Some products may contain sucrose.\n【111】 Reproductive Considerations\n【112】 Based on the Health and Humans Services perinatal HIV guidelines, stavudine is not one of the recommended antiretroviral agents for use in patients with HIV infection who are trying to conceive.\n【113】 Viral suppression sustained below the limits of detection with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and modification of therapy (if needed) is recommended in all patients with HIV infection who are planning a pregnancy. Optimization of the health of the person who will become pregnant and a discussion of the potential risks and benefits of ART during pregnancy is also recommended prior to conception. In most cases, recommendations from the HHS perinatal HIV guidelines (based on data obtained from cisgender women) can be applied to transgender and gender diverse people assigned female sex at birth.\n【114】 Health care providers caring for couples planning a pregnancy when one or both partners are diagnosed with HIV infection may contact the National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448-8765) for clinical consultation (HHS [perinatal] 2021).\n【115】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【116】 Stavudine crosses the placenta.\n【117】 Outcome information specific to stavudine use in pregnancy is no longer being reviewed and updated in the Health and Humans Services (HHS) perinatal guidelines. Fatal lactic acidosis has been reported in pregnant individuals using didanosine and stavudine in combination with other antiretroviral agents; coadministration of stavudine and didanosine is contraindicated. The HHS perinatal HIV guidelines do not recommend stavudine use in pregnant patients due to toxicity, and patients who are pregnant should be changed to a preferred or alternative therapy.\n【118】 Maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm delivery, stillbirth, low birth weight, and small-for-gestational-age infants. Actual risks may be influenced by maternal factors such as disease severity, gestational age at initiation of therapy, and specific ART regimen; therefore, close fetal monitoring is recommended. Because there is clear benefit to appropriate treatment, maternal ART should not be withheld due to concerns for adverse neonatal outcomes. Long-term follow-up is recommended for all infants exposed to antiretroviral medications; children not diagnosed with HIV infection but who were exposed to ART in utero or as a neonate and develop significant organ system abnormalities of unknown etiology (particularly of the CNS or heart) should be evaluated for potential metabolic dysfunction.\n【119】 ART is recommended for all pregnant people with HIV infection to maximize their health, maintain the viral load below the limit of detection and reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. Therapy should be individualized following a discussion of the potential risks and benefits of treatment during pregnancy. Patients on fully suppressive regimens prior to pregnancy generally may continue the same regimen considering known pregnancy outcomes and pharmacokinetic data. Monitoring of patients who are pregnant is more frequent than in patients who are not pregnant. ART initiated during pregnancy can be modified after delivery. In most cases, recommendations from the HHS perinatal HIV guidelines (based on data obtained from cisgender women) can be applied to transgender and gender diverse people assigned female sex at birth.\n【120】 Health care providers caring for pregnant patients with HIV infection and their infants may contact the National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448-8765) for clinical consultation (HHS [perinatal] 2021).\n【121】 Monitoring Parameters\n【122】 Serum electrolytes (including anion gap), glucose, uric acid, SCr, lipid profiles, hepatic function tests, serum amylase (baseline and periodically with therapy or if clinical presentation indicates need); serum lactate (if clinical presentation indicates need). To monitor for portal hypertension: CBC with platelet count, splenomegaly on physical exam, liver enzymes, serum bilirubin, albumin, INR, ultrasound.\n【123】 Mechanism of Action\n【124】 Stavudine is a thymidine analog which interferes with HIV viral DNA dependent DNA polymerase resulting in inhibition of viral replication; nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor\n【125】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【126】 Absorption: Rapid\n【127】 Distribution: Penetrates into the CSF achieving 16% to 97% (mean: 59%) of concomitant plasma concentrations; distributes into extravascular spaces and equally between RBCs and plasma\n【128】 Vd: Children: 0.73 ± 0.32 L/kg; Adults: 46 ± 21 L\n【129】 Protein binding: Negligible\n【130】 Metabolism: Converted intracellularly to active triphosphate form; metabolism of stavudine plays minimal role in its clearance; minor metabolites include oxidized stavudine and its glucuronide conjugate, glucuronide conjugate of stavudine, N-acetylcysteine conjugate of the ribose after glycosidic cleavage\n【131】 Bioavailability: Capsule and solution are bioequivalent; Children: 76.9%; Adults: 86.4%\n【132】 Half-life elimination: Note: Half-life is prolonged with renal dysfunction\n【133】 Newborns (at birth): 5.3 ± 2 hours\n【134】 Neonates 14 to 28 days old: 1.6 ± 0.3 hours\n【135】 Children 5 weeks to 15 years: 0.9 ± 0.3 hours\n【136】 Adults: 1.6 ± 0.2 hours\n【137】 Intracellular: Adults: 3.5 to 7 hours\n【138】 Time to peak, serum: 1 hour\n【139】 Excretion: Urine 95% (74% as unchanged drug); feces 3% (62% as unchanged drug)\n【140】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【141】 Altered kidney function: Oral Cl decreases and terminal elimination half-life increases in patients with renal insufficiency.

If refrigerated, allow to stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes (single-use prefilled autoinjector or single-use prefilled syringe) or at least 45 minutes (single-use on-body infusor with prefilled cartridge) prior to use; do not warm with heat or hot water. Administer SUBQ into areas of the abdomen (except for the 2-inch area around the navel), thigh, or upper arm; only use areas that are not tender, bruised, red, or indurated; avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. Rotate the injection site with each injection.\n【74】 Single-use infusor with prefilled cartridge: Administer SUBQ over 5 minutes. Administer medication within 5 minutes of inserting cartridge. Do not use if infusor gets wet (contains electronics that should remain dry), or if dropped onto a hard surface (parts that are not visible may be broken). Use in pediatric patients should be under adult supervision.\n【75】 Single-use prefilled autoinjector or single-use prefilled syringe: For autoinjector, administer medication within 5 minutes of removing orange cap; injection should take ~15 seconds.

Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【83】 Rozanolixizumab: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Fc Receptor-Binding Agents. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【84】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【85】 Evolocumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG2). Potential placental transfer of human IgG is dependent upon the IgG subclass and gestational age, generally increasing as pregnancy progresses. The lowest exposure would be expected during the period of organogenesis (Palmeira 2012; Pentsuk 2009).\n【86】 A pregnancy safety study is underway. If evolocumab is administered during pregnancy, health care providers should report exposure to Amgen’s pregnancy safety study (1-800-772-6436).\n【87】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【88】 It is not known if evolocumab is present in breast milk.\n【89】 However, IgG antibodies are present in human milk; available data suggest that concentrations do not reach the neonatal circulation in substantial amounts. According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother.\n【90】 Monitoring Parameters\n【91】 Lipid profile (fasting or nonfasting) before initiating treatment; fasting lipid profile should be rechecked 4 to 12 weeks after starting therapy and every 3 to 12 months thereafter (AHA/ACC [Grundy 2018]); low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol as appropriate (4 weeks after starting therapy and just prior to the next scheduled dose); signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions.\n【92】 Mechanism of Action\n【93】 Evolocumab is a human monoclonal antibody (IgG2 isotype) that binds to proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9).  PCSK9 binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLR) on hepatocyte surfaces to promote LDLR degradation within the liver. LDLR is the primary receptor that clears circulating LDL; therefore, the decrease in LDLR levels by PCSK9 results in higher blood levels of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C). By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, evolocumab increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.\n【94】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【95】 Onset: Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) suppression: 4 hours.\n【96】 Distribution: IV: Vd: ~3.3 L.\n【97】 Metabolism: Nonsaturable proteolysis.\n【98】 Bioavailability: SUBQ: 72%.\n【99】 Half-life elimination: 11 to 17 days.\n【100】 Time to peak: SUBQ: 3 to 4 days.\n【101】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【102】 Hepatic function impairment: In patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, a 20% to 30% lower mean Cmax and 40% to 50% lower mean AUC occurs.\n【103】 Brand Names: International\n【104】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Evolocumab  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/evolocumab-drug-information?search=%E5%8E%9F%E5%8F%91%E6%80%A7%E9%AB%98%E8%83%86%E5%9B%BA%E9%86%87%E8%A1%80%E7%97%87&source=search_result&selectedTitle=21%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 21:49:57"}

Progressive hepatic coma leading to death has been reported in patients with extensive tumor burden due to metastatic disease, especially those with a baseline albumin <30 g/L. Patients with hepatic impairment were excluded from clinical studies for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).\n【73】 Injection-site reactions: Injection site reactions commonly occurred with SUBQ azacitidine administration.\n【74】 Nephrotoxicity: Kidney toxicities, including serum creatinine elevations, renal tubular acidosis (serum bicarbonate decrease to <20 mEq/L associated with alkaline urine and serum potassium <3 mEq/L), and kidney failure (some fatal), have been reported with IV azacitidine when used in combination with other chemotherapy agents. Patients with kidney impairment may be at increased risk for kidney toxicity. Patients with kidney impairment were excluded from clinical studies for MDS and JMML.\n【75】 Tumor lysis syndrome: May cause serious or fatal tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). TLS has occurred despite receiving antihyperuricemic therapy (eg, allopurinol).\n【76】 Myelodysplastic syndromes: In a clinical trial of patients with RBC transfusion-dependent anemia and thrombocytopenia due to MDS, patients were randomized to receive oral azacitidine (300 mg once daily for 21 days every 28 days) versus placebo; patients received oral azacitidine for a median of 5 cycles. Enrollment was discontinued early in the trial due to a higher incidence of early fatal and/or serious adverse reactions in the azacitidine arm; sepsis was the most frequent fatal adverse reaction. Safety and efficacy of oral azacitidine for treatment of MDS have not been established, and treatment of MDS with oral azacitidine outside of a clinical trial is not recommended.\n【77】 Do not substitute: Do not substitute azacitidine tablets for azacitidine injection (or vice versa); indications, dosages, and pharmacokinetics are different. Treatment of patients using IV or SUBQ azacitidine at the recommended tablet dosage may result in a fatal adverse reaction; treatment of patients using azacitidine tablets at the doses recommended for IV or SUBQ azacitidine may not be effective.\n【78】 Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984).

Risk X: Avoid combination\n【177】 Reproductive Considerations\n【178】 Verify pregnancy status prior to therapy in patients who could become pregnant. Patients who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy and for at least 6 months after the last azacitidine dose. Patients with partners who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy and for at least 3 months after the last azacitidine dose.\n【179】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【180】 Based on its mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, in utero exposure to azacitidine may cause fetal harm. Information related to the use of azacitidine for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in pregnancy is limited (Alrajhi 2019; Mahdi 2018).\n【181】 The European Society for Medical Oncology has published guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of cancer during pregnancy (ESMO [Peccatori 2013]). Guidelines are also available for the treatment of AML in pregnancy (BCSH [Ali 2015]). The guidelines recommend referral to a facility with expertise in cancer during pregnancy and encourage a multidisciplinary team (obstetrician, neonatologist, oncology team). If chemotherapy is indicated, it should not be administered in the first trimester but may begin in the second trimester. There should be a 3-week time period between the last chemotherapy dose and anticipated delivery, and chemotherapy should not be administered beyond week 33 of gestation (Ali 2015; ESMO [Peccatori 2013]).\n【182】 A pregnancy registry is available for all cancers diagnosed during pregnancy at Cooper Health (1-877-635-4499).\n【183】 Monitoring Parameters\n【184】 Liver function tests (baseline), electrolytes (baseline and prior to each cycle), CBC with differential and platelets (baseline and prior to each cycle, more frequently if indicated), renal function tests (at minimum, serum bicarbonate, BUN, and SCr at baseline and prior to each cycle). Assess risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) prior to treatment and monitor for signs/symptoms of TLS. Also monitor for hematologic response, nausea/vomiting, and for injection-site reaction. Pregnancy test prior to use in patients who can become pregnant.\n【185】 The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B screening and management provisional clinical opinion (ASCO [Hwang 2020]) recommends hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.\n【186】 Mechanism of Action\n【187】 Azacitidine (a hypomethylating agent) is a pyrimidine nucleoside analog of cytidine that inhibits DNA/RNA methyltransferases; it is incorporated into DNA and RNA and inhibits DNA and RNA methyltransferases, reduces DNA and RNA methylation, alters DNA gene expression (including re-expression of genes that regulate tumor suppression and cell differentiation), and decreases RNA stability and decreases protein synthesis.\n【188】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【189】 Absorption: SUBQ: Rapid and complete.\n【190】 Distribution: Vd: IV: 76 ± 26 L; does not cross blood-brain barrier; Oral: Vz/F: 881 L.\n【191】 Protein binding: Oral: 6% to 12%.\n【192】 Metabolism: Hepatic; spontaneous hydrolysis and deamination (mediated by cytidine deaminase) to several metabolites.\n【193】 Bioavailability: SUBQ: ~89%; Oral: ~11% (compared to SUBQ).\n【194】 Half-life elimination:\n【195】 Infants and children <7 years: IV: Geometric mean: 0.3 hours (azacytidine) (Niemeyer 2021).\n【196】 Adults: IV, SUBQ: 41 ± 8 minutes (azacitidine); ~4 hours (azacitidine and metabolites); ~4 hours; Oral: ~0.5 hours (azacitidine).\n【197】 Time to peak, plasma: SUBQ: 30 minutes; Oral: 1 hour.\n【198】 Excretion: IV, SUBQ: Urine (50% to 85%); feces (<1%); Oral: Urine (<2% as unchanged drug).\n【199】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【200】 Altered kidney function: The AUC was increased by ~70% after a single SUBQ dose and by 41% after multiple SUBQ doses in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl <30 mL/minute) compared to patients with normal renal function. This increase in exposure did not correlate with increased adverse effects.\n【201】 Brand Names: International\n【202】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Azacitidine  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/azacitidine-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E5%9D%8F%E6%AD%BB%E6%80%A7%E7%AD%8B%E8%86%9C%E7%82%8E&source=search_result&selectedTitle=136%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 19:45:22"}

Consult drug interactions database for more information.\n【39】 Warnings/Precautions\n【40】 Flushing: May cause mild to moderate flushing (eg, warmth, redness, itching, burning sensation); flushing generally appears soon after initiation, and improves or resolves with subsequent dosing. Administration of aspirin (nonenteric coated ≤325 mg) 30 minutes prior to monomethyl fumarate or a temporary dose reduction may also reduce the incidence and severity of flushing.\n【41】 Hepatotoxicity: Clinically significant postmarketing cases of hepatic injury have been reported with the prodrug dimethyl fumarate, with an onset ranging from a few days to several months after treatment initiation. Signs/symptoms of hepatic injury, including transaminase elevations >5 times the ULN and total bilirubin elevations >2 times ULN have been observed. Some cases have required hospitalization; however, none of the cases were fatal or resulted in liver failure or transplant. LFT abnormalities resolved upon discontinuation. Drug-induced hepatocellular injury resulting in new-onset transaminase elevations combined with increased bilirubin levels is an important predictor of serious hepatic injury that may lead to acute hepatic failure, liver transplant, or death in some patients. Transaminase elevations (usually <3 times ULN) were observed in clinical trials with dimethyl fumarate; transaminase elevations ≥3 times ULN occurred rarely. Monitor LFTs prior to treatment initiation and during treatment. Discontinue treatment if monomethyl fumarate-induced hepatic injury is suspected.\n【42】 Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylaxis and angioedema may occur after the first dose or at any time during treatment. Discontinue therapy if signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis or angioedema occur.\n【43】 Infections: Serious cases of herpes zoster (eg, disseminated, ophthalmicus, meningoencephalitis, meningomyelitis) have been reported with the prodrug dimethyl fumarate; may develop any time during treatment. Other serious opportunistic infections have occurred, including viral (eg, Cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex, West Nile), fungal (eg, Aspergillus, Candida), and bacterial (eg, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Nocardia), in patients with and without lymphopenia. Consider temporary interruption of therapy until infection has resolved. In high-risk populations or in countries with high tuberculosis burden, screen for latent infections (eg, hepatitis, tuberculosis) prior to initiating therapy. For patients who screen positive for latent infections, consult infectious disease or other specialists (eg, liver specialists) regarding treatment options before initiating therapy (AAN [Farez 2019]).\n【44】 Lymphopenia: Decreased lymphocyte counts may occur. The risk for lymphopenia is not reduced over time with dimethyl fumarate, the prodrug of monomethyl fumarate. A decline in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) typically occurs in the first year of treatment and stabilizes. Obtain a CBC including lymphocyte count prior to initiation of therapy, then 6 months after initiation, then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, or as clinically indicated. Monitor for signs of infection in patients with lower lymphocyte counts at baseline and mild to moderate lymphopenia (Baharnoori 2018). Consider therapy interruption in patients with lymphocyte counts <500/mm3 persisting >6 months and in patients with serious infections. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) may occur in patients with a lymphocyte count <500/mm3 for <6 months (Lehmann-Horn 2016). Due to a potential for delayed lymphocyte recovery following treatment interruption or discontinuation, monitor lymphocyte counts until lymphopenia is resolved. The decision to restart monomethyl fumarate should be individualized based on clinical circumstances. Neither monomethyl fumarate nor dimethyl fumarate have been studied in patients with preexisting low lymphocyte counts.\n【45】 Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Cases of PML due to the John Cunningham (JC) virus, including fatality, have been reported with the prodrug dimethyl fumarate. Risk factors for development of PML include HIV, AIDS, cancer history, persistent leukocytopenia, sarcoidosis, and prior immunosuppressant use (Jamilloux 2014; Tan 2010). However, cases have been reported with dimethyl fumarate use in patients who were not immunocompromised and had no prior exposure to immunosuppressive drugs, including natalizumab. Severe, long-standing lymphopenia was identified as a primary risk for PML, and the majority of PML cases occurred in patients with lymphocyte counts <800/mm3 persisting for >6 months (although the exact role of lymphopenia in PML is unknown). At the first sign or symptom suggestive of PML, withhold therapy immediately and perform a diagnostic evaluation; symptoms progress over days to weeks and may include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of limbs, vision disturbances, and mental status changes. Cases of PML have been diagnosed based on MRI findings and the detection of JC virus DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid without specific PML signs/symptoms. Monitoring with brain MRI for signs that may be consistent with PML may be beneficial and allow for an early diagnosis of PML (EMA 2015).\n【46】 Immunizations: Avoid live-attenuated vaccines in patients who currently receive or have recently discontinued monomethyl fumarate; consider using live-attenuated vaccines only if risk of infection is high and killed vaccines are unavailable (AAN [Farez 2019]).\n【47】 Dosage Forms: US\n【48】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【49】 Capsule Delayed Release, Oral, as fumarate:\n【50】 Bafiertam: 95 mg [contains cremophor rh40]\n【51】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【52】 No\n【53】 Pricing: US\n【54】 95 mg (per each): $63.23\n【55】 Administration: Adult\n【56】 Oral: Swallow capsules whole and intact; do not crush, chew, or mix the contents with food.

Administration of non–enteric-coated aspirin up to a dose of 325 mg 30 minutes prior to monomethyl fumarate may reduce the incidence of flushing.\n【57】 Use: Labeled Indications\n【58】 Medication Safety Issues\n【59】 Sound-alike/look-alike issues:\n【60】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【61】 None known.\n【62】 Drug Interactions\n【63】 Dimethyl Fumarate: Monomethyl Fumarate may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Dimethyl Fumarate.  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【64】 Diroximel Fumarate: Monomethyl Fumarate may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Diroximel Fumarate.  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【65】 Reproductive Considerations\n【66】 In general, disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) are stopped prior to a planned pregnancy except in females at high risk of MS activity (AAN [Rae-Grant 2018]). Consider use of agents other than monomethylfumarate for females at high risk of disease reactivation who are planning a pregnancy. Delaying pregnancy is recommended for females with persistent high disease activity; when disease-modifying therapy is needed in these patients, other agents are preferred (ECTRIMS/EAN [Montalban 2018]).\n【67】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【68】 In general, disease-modifying therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) are not initiated during pregnancy, except in females at high risk of MS activity (AAN [Rae-Grant 2018]). When disease-modifying therapy is needed in these patients, other agents are preferred (ECTRIMS/ EAN [Montalban 2018]).\n【69】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【70】 It is not known if monomethyl fumarate is present in breast milk.\n【71】 According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and the benefits of treatment to the mother. Based on the low molecular weight and low protein binding, transfer of monomethyl fumarate into breast milk is expected. Until additional information is available, other sources do not recommend breastfeeding during therapy (Almas 2016; Dobson 2019).\n【72】 Monitoring Parameters\n【73】 CBC including lymphocyte counts (prior to initiation of therapy, 6 months after initiation, then every 6 to 12 months thereafter as clinically necessary); LFTs including transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin (prior to treatment initiation and during treatment as clinically indicated); MRI (baseline and as clinically indicated to monitor for early signs of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy); latent infection screening (eg, hepatitis, tuberculosis) in high-risk populations or in countries with high tuberculosis burden (baseline).\n【74】 Mechanism of Action\n【75】 Monomethyl fumarate (MMF) and its prodrug, dimethyl fumarate, have been shown to activate the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) pathway, which is involved in cellular response to oxidative stress. The mechanism by which monomethyl fumarate exerts a therapeutic effect in multiple sclerosis is unknown, although it is believed to result from its anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective properties via activation of the Nrf2 pathway (Fox 2012; Gold 2012). MMF has also been identified as a nicotinic acid receptor agonist in vitro.\n【76】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【77】 Absorption: High-fat, high-calorie meals prolong absorption and decrease Cmax by 20%.\n【78】 Distribution: Vd ­(prodrug dimethyl fumarate): 53 to 73 L.\n【79】 Protein binding: Prodrug dimethyl fumarate: 27% to 45%.\n【80】 Metabolism: Through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with no involvement of the CYP-450 system.\n【81】 Half-life elimination: ~0.5 hour.\n【82】 Time to peak: 4.03 hours; after high-fat meal: 11 hours.\n【83】 Excretion: From studies with dimethyl fumarate: Exhalation of CO2: ~60% of dimethyl fumarate; urine (16% of dimethyl fumarate; trace amounts as unchanged monomethyl fumarate); feces (1% of dimethyl fumarate).\n【84】 Brand Names: International\n【85】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Monomethyl Fumarate  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/monomethyl-fumarate-drug-information?search=%E7%BB%93%E6%A0%B8%E6%80%A7%E8%84%91%E8%86%9C%E8%84%91%E7%82%8E&source=search_result&selectedTitle=51%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:47:29"}

In one study of IV metronidazole, adult patients with alcoholic liver disease (with or without cirrhosis) demonstrated a prolonged elimination half-life (eg, ~18 hours). The authors recommended the dose be reduced accordingly (clearance was reduced by ~62%) and the frequency may be prolonged (eg, every 12 hours instead of every 6 hours) (Ref). In another single IV dose study using metronidazole metabolism to predict hepatic function, patients classified as Child-Pugh class C demonstrated a half-life of ~21.5 hours (Ref).\n【63】 Adverse Reactions (Significant): Considerations\n【64】 Disulfiram-like reaction\n【65】 Adverse Reactions\n【66】 The following adverse drug reactions and incidences are derived from product labeling unless otherwise specified.\n【67】 >10%:\n【68】 Gastrointestinal: Nausea (10% to 12%)\n【69】 Genitourinary: Vaginitis (15%)\n【70】 Nervous system: Headache (18%)\n【71】 1% to 10%:\n【72】 Gastrointestinal: Abdominal pain (4%), diarrhea (4%), metallic taste (9%), xerostomia (2%)\n【73】 Genitourinary: Dysmenorrhea (3%), genital pruritus (5%), urinary tract infection (2%), urine abnormality (3%)\n【74】 Infection: Bacterial infection (7%), candidiasis (3%)\n【75】 Nervous system: Dizziness (4%)\n【76】 Respiratory: Flu-like symptoms (6%), pharyngitis (3%), rhinitis (4%), sinusitis (3%), upper respiratory tract infection (4%)\n【77】 Frequency not defined:\n【78】 Cardiovascular: Chest pain, flattened T-wave on ECG, flushing, palpitations, peripheral edema, syncope, tachycardia\n【79】 Dermatologic: Erythematous rash, hyperhidrosis, pruritus, urticaria\n【80】 Endocrine & metabolic: Decreased libido\n【81】 Gastrointestinal: Abdominal cramps, anorexia, constipation, decreased appetite, dysgeusia, epigastric discomfort, glossitis, hairy tongue, proctitis, stomatitis, vomiting\n【82】 Genitourinary: Cystitis, dyspareunia, dysuria, urinary incontinence, vaginal dryness, vulvovaginal candidiasis\n【83】 Hematologic & oncologic: Agranulocytosis, eosinophilia\n【84】 Hypersensitivity: Facial edema\n【85】 Local: Inflammation at injection site, injection-site reaction\n【86】 Nervous system: Asthenia, chills, depression, drowsiness, hypoesthesia, insomnia, irritability, malaise, numbness, psychosis\n【87】 Neuromuscular & skeletal: Arthralgia, muscle spasm, myalgia\n【88】 Ophthalmic: Abnormal eye movements (saccadic), nystagmus disorder\n【89】 Renal: Polyuria\n【90】 Respiratory: Dyspnea, nasal congestion\n【91】 Miscellaneous: Fever\n【92】 Postmarketing:\n【93】 Cardiovascular: Prolonged QT interval on ECG (Gnanapandithan 2021; Mojadidi 2016)\n【94】 Dermatologic: Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, bullous dermatitis, fixed drug eruption, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (Mazumdar 2014), toxic epidermal necrolysis (Ali 2021)\n【95】 Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis (O’Halloran 2010; Yilmaz 2016; Youssef 2019)\n【96】 Genitourinary: Urine discoloration (Anjum 2022)\n【97】 Hematologic & oncologic: Leukopenia (Taylor 1965), neutropenia (Khan 2008), thrombocytopenia (Lew 2017)\n【98】 Hepatic: Acute hepatic failure (especially in Cockayne syndrome) (Ataee 2020), hepatotoxicity (including severe hepatotoxicity, especially in Cockayne syndrome) (Hestin 1994)\n【99】 Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis (Asensio Sánchez 2008), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, serum sickness-like reaction (joint pains) (VanCleave 2016)\n【100】 Nervous system: Aseptic meningitis (Khan 2007), ataxia (Sagvekar 2019), confusion (Kuriyama 2011), dysarthria (Boot 2017), encephalopathy (Roy 2016), mania (Puri 2021), neurocerebellar toxicity (Patel 2008), paresthesia (Soh 2021), peripheral neuropathy (Goolsby 2018), seizure (Huang 2012), vertigo (Chen 2013)\n【101】 Ophthalmic: Optic neuropathy (Chen 2013)\n【102】 Miscellaneous: Disulfiram-like reaction (with alcohol) (Alonzo 2019)\n【103】 Contraindications\n【104】 Hypersensitivity to metronidazole, nitroimidazole derivatives, or any component of the formulation; during the first trimester of pregnancy in patients with trichomoniasis; use of disulfiram within the past 2 weeks; use of alcohol or propylene glycol-containing products during therapy or within 3 days of therapy discontinuation; Cockayne syndrome.\n【105】 Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance.

Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【185】 Food Interactions\n【186】 Peak antibiotic serum concentration lowered and delayed, but total drug absorbed not affected.\n【187】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【188】 Metronidazole crosses the placenta.\n【189】 Cleft lip with or without cleft palate has been reported following first trimester exposure to metronidazole; however, most studies have not shown an increased risk of congenital anomalies or other adverse events to the fetus following maternal use during pregnancy. Because metronidazole was carcinogenic in some animal species, concern has been raised whether metronidazole should be used during pregnancy. Available studies have not shown an increased risk of infant cancer following metronidazole exposure during pregnancy; however, the ability to detect a signal for this may have been limited.\n【190】 Metronidazole pharmacokinetics are similar between pregnant and nonpregnant patients (Amon 1981; Visser 1984; Wang 2011).\n【191】 Bacterial vaginosis and vaginal trichomoniasis are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes (such as premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery). The CDC recommends treatment of pregnant patients with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis; the twice daily dose of oral metronidazole for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis is the same for nonpregnant and pregnant patients; however, a three times daily regimen has also been used. Treatment of pregnant patients with asymptomatic bacterial vaginitis who are at high risk for preterm delivery has had mixed results. Metronidazole is also recommended for the treatment of vaginal trichomoniasis in pregnant patients. Although use of oral metronidazole for vaginal trichomoniasis during the first trimester is contraindicated by the manufacturer, available guidelines note treatment can be given at any stage of pregnancy (CDC [Workowski 2021]).\n【192】 Metronidazole may also be used for the treatment of giardiasis in pregnant patients (some sources recommend second and third trimester administration only) (Gardner 2001; HHS [OI adult 2020]) and symptomatic amebiasis during pregnancy (HHS [OI adult 2020]; Li 1996). Short courses may be used for the treatment of pouchitis or perianal disease in pregnant patients with inflammatory bowel disease; not recommended for planned maintenance therapy (Mahadevan 2019). The use of other agents is preferred when treatment is needed for Clostridioides\n【193】 difficile during pregnancy (ACG [Kelly 2021]). Consult current recommendations for appropriate use in pregnant patients.\n【194】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【195】 Metronidazole and its active hydroxyl metabolite are present in breast milk at concentrations similar to maternal plasma concentrations. Metronidazole and its active metabolite can be detected in the serum of breastfeeding infants (Gray 1961; Heisterberg 1983; Passmore 1988).\n【196】 Information related to the presence of metronidazole in breast milk is available from multiple studies:\n【197】 Metronidazole transfer to breast milk was assessed in 3 women 6, 13, and 14 weeks' postpartum. Metronidazole 2 g was given orally as a single dose. Breastfeeding was withheld for 24 hours after the dose and several milk samples were collected during these 24 hours. The highest average milk concentrations occurred 2 to 4 hours after the dose; the highest reported average milk concentration was 45.8 mcg/mL. Average milk concentrations were ~12.6 mcg/mL 12 to 24 hours after the dose. The half-life of metronidazole in breast milk was ~9 to 10 hours (2 patients). The authors estimated the infant dose received via breast milk to be 21.8 mg in the first 24 hours and an additional 3.5 mg in the second day after the dose. They noted that withholding breastfeeding for 12 to 24 hours would significantly decrease metronidazole exposure to the breastfeeding infant (Erickson 1981). Metabolite concentrations were not measured in this study. The relative infant dose (RID) of metronidazole is 13.7% to 22.9% when calculated using the highest average breast milk concentration reported in the study (45.8 mcg/mL), compared to an oral infant therapeutic dose of 30 to 50 mg/kg/day, providing an estimated daily infant dose via breast milk of 6.87 mg/kg/day.\n【198】 A review article used information from 4 published studies to calculate an RID for metronidazole and compare it to other antibiotics. Maternal doses of oral metronidazole used in these studies ranged from 200 to 400 mg 3 times daily (Heisterberg 1983; Passmore 1988; Willis 1978) or a 2 g single oral dose (Erickson 1981). Authors of the review calculated the RID of metronidazole to be 11%, providing a median estimated daily infant dose via breast milk of 1.59 mg/kg/day (van Wattum 2019).\n【199】 In general, breastfeeding is considered acceptable when the RID is <10%; when an RID is >25%, breastfeeding should generally be avoided (Anderson 2016; Ito 2000).\n【200】 Breast milk was also evaluated following administration of metronidazole 500 mg IV 3 times a day for 2 days to patients following cesarean delivery. Sampling occurred 1 to 2 hours after the dose on the second day of therapy. Metronidazole concentrations were 7.3 to 10.1 mcg/mL (breast milk) and 7.7 to 13.1 mcg/mL (maternal plasma) (Geballa-Koukoula 2018).\n【201】 Loose stools, oral and perianal Candida growth, and oral thrush have been reported in breastfeeding infants exposed to metronidazole (Passmore 1988).\n【202】 The manufacturer warns of the risk of carcinogenicity in patients exposed to metronidazole based on animal studies; theoretically, this risk is also present in breastfeeding infants exposed to metronidazole via breast milk. Therefore, the manufacturer recommends a decision be made whether to discontinue breastfeeding or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of treatment to the mother.\n【203】 Some guidelines note if metronidazole is given, breastfeeding should be withheld for 12 to 24 hours after a single 2 g dose (CDC [Workowski 2021]; WHO 2002); alternatively, the mother may pump and discard breast milk for 24 hours after taking the last metronidazole dose. Use of lower maternal doses may provide lower concentrations of metronidazole in breast milk and use can be considered in patients who are breastfeeding (CDC [Workowski 2021]). Use of other agents is preferred when treating breastfeeding patients for diseases such as Clostridioides\n【204】 difficile infection, or pouchitis or perianal disease in lactating patients with inflammatory bowel disease (ACG [Kelly 2021]).\n【205】 Dietary Considerations\n【206】 Take with food to minimize stomach upset.\n【207】 Sodium: Injectable dosage form may contain sodium.\n【208】 Ethanol: According to the manufacturer’s labeling, use of ethanol is contraindicated during therapy and for 3 days after therapy discontinuation; however, the CDC sexually transmitted infection guidelines state refraining from alcohol use while taking metronidazole is not necessary (CDC [Workowski 2021]). Clinical data demonstrating an association between concomitant use with alcohol and a disulfiram-like reaction are conflicting (Mergenhagen 2020).\n【209】 Monitoring Parameters\n【210】 Monitor CBC with differential at baseline, during, and after prolonged or repeated courses of therapy. Closely monitor elderly patients and patients with severe hepatic impairment or ESRD for adverse reactions. Neurologic symptoms; observe patients carefully if neurologic symptoms occur and consider discontinuation of therapy.\n【211】 Mechanism of Action\n【212】 After diffusing into the organism, interacts with DNA to cause a loss of helical DNA structure and strand breakage resulting in inhibition of protein synthesis and cell death in susceptible organisms\n【213】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【214】 Absorption: Oral: Well absorbed.\n【215】 Distribution: To bile, seminal fluid, bone, liver, and liver abscesses, lung and vaginal secretions; crosses blood-brain barrier; saliva and CSF concentrations similar to those in plasma.\n【216】 Vd: Preterm neonates (PMA: 24 to 39 weeks): Median: 0.95 L/kg (range: 0.75 to 1.03 L/kg) (Cohen-Wolkowiez 2013).\n【217】 Protein binding: <20%.\n【218】 Metabolism: Hepatic (30% to 60%) to several metabolites including an active hydroxyl metabolite which maintains activity ~30% to 65% of the parent compound (Lamp 1999).\n【219】 Half-life elimination:\n【220】 Neonates <7 days (Jager-Roman 1982): Within first week of life, more prolonged with lower GA:\n【221】 GA 28 to 30 weeks: 75.3 ± 16.9 hours.\n【222】 GA 32 to 35 weeks: 35.4 ± 1.5 hours.\n【223】 GA 36 to 40 weeks: 24.8 ± 1.6 hours.\n【224】 Neonates ≥7 days: ~22.5 hours (Upadhyaya 1988).\n【225】 Children and Adolescents: 6 to 10 hours (Lamp 1999).\n【226】 Adults: ~8 hours.\n【227】 Time to peak, serum: Oral: 1 to 2 hours.\n【228】 Excretion: Urine (unchanged drug and metabolites: 60% to 80%; ~20% of total as unchanged drug); feces (6% to 15%).\n【229】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【230】 According to Child-Pugh classification (Muscara 1995):\n【231】 Child-Pugh class A: ~10.7 hours.\n【232】 Child-Pugh class B: ~13.5 hours.\n【233】 Child-Pugh class C: ~21.5 hours.\n【234】 Organism specific: B. fragilis: Goal: AUC/MIC ≥70 (Sprandel 2006).\n【235】 Neonates and Infants <8 weeks PNA: IV: 20 mg/kg: 17.7 ± 3.1 mg/L (Rubenson 1986).\n【236】 Infants 3 to 10 months of age: IV: 20 mg/kg: 25.3 ± 4.5 mg/L (Rubenson 1986).\n【237】 Children ≥4 years of age and Adolescents ≤17 years of age: IV: 30 mg/kg (maximum dose: Weight <80 kg: 1,000 mg; Weight >80 kg: 1,500 mg): ~50 mg/L (Child 2019).\n【238】 Adults: Oral:\n【239】 250 mg: 6 mg/L (manufacturer's labeling).\n【240】 500 mg: ~8 to 12 mg/L (Lamp 1999; manufacturer's labeling).\n【241】 2 g: 40 mg/L (manufacturer’s labeling).\n【242】 Preterm Neonates (GA ≤32 weeks; PNA ≤90 days): IV: 15 mg/kg loading dose followed by 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours (PNA <14 days) or 24 hours (PNA ≥14 days): 24.6 mg/L (Cohen-Wolkowiez 2013).\n【243】 Adults: IV:\n【244】 500 mg every 8 hours: 22.2 ± 5 mg/L (Sprandel 2004).\n【245】 1 g once daily: 24.8 ± 6.8 mg/L (Sprandel 2004).\n【246】 1.5 g once daily: 37.7 ± 10 mg/L (Sprandel 2004).\n【247】 15 mg/kg loading dose; 7.5 mg/kg every 6 hours: 25 mg/L (manufacturer’s labeling).\n【248】 Children ≥4 years of age and Adolescents ≤17 years of age (Child 2019): IV: 30 mg/kg (maximum dose: Weight <80 kg: 1,000 mg; Weight >80 kg: 1,500 mg):\n【249】 4 to 5 years of age: 612 to 732 mghour/L.\n【250】 6 to 9 years of age: 520 to 588 mghour/L.\n【251】 10 to 12 years of age: 419 to 478 mghour/L.\n【252】 13 to 17 years of age: 313 to 369 mghour/L.\n【253】 500 mg every 8 hours: 356 ± 68 mghour/L (Sprandel 2004).\n【254】 1 g once daily: 227 ± 57 mghour/L (Sprandel 2004).\n【255】 1.5 g once daily: 338 ± 105 mghour/L (Sprandel 2004).\n【256】 Brand Names: International\n【257】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Metronidazole (systemic)  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/metronidazole-systemic-drug-information?search=%E5%8F%98%E5%BA%94%E6%80%A7%E9%BE%88%E7%82%8E&source=search_result&selectedTitle=145%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:13:38"}

Appropriate medications should not be withheld due to concerns of fetal teratogenicity. Norepinephrine use during the post-resuscitation phase may be considered; however, the effects of vasoactive medications on the fetus should also be considered. Doses and indications should follow current Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support guidelines (Jeejeebhoy [AHA] 2015).\n【113】 Monitoring Parameters\n【114】 Blood pressure (or mean arterial pressure), heart rate, cardiac output (as appropriate), intravascular volume status, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (as appropriate); urine output, peripheral perfusion; monitor infusion site closely.\n【115】 Consult individual institutional policies and procedures.\n【116】 Mechanism of Action\n【117】 Stimulates beta1-adrenergic receptors and alpha-adrenergic receptors causing increased contractility and heart rate as well as vasoconstriction, thereby increasing systemic blood pressure and coronary blood flow; clinically, alpha effects (vasoconstriction) are greater than beta effects (inotropic and chronotropic effects)\n【118】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【119】 Onset of action: Very rapid acting.\n【120】 Duration: Vasopressor: 1 to 2 minutes.\n【121】 Distribution: Vd: 8.8 L.\n【122】 Protein binding: 25% mainly albumin with smaller extent to prealbumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein.\n【123】 Metabolism: Via catechol-o-methyltransferase and monoamine oxidase.\n【124】 Half-life elimination: Mean: ~2.4 minutes.\n【125】 Time to peak, serum: Steady state: 5 minutes.\n【126】 Excretion: Urine (as inactive metabolites; small amounts as unchanged drug).\n【127】 Brand Names: International\n【128】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Norepinephrine (noradrenaline)  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/norepinephrine-noradrenaline-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E5%8F%97%E6%AF%8D%E4%BD%93%E9%AB%98%E8%A1%80%E5%8E%8B%E7%96%BE%E6%82%A3%E5%BD%B1%E5%93%8D%E7%9A%84%E8%83%8E%E5%84%BF%E6%88%96%E6%96%B0%E7%94%9F%E5%84%BF&source=search_result&selectedTitle=113%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:08:30"}

However, because of similarities in chemical structure and/or pharmacologic actions, the possibility of cross-sensitivity cannot be ruled out with certainty.\n【31】 Warnings/Precautions\n【32】 Adrenal suppression: May cause hypercortisolism or suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in younger children or in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis.\n【33】 Contact dermatitis: Allergic contact dermatitis can occur and is usually diagnosed by failure to heal rather than clinical exacerbation; discontinue use if irritation occurs and treat appropriately.\n【34】 Immunosuppression: Prolonged use may result in fungal or bacterial superinfection; discontinue if dermatological infection persists despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy.\n【35】 Ocular effects: Topical corticosteroids, including mometasone, may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Monitor for ocular changes. Avoid contact with eyes.\n【36】 Systemic effects: Topical corticosteroids may be absorbed percutaneously. Absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, or glycosuria. Absorption is increased by the use of occlusive dressings, application to denuded skin, or application to large surface areas.\n【37】 Older adult: Because of the risk of adverse effects associated with systemic absorption, topical corticosteroids should be used cautiously in the elderly in the smallest possible effective dose for the shortest duration.\n【38】 Pediatric: Not for treatment of diaper dermatitis. Children may absorb proportionally larger amounts after topical application and may be more prone to systemic effects. HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, and Cushing syndrome have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Prolonged use may affect growth velocity; growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.\n【39】 Appropriate use: Avoid use of topical preparations with occlusive dressings or on weeping or exudative lesions.\n【40】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【41】 The extent of percutaneous absorption is dependent on several factors, including epidermal integrity (intact vs abraded skin), formulation, age of the patient, prolonged duration of use, and the use of occlusive dressings. Percutaneous absorption of topical steroids is increased in neonates (especially preterm neonates), infants, and young children. Infants and small children may be more susceptible to HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, Cushing syndrome, or other systemic toxicities due to larger skin surface area to body mass ratio.\n【42】 Open-label safety studies conducted in infants and children 6 to 23 months of age with atopic dermatitis demonstrated a high incidence of adrenal suppression when topical mometasone furoate products were applied once daily for approximately 3 weeks over a mean BSA of ~40%. Of the patients with normal baseline adrenal function, adrenal suppression occurred in 16% of patients using the cream, 27% of patients using the ointment, and 29% of patients using the lotion/solution. Follow-up testing 2 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of therapy demonstrated suppressed HPA axis function in 1 of 5 patients who used the cream, 3 of 8 patients who used the ointment, and 1 of 8 patients who used the lotion/solution. Due to a higher BSA to weight ratio, pediatric patients are at a greater risk of HPA axis suppression and Cushing syndrome compared to adults. Application of topical steroids over >20% of BSA in pediatric patients increases risk of HPA axis suppression.\n【43】 Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; in neonates large amounts of propylene glycol delivered orally, intravenously (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically have been associated with potentially fatal toxicities which can include metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, and CNS depression; toxicities have also been reported in children and adults including hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Shehab 2009).\n【44】 Dosage Forms: US\n【45】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【81】 Reproductive Considerations\n【82】 Topical corticosteroids may be used for the treatment of corticosteroid-responsive dermatosis, such as atopic dermatitis, in patients planning a pregnancy (Vestergaard 2019).\n【83】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【84】 Systemic bioavailability of topical corticosteroids is variable (integrity of skin, use of occlusion, etc) and may be further influenced by trimester of pregnancy (Chi 2017). In general, the use of topical corticosteroids is not associated with a significant risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes; however, there may be an increased risk of low-birth-weight infants following maternal use of potent or very potent topical products, especially in high doses, although this risk is likely to be low (Andersson 2021; Chi 2015; Chi 2017).\n【85】 When first-line treatments, such as emollients, are insufficient, topical corticosteroids may be used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in pregnant patients (Vestergaard 2019). Topical corticosteroids are classified by potency; the medication and formulation (eg, cream, gel, salt form) contribute to the potency classification (Oakley 2021; Stacey 2021; Tadicherla 2009). In general, use of the least potent product in limited amounts is recommended during pregnancy. Mild to moderate potency corticosteroids are preferred; potent to very potent topical corticosteroids should only be used as alternative therapy in limited amounts under obstetrical care. Pregnant patients should avoid application of topical corticosteroids to areas with high percutaneous absorption (eg, armpit, skin folds, vulva) (Chi 2017), and caution should be used when applying to areas prone to striae formation (eg, abdomen, breast, thighs) (Vestergaard 2019).\n【86】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【87】 It is not known if sufficient quantities of mometasone are absorbed following topical administration to produce detectable amounts in breast milk; however, systemic corticosteroids are present in breast milk.\n【88】 Although the manufacturer recommends that caution be used, topical corticosteroids are generally considered acceptable for use in patients who are breastfeeding (Butler 2014; WHO 2002).\n【89】 Avoid application of topical corticosteroids to the nipple and areola area until breastfeeding ceases; hypertension was noted in a breastfed infant when a high-potency topical corticosteroid was applied to the nipple (AAD-NPF [Elmets 2021]; Butler 2014; Leachman 2006). If needed, apply topical corticosteroids immediately after breastfeeding and then clean nipples prior to the next feeding (Vestergaard 2019).\n【90】 Monitoring Parameters\n【91】 Adrenal suppression with extensive/prolonged use (ACTH stimulation test, morning plasma cortisol test, urinary free cortisol test); response to treatment; ocular changes\n【92】 Mechanism of Action\n【93】 Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. May depress the formation, release, and activity of endogenous chemical mediators of inflammation (kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins) through the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins) and sequential inhibition of the release of arachidonic acid. Mometasone has intermediate range potency.\n【94】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【95】 Absorption: Cream: 0.4% (increased by inflammation); Lotion, ointment, solution: 0.7% (increased by inflammation)\n【96】 Brand Names: International\n【97】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Mometasone (topical)  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/mometasone-topical-drug-information?search=%E4%BA%8C%E6%9C%9F%E7%9A%AE%E8%82%A4%E6%88%96%E9%BB%8F%E8%86%9C%E6%A2%85%E6%AF%92&source=search_result&selectedTitle=128%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:49:02"}

Incomplete bladder emptying is most commonly described and measured as the volume of urine left in the bladder after voiding, also known as the postvoid residual. The two common causes of CUR are bladder muscle dysfunction (detrusor underactivity) and obstruction. CUR is generally a gradual process.\n【2】 This topic will review the etiology, evaluation, and treatment options for females with CUR. Issues of acute urinary retention and postoperative urinary retention are discussed separately.\n【3】 In this topic, when discussing study results, we will use the terms \"woman/en\" or \"patient(s)\" as they are used in the studies presented. However, we encourage the reader to consider the specific counseling and treatment needs of transgender and gender diverse individuals.\n【4】 DEFINITION — Clinically relevant CUR is the accumulation of urine that results in adverse clinical outcome in the absence of intervention . CUR is typically determined by measuring a postvoid residual urine volume (PVR). PVR is defined by the International Continence Society as the volume of urine left in the bladder at the completion of micturition . The American Urological Association (AUA) Quality Improvement and Patient Safety committee defined CUR as \"an elevated postvoid residual (PVR) of >300 mL that has persisted for at least six months documented on two or more separate occasions\" . However, the authors acknowledge that no single PVR value defines CUR in all individuals. Further, the AUA definition of CUR relates specifically to their proposed treatment algorithm, and the term CUR will be used in this article to more broadly encompass incomplete bladder emptying. The AUA work group defined high-risk CUR as people who are at increased risk for potential organ damage including renal failure, pyelonephritis, or urosepsis.  'Diagnosis' below.)\n【5】 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY — Normal voiding requires coordinated urethral and pelvic floor muscle relaxation followed by bladder contraction ; any disruption to these actions can result in urinary retention. The voiding reflex is triggered in the pontine micturition center and leads to relaxation of the external striated urethral sphincter (via sympathetic innervation from the hypogastric nerve) and pelvic floor muscles (via somatic innervation by the pudendal nerve)  . The resultant drop in urethral pressure is followed by contraction of the bladder detrusor muscle, which is mediated by parasympathetic innervation from the pelvic plexus. Incomplete emptying can result from abnormal function anywhere along the above pathway or when there is obstruction at the outlet level.\n【6】 EPIDEMIOLOGY\n【7】 Prevalence — As the diagnosis of CUR requires testing such as postvoid residual (PVR) or urodynamic assessment, prevalence estimates come from the subpopulation of women referred for specialty evaluation. Estimates of CUR in women from the general population are difficult to obtain because symptoms of incomplete emptying and obstructed flow do not reliably predict CUR in women . In studies that reported PVR in women presenting with a variety of lower urinary tract symptoms, 8 to 9 percent of patients were found to have PVR of ≥100 mL and up to 5 percent had PVR ≥150 mL .  'Diagnosis' below.)\n【8】 Risk factors — Risk factors for reduced or absent bladder contraction (ie, detrusor underactivity and detrusor acontractility) and resultant CUR include the normal aging process, neurogenic diseases such as Parkinson disease and multiple sclerosis, myogenic diseases, and iatrogenic interventions such as pelvic surgery or radiation . Risk factors for obstructive causes of CUR include conditions that cause mass effect or urethral kinking, such as a urethral mass, prior incontinence surgery, or pelvic organ prolapse. These are discussed in detail below.  'Detrusor underactivity' below and 'Obstruction' below.)\n【9】 CAUSES OF URINARY RETENTION — CUR may be caused by impaired detrusor activity, bladder outlet obstruction, or both .\n【10】 Detrusor underactivity — The International Continence Society defines detrusor underactivity (DU) as a \"contraction of reduced strength and/or duration, resulting in prolonged bladder emptying and/or a failure to achieve complete bladder emptying within a normal time span\" . DU represents an inability of the bladder to generate adequate contraction strength and is likely multifactorial . The diagnosis is primarily made by urodynamic testing . An extreme form of DU, acontractile detrusor, is the true absence of detrusor contraction during the voiding phase of urodynamic evaluation. Underactive bladder (UAB) is considered to be a symptom of DU; however, clinical presentation is variable, and noninvasive diagnostic criteria are lacking . The International Consultation on Incontinence is developing a UAB outcomes measure; however, it is unknown whether the questionnaire will also be useful as a screening tool .  'Urodynamic evaluation' below.)\n【11】 Of note, a subset of women will have difficulty voiding in the artificial urodynamic environment, and therefore may appear to have urinary retention or obstruction, but otherwise have no signs or symptoms of incomplete bladder emptying. Caution must be made when interpreting the pressure flow data in these patients, and it is important to take symptoms and other measures such as the postvoid residual (PVR) into account when interpreting the urodynamic findings for these women.\n【12】 Detrusor function may be affected by multiple factors, including bladder outlet obstruction, local neuropathy (both sensory and motor innervation), central nervous system disorders, ischemic changes, and bladder wall muscle changes. Thus, common causes of DU include aging, diabetes, neurologic diseases, and medications.\n【13】 Aging — Detrusor contraction strength, urine flow rate, and bladder sensation decline significantly with age . These age-related changes increase the risk of inadequate voiding and can ultimately result in urinary retention. Possible mechanisms of age-related decline in bladder function include decreased smooth muscle:collagen ratio , decreased bladder sensation , and diminished brain response to bladder filling .\n【14】 Although bladder muscle function changes with increasing age, PVR urine volume does not appear to increase with normal aging. An observational study of 85 community-dwelling women reported no difference in the lowest PVR between women 20 to 39 years of age and women ≥60 years (10 mL versus 12 mL, respectively) . Therefore, an elevated PVR cannot be attributed to age alone and clinical evaluation is warranted.\n【15】 Diabetes mellitus — Diabetes is associated with urinary disease, including both voiding and storage disorders . As an example, in a study of 194 women with type 2 diabetes compared with 162 nondiabetic controls, diabetic women were more likely to have a PVR urine volume >100 mL (14 percent versus 2 percent) . A study of urodynamic findings in men and women with diabetes reported that 30 percent of women had impaired detrusor contractility and 13 percent had an acontractile detrusor .\n【16】 The myogenic and neurogenic alterations in diabetes are thought to be the result of prolonged hyperglycemia and production of oxidative stress products . Oxidative stress contributes to peripheral neuropathy and subsequently impairs bladder function. In the studies above, peripheral neuropathy was associated with acontractile detrusor  and decreased bladder emptying . The association of peripheral neuropathy and bladder dysfunction is particularly important because the prevalence of neuropathy is estimated to be approximately 8 percent in newly diagnosed diabetes patients and greater than 50 percent in patients with long-standing disease .   \"Diabetic autonomic neuropathy\", section on 'Genitourinary autonomic neuropathy'.)\n【17】 Neurologic disorders — Lower urinary tract dysfunction and subsequent CUR can result from a wide range of neurologic disorders . The site of the lesion in the neurological axis, such as in spinal cord injury, determines the general pattern of lower urinary tract dysfunction, which is reflected in the patient's symptoms.   \"Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease\", section on 'Urinary complications'.)\n【18】 Progressive neurologic diseases such as multiple sclerosis are associated with DU and resultant CUR. Many (50 to 80 percent) patients with multiple sclerosis report symptoms of urinary retention, urinary incontinence, or both . In a study of 170 symptomatic men and women with MS who underwent urodynamic evaluation, 63 percent of patients had an elevated PVR (≥100 mL), with a mean residual volume of 220 mL . A survey study of over 9600 patients with MS (25 percent men and 75 percent women) reported that one-quarter of respondents required urinary catheterization to treat CUR, including self-catheterization or indwelling catheter . Longer duration of disease and increased physical disability were associated with increased urinary catheter use.\n【19】 Patients with spinal cord injury as a cause of CUR are a population with unique challenges. CUR in individuals with spinal cord injury is reviewed separately.   \"Chronic complications of spinal cord injury and disease\", section on 'Bladder dysfunction'.)\n【20】 In contrast with patients with progressive or permanent neurologic disease, individuals with reversible spinal disorders (eg, disc herniation or compression) can have improvement in their bladder function after correction of the spinal lesion. However, it is not known if the statistically significant reductions in PVR reported after spinal surgery are clinically relevant. As an example, in a study of patients with lumbar spinal cord compression due to either disc herniation or compression, 37 of 113 female subjects (33 percent) had bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms preoperatively . While modest improvements in urinary symptom scores and urodynamic evaluation parameters were seen after decompression, it is unclear if the change in mean PVR from 48 mL to 22 mL is important clinically.\n【21】 Medication — While medication use is a common cause of acute urinary retention, it is unclear how often it contributes to CUR, particularly in women. Drugs commonly associated with acute urinary retention have anticholinergic properties that can potentially affect parasympathetic-mediated detrusor contractility . Such medications include antihistamines, tricyclic antidepressants, antispasmodics, antiparkinsonian medications, antipsychotics, vertigo treatments, bronchodilators, and overactive bladder drugs.\n【22】 Medications can also impair other aspects of voiding function . Selective serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors have been associated with urinary retention; the mechanism appears to be increased resistance at the external sphincter that is mediated by activity at both the local and spinal neurons, though central serotonergic mechanisms may be involved as well. Benzodiazepines and opiates likely impair detrusor contractile ability and cause subsequent CUR. Finally, alpha-adrenergic agonists used for postural hypotension or nasal decongestion may lead to voiding difficulties due to increased tone at the internal urethral sphincter.\n【23】 Obstruction — Bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) is defined by the International Continence Society as a \"generic term for obstruction during voiding\" . Although BOO is one of the most common clinical complaints in adult men , BOO is less common in women . The prevalence data on BOO in women range widely in part because of a lack of uniform definition and also because storage and voiding disorders can coexist . When a urodynamic definition is used to diagnose BOO in women with voiding symptoms, BOO prevalence rates of 3 to 6 percent have been reported , although other studies have reported prevalence rates up to 29 percent . It is important to note that BOO is a urodynamic diagnosis and not always accompanied by CUR or elevated PVR.\n【24】 BOO in women is subdivided by cause into anatomic and functional subgroups.\n【25】 Anatomic — Anatomic BOO represents an increased urethral pressure or resistance that prevents urine passage resulting from urethral distortion, external urethral compression, or intrinsic urethral lesions. Anatomic causes are generally more obvious than functional causes and are often suspected by the patient's history, such as a prior history of anti-incontinence surgery .\n【26】 Urethral distortion — Pelvic organ prolapse may cause lower urinary tract anatomic distortion including urethral kinking, which can then result in impaired urine flow and an elevated PVR . In a study of 636 women evaluated in a female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery clinic, prolapse beyond the hymen independently predicted urinary retention, defined as a PVR >150 mL . In a different study, reduction of the prolapse with a pessary resolved the urinary obstruction in 17 of 18 women with prolapse beyond the hymen .\n【27】 External urethral compression — Any process that compresses the urethra may impair urine flow and result in BOO. Biologic causes include fibroids, constipation, and malignancy. A common iatrogenic cause is a previous suburethral anti-incontinence sling.\n【28】 Fibroids may cause urethral compression by displacing the cervix and subsequently compressing the urethra or bladder neck . An alternate mechanism may be local pressure on the pelvic nerve plexus that causes a radiculopathy at the S1-S2 nerve roots . In a retrospective review of 284 women who underwent myomectomy or hysterectomy, six women (2 percent) presented with acute urinary retention . Of note, the urinary retention resolved in all women postoperatively. Similarly, a case series reported that acute urinary retention resolved in seven of eight women after surgical therapy for fibroids . There does not appear to be a consistent fibroid location that is associated with urinary retention. The majority of the women in the series above had posterior-fundal fibroids, while in another small case series of four women, the fibroids were in the lower uterine segment or cervix for three of the four women .\n【29】 While the treatment of constipation in children has been associated with a decrease in PVR , the role of constipation as a cause of urethral obstruction and resultant CUR in adults is unclear. A study of 44 nursing home patients with fecal impaction reported that 14 percent also had urinary retention . However, bivariate analysis indicated that fecal impaction was associated with immobility and not DU or urinary retention . In contrast, a study of 167 adults in a geriatric rehabilitation unit reported that the prevalence of urinary retention was 11 percent and was significantly associated with fecal impaction . Although fecal impaction may contribute to CUR in certain settings, it is not known if treatment of constipation and fecal impaction will improve CUR in adults.\n【30】 Intrinsic urethral lesions — Urethral lesions such as strictures, urethral diverticula, and caruncles can cause urethral blockage. Urethral strictures are typically caused by previous urethral or periurethral surgery or from previous dilation. Idiopathic urethral strictures can also occur but are less common. Strictures have been diagnosed in 4 to 13 percent of women with BOO, although the etiology of the strictures was not defined in these studies .\n【31】 Urethral diverticulum and Skene's glands infrequently cause outlet obstruction, representing 1 to 3 percent of the cases of outlet obstruction in two large reviews . Urethral cancer is rare and represents 1 percent of all malignancies, but may present with obstructive symptoms .\n【32】 Functional — Functional obstruction is caused by abnormal contraction of the periurethral muscle (dysfunctional voiding [DV] or detrusor sphincter dyssynergia), failure of urethral relaxation (Fowler's syndrome), failure of pelvic floor muscle relaxation, or failure of bladder neck relaxation (primary bladder neck obstruction) . Functional obstruction requires urodynamic evaluation for diagnosis, often with videocystourethrography or electromyography.\n【33】 Dysfunctional voiding — DV is defined as \"an intermittent and/or fluctuating flow rate due to involuntary intermittent contractions of the periurethral striated muscle during voiding in neurologically normal individuals\" . In contrast to detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, there is no neurologic cause for the findings. DV appears to be a learned behavior. In physiologic voiding, the pelvic floor muscles and external striated sphincter should relax just prior to detrusor contraction. In a retrospective review of 26 female patients diagnosed with DV, the mean age was 39 years, urgency and frequency were the most frequent presenting symptoms (82 percent), and episodes of urinary retention were reported in 19 percent . One of the subjects with DV had vesicoureteral reflux and bilateral hydronephrosis, demonstrating the potential for upper tract damage with prolonged bladder outlet obstruction.\n【34】 Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia — Women with neurologic disease that results in disruption between the pontine micturition center of the brain and the caudal spinal cord can develop detrusor sphincter dyssynergia . Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia is an obstructive cause of CUR, in contrast to CUR caused by DU, which can also be\n【35】 In detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, detrusor contraction occurs simultaneously with inappropriate contraction of the urethral striated muscle, the periurethral striated muscle, or both . The end result is blockage of the bladder outlet. In a meta-analysis of five trials, the most common neurologic diseases causing detrusor sphincter dyssynergia were traumatic spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, and congenital anomalies .\n【36】 Fowler's syndrome — Another type of urethral abnormality that can result in functional BOO is Fowler’s syndrome. Fowler’s syndrome typically presents in young women (mean age 27 years old) as painless urinary retention (often in excess of 1 L) with no neurologic or anatomic etiology . The diagnosis is made by a characteristic electromyography pattern that demonstrates failure of urethral sphincter relaxation, decrease in bladder sensation, and complex repetitive discharges are often present. It is not known if Fowler’s syndrome represents a subgroup of patients with DV or a distinct clinical entity in young women with CUR.\n【37】 Primary bladder neck obstruction — In addition to abnormalities of urethral relaxation, functional BOO can be caused by primary bladder neck obstruction, which is thought to be the result of non-relaxation of the smooth muscle at the bladder neck during voiding . Though the series describing diagnostic features of primary bladder neck obstruction is small, these patients tend to have significantly increased PVR (400 mL versus 125 mL) and lower flow rates compared with the dysfunctional voiding population.\n【38】 CLINICAL PRESENTATION — Women with CUR often present complaining of partial or slow voiding or may be unable to void at all. In contrast to acute urinary retention, CUR is usually not painful. Additional symptoms include:\n【39】 Paradoxically, women with CUR from minimal or absent detrusor function can also present with overflow urinary incontinence. These women do not void but have constant urinary leakage from the overfilled bladder. Complete urinary retention with overflow incontinence is unusual in neurologically intact female patients. In one study of over 1100 women with lower urinary tract symptoms, overflow incontinence was diagnosed in 0.5 percent of women .\n【40】 While many women with CUR will have some voiding complaints, symptoms such as sensation of incomplete bladder emptying are neither sensitive nor specific . As an example, in a cohort study of 258 women with voiding symptoms, 87 percent of women had a normal postvoid residual (defined as less than 100 mL) despite voiding complaints . Of the 57 women who were diagnosed with CUR by postvoid residual, the most common voiding symptom was sensation of incomplete emptying (30 percent).\n【41】 POTENTIAL COMPLICATIONS — Two concerns with CUR are the potential risk of infection and elevated bladder pressures, both of which can lead to upper tract injury and impairment of renal function. However, the actual risk and clinical significance of these is not fully defined in women with CUR.\n【42】 For women with CUR, urinary tract infection (UTI) is thought to be caused by retention and stagnation of urine that leads to bacteriuria and subsequent infection. However, it is unclear if CUR is truly a risk factor for bacteriuria in women, as data are mixed. In a study of postmenopausal women, women with culture-proven infections were more likely to have had any residual volume compared with women without infections (23 percent versus 2 percent) . In contrast, in studies of nursing home residents, there was no association between postvoid residual (PVR) and UTI, and elevated PVR ≥100 mL did not confer a greater risk of UTI . Similar findings have been reported in younger women as well. In a study of 213 college-aged women, there was no difference in mean PVR between women with recurrent UTIs and those without (mean PVR 43 versus 49 mL, respectively) .\n【43】 CUR has the potential to cause renal damage, if accompanied by high-pressure storage, through the transmission of elevated bladder pressures to the upper urinary tract. The majority of literature looking at the relationship between retention, bladder pressure, and upper tract disease has been in patients with neurologic disease or in males with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). In contrast, the majority of CUR in neurologically intact women is due to detrusor underactivity rather than BOO. Therefore, it is unlikely that women with non-neurogenic CUR are at risk for renal damage from elevated detrusor pressures. If a patient does meet the American Urological Association (AUA) definition of CUR (PVR >300 mL for at least six months documented on at least two separate occasions), a renal ultrasound and serum creatinine measurement is advised . In addition, the AUA Quality Improvement and Patient Safety workgroup defined CUR patients at high risk for renal disease as those with concomitant hydronephrosis, hydroureter, bladder stones, Stage 3 chronic kidney disease, or recurrent urinary tract infections or urosepsis.\n【44】 DIAGNOSIS — CUR is suspected in women who present with obstructive lower urinary tract symptoms, and the diagnosis is made by confirming an elevated postvoid residual urine volume (PVR). An abnormal test should be repeated as a single test is not highly reliable . Because CUR can be associated with a range of voiding symptoms, we typically measure PVR by bladder scan on all new patients in our referral practice. The bladder scan is less invasive, has less potential to cause discomfort, and has acceptable correlation to catheterized PVR volumes. If the bladder scan is significantly elevated or if there is a high index of suspicion despite a normal PVR, we will perform a catheterized PVR to confirm. Once an elevated PVR has been established, we then proceed with a diagnostic evaluation to determine the cause.\n【45】 PVR is defined as the volume of urine left in the bladder at the completion of micturition . Consensus exists that a PVR of 50 mL to 100 mL is normal, PVR greater than 200 mL is abnormal, and PVR between 100 mL and 200 mL requires clinical correlation . In the subpopulation of women with lower urinary tract symptoms, several studies support the use of 100 mL as the normal cut-off .\n【46】 Assessment of PVR can be done with bladder catheterization or bladder ultrasound, commonly referred to as a bladder scan. Compared with bladder catheterization, bladder ultrasound is noninvasive, easier to perform, and preferred by patients. Standard ultrasonography may be used as well; however, multiple measurements are required to calculate an accurate bladder volume. Studies have demonstrated high correlation between bladder ultrasound PVR and catheterized PVR, in both benign gynecologic and urogynecologic populations . Bladder ultrasound may be less accurate in obese patients (greater tissue depth) or in patients with ascites (adjacent fluid levels may be read as one volume). These women benefit from bladder catheterization to determine the PVR if there is clinical suspicion of incomplete emptying.\n【47】 EVALUATION FOR THE UNDERLYING ETIOLOGY — We begin the evaluation of women with CUR by obtaining a complete history, including urinary, defecatory, and prolapse symptoms. While symptoms are neither sensitive nor specific for the etiology of CUR, a history can be helpful in identifying specific risk factors. For example, a sensation of incomplete emptying in a woman with a history of an anti-incontinence sling surgery is concerning for urinary obstruction at the urethra.\n【48】 After obtaining the history, we perform a physical examination that includes a pelvic examination, pelvic organ prolapse quantification if appropriate, and focused neurologic testing   \"Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Diagnostic evaluation\", section on 'Approach to the examination'). Either bladder ultrasound or catheterization is used to measure postvoid residual (PVR) within 10 minutes of voiding. Urinalysis and urine culture is performed to detect urinary tract infection as women with obstruction often present with both irritative and obstructive urinary symptoms.\n【49】 The above examination can identify potentially reversible causes of CUR such as urinary tract infection, pelvic organ prolapse, leiomyomata, and mesh erosion. After office treatment of any suspected cause of CUR (pessary for prolapse, urinary tract infection treatment), urodynamic evaluation can help determine if the cause is detrusor underactivity (DU), bladder outlet obstruction (BOO), or a combination. Women who are diagnosed with BOO typically require additional testing to determine if the obstruction is anatomic or functional and the subtype of functional obstruction, if present. These tests can include cystourethroscopy, video urodynamic evaluation, and electromyography. Cystourethroscopy visualizes the urethra and bladder to diagnose anatomic causes of obstruction. Video urodynamic evaluation utilizes fluoroscopy at the time of voiding to correlate pressure, flow, and anatomic location of obstruction. Electromyography performed during micturition measures activity in the urethral sphincter and pelvic floor muscles. These additional tests can help distinguish subtypes of functional obstruction such as dysfunctional voiding, detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, and primary bladder neck obstruction.\n【50】 Urodynamic evaluation — Urodynamic evaluation can help determine the underlying mechanism of CUR. The constellation of findings on urodynamic evaluation can help to distinguish DU from BOO.\n【51】 In addition to an elevated PVR, women with CUR can demonstrate the following patterns on their urodynamic evaluation :\n【52】 Additional tests — Additional testing can be useful to further refine the diagnosis after urodynamic evaluation. Urodynamic evaluation can identify bladder outlet obstruction, but cannot determine if the obstruction is anatomic or functional. Women at risk for anatomic obstruction proceed with cystourethroscopy to evaluate the urethra, bladder neck, and bladder. Risk factors for anatomic obstruction include a history of prior anti-incontinence or prolapse surgery, pelvic mass on examination, and prior urethral surgery or procedures. Videocystourethrography is performed to rule out an anatomic or functional cause of obstruction that is only present or visible during voiding, such as increased urethral sphincter or pelvic floor activity. EMG is done for women with evidence of obstruction but no identified anatomic abnormality. EMG can assess pelvic floor muscle activity (patch EMG) or periurethral muscle activity (needle EMG), and evaluate for abnormal contraction or relaxation of the pelvic floor and urethra that results in outlet obstruction.\n【53】 In addition, women at risk for upper tract disease, such as those with increased bladder pressure during filling, which indicates low compliance, can benefit from renal ultrasound to evaluate the upper urinary tract for hydronephrosis.\n【54】 Cystourethroscopy — Cystourethroscopy can identify urethral anatomic causes for obstruction such as stricture, mass, or erosion of surgical material. In addition to women with known risk factors (eg, prior pelvic surgery), women with recurrent urinary tract infections and hematuria also undergo cystourethroscopy in order to evaluate for a foreign body or mass. In women with a history of a midurethral sling and symptoms of erosion, cystoscopy is performed to rule out erosion into the lower urinary tract. Careful attention must be paid to the urethroscopy portion to identify any sling material; a 0 degree lens is helpful for a circumferential view of the urethra.\n【55】 Video urodynamic evaluation — Imaging during urodynamic testing, or video urodynamic evaluation, is the synchronous imaging of the bladder and urethra and measurement of bladder and abdominal pressures during filling cystometry and pressure flow study . In some practices, video assessment (typically with fluoroscopy) is done during all urodynamic evaluations, while other practices utilize a more selective process. This test is also referred to as videocystourethrography.\n【56】 For this technique, dual-channel cystometry is performed with the instillation of contrast media into the bladder and allows simultaneous imaging of the bladder during filling and voiding . For women who have suspected BOO but no etiology evident on physical examination or cystoscopy, video urodynamic evaluation can identify functional causes of BOO such as dysfunctional voiding and primary bladder neck obstruction . As an example, primary bladder neck obstruction is diagnosed by imaging the bladder neck during voiding and confirming a failure of the bladder neck to open during a detrusor contraction .\n【57】 Electromyography — EMG can be done via surface patch electrode or with a needle probe. Surface patch electrode EMG is commonly done as part of the urodynamic evaluation and detects electrical potentials for a group of muscles . Thus, surface patch electrodes only measure general pelvic floor muscle activity and are less reliable for assessing periurethral muscle activity .\n【58】 For women with an unclear diagnosis but suspected functional obstruction, needle EMG can differentiate the subtypes of functional BOO. As an example, in one study of 15 women with voiding dysfunction, concentric needle EMG of the external urethra differentiated between women with normal pelvic floor activity but abnormal external urethral sphincter activity (ie, relaxed pelvic floor with abnormally contracted urethra) and women with inappropriate pubococcygeus muscle activation but normal external urethral sphincter activity (ie, abnormally contracted pelvic floor but relaxed urethra) . In contrast, women with primary bladder neck obstruction will demonstrate a quiet EMG pattern in the pelvic floor and urethral muscles despite high detrusor pressure and low flow rate on urodynamic evaluation. These findings reflect a failure of relaxation at the bladder neck and not an activation of periurethral muscles . The major disadvantages of needle EMG include invasiveness and limited availability.\n【59】 Ultrasound — The American Urological Association Consensus paper recommends renal ultrasound for patients that meet their definition of CUR (PVR >300 mL for at least six months documented on at least two separate occasions) . In addition, renal ultrasound to evaluate for hydronephrosis/ureter may be useful in women at risk for renal damage from CUR, including those with spinal cord injury or disease, Stage 3 or 4 pelvic organ prolapse, and poor bladder compliance in the setting of high storage pressure.\n【60】 TREATMENT OF URINARY RETENTION — The initial intervention of CUR is aimed at resolving the urinary retention. Subsequent therapy is directed at treating the underlying etiology of CUR.  'Treatment of etiology' below.)\n【61】 Women who are unable to void — Women with complete urinary retention are unable to void and require immediate bladder drainage. The most common methods are an indwelling bladder catheter, clean intermittent self-catheterization, or insertion of a suprapubic catheter. Options for bladder drainage are reviewed separately.   \"Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults\", section on 'Choice of catheter'.)\n【62】 Women with incomplete emptying — In contrast to women with complete urinary retention, most women will be able to void some urine. This incomplete emptying, or partial voiding, results in urine accumulation in the bladder and the potential sequelae associated with urinary retention  'Potential complications' above). Depending on the degree of retention and associated symptoms, these women can be taught clean intermittent catheterization. Scheduled bladder drainage minimizes the risk of detrusor injury from overdistention and prevents transmission of high bladder pressures to the upper tract. The woman must have adequate cognitive function and mobility to perform clean intermittent catheterization herself.   \"Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults\", section on 'Clean intermittent catheterization'.)\n【63】 A subgroup of women can be candidates for observation. Women can be safely observed if they have low filling pressures, no imaging evidence of upper tract involvement (eg, hydronephrosis), and normal renal function.\n【64】 TREATMENT OF ETIOLOGY — Treatment choice for CUR in women depends on the etiology and severity of symptoms.\n【65】 Women with detrusor underactivity — As there is no universally effective treatment for detrusor underactivity (DU), women with clinically significant retention from DU are typically managed with clean intermittent self-catheterization to periodically drain the bladder . A 2014 systematic review based on four studies and one systematic review concluded that, while women with DU treated with sacral neuromodulation showed some improvement, there were insufficient data to determine the optimal treatment for these women . Sacral neuromodulation can be trialed in women with non-neurogenic refractory DU.   \"Placement and management of urinary bladder catheters in adults\", section on 'Clean intermittent catheterization'.)\n【66】 Sacral neuromodulation — While the optimal treatment of women with DU is not known, sacral neuromodulation is an option to treat refractory DU that is not neurogenic. Sacral neuromodulation also appears effective for some patients with refractory obstructive CUR that is functional in nature .  'Functional' below.)\n【67】 Supporting data are limited by small sample sizes:\n【68】 Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation – Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation is a less invasive method of sacral modulation approved for the treatment of overactive bladder. In a 2021 systematic review of 5 studies of patients with idiopathic nonobstructive urinary retention, objective success rates (≥50 percent decrease in catheterizations per 24 hours) ranged from 25 to 41 percent, subjective success (patient request for device implantation) ranged from 47 to 59 percent, and PVR decreased a median of 76 to 83 mL over a 12-week treatment period. Longer term data were not available.\n【69】 More information on sacral neuromodulation can be found separately.   \"Urgency urinary incontinence/overactive bladder (OAB) in females: Treatment\", section on 'Sacral neuromodulation'.)\n【70】 Intraurethral valve-pump — An intraurethral valve-pump may be an alternate option to intermittent self-catheterization for women with DU and resultant CUR. The device does not remedy the DU itself. Women who may benefit include those with physical limitations that preclude self-catheterization or those who no longer wish to perform catheterization.\n【71】 The device is comprised of a short silicone urethral catheter with an internal pump and valve mechanism that is operated by a patient-initiated external remote control unit . The catheter is replaced once a month. In a multicenter crossover study of 77 women, the postvoid residual was similar between women using the valve-pump and clean intermittent catheterization techniques (16 versus 20 mL) . The quality of life score improved significantly with valve-pump use compared with clean intermittent catheterization. However, 62 percent (169/273) of women withdrew from the study because of discomfort and urine leakage. A published clinician experience reported the device was successful in a small number of carefully selected patients who were reliant on indwelling catheters due to inability to perform clean intermittent catheterization . However, use may be limited by lack of insurance coverage, including Medicare.\n【72】 Ineffective treatments\n【73】 Women with obstruction\n【74】 Anatomic — For women with anatomic obstruction (ie, prolapse, urethral stricture, mass or tumor, foreign body), urinary retention will usually resolve with correction of the obstruction, particularly in women with adequate detrusor function. As an example, in one study of 35 women with Stage 3 or 4 pelvic organ prolapse and elevated postvoid residual (PVR >100 cc), 89 percent had normal PVRs after surgical correction of the prolapse . Similarly, in a study of 24 women with pelvic organ prolapse and urinary retention, 75 percent of women demonstrated an improved PVR after pessary insertion to resolve the prolapse . In women with urethral erosion from a prior anti-incontinence sling procedure, transvaginal sling excision and urethral reconstruction relieves the retention in most patients . Urethral dilation is not used to treat obstruction unless there is a defined anatomical reason to necessitate this procedure, such as a urethral stricture.   \"Transvaginal synthetic mesh: Management of exposure and pain following pelvic surgery\", section on 'Mesh exposure'.)\n【75】 Functional — Treatment options for functional causes of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) include pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback, medication, sacral neuromodulation, sphincteric injections with botulinum toxin, and bladder neck incision (in select patients) . The approach depends on type of functional BOO. Detailed information on pelvic floor muscle training and sacral neuromodulation is presented separately.   \"Myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in females: Pelvic floor physical therapy for management\", section on 'Rehabilitation' and  \"Female urinary incontinence: Treatment\", section on 'Initial treatment'.)\n【76】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Urinary incontinence in adults\".)\n", "title": "女性慢性尿潴留", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/chronic-urinary-retention-in-females?search=%E6%B3%A8%E5%B0%84%E7%A5%9E%E7%BB%8F%E6%AF%92%E7%B4%A0%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%8D%E8%89%AF%E5%8F%8D%E5%BA%94&source=search_result&selectedTitle=16%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:39:33"}

Suspect factor VIII antibodies if the plasma factor VIII level does not increase as expected or if bleeding is not controlled after administration.\n【41】 Hypersensitivity reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) may occur; discontinue immediately if hypersensitivity symptoms occur and administer appropriate treatment.\n【42】 Blood types A, B, and AB: Contains trace amounts of blood groups A and B isohemagglutinins; use caution when large or frequently repeated doses are given to individuals with blood groups A, B, and AB. Monitor patients for signs of intravascular hemolysis and falling hematocrit; discontinue therapy and consider administration of serologically compatible type O red blood cells if progressive hemolytic anemia occurs.\n【43】 Albumin: Products vary by preparation method; final formulations contain human albumin.\n【44】 Human plasma: Product of human plasma; may potentially contain infectious agents which could transmit disease. Screening of donors, as well as testing and/or inactivation or removal of certain viruses, reduces the risk. Infections thought to be transmitted by this product should be reported to the manufacturer. Hepatitis A and B vaccination is recommended for all patients receiving plasma derivatives.\n【45】 Mouse protein: Hemofil M contains trace amounts of mouse protein; use is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to mouse protein.\n【46】 Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995).

If bleeding is not controlled with adequate dose, test for the presence of factor VIII inhibitor; larger doses of AHF may be therapeutic with inhibitor titers <10 Bethesda units/mL; it may not be possible or practical to control bleeding if inhibitor titers >10 Bethesda units/mL (due to the very large AHF doses required); other treatments [eg, antihemophilic factor (porcine), factor IX complex concentrates, recombinant factor VIIa, or anti-inhibitor coagulant complex] may be needed in patients with inhibitor titers >10 Bethesda units/mL.\n【74】 Administration: Pediatric\n【75】 Parenteral: IV administration only; use administration sets/tubing provided by manufacturer (if provided). Administer through a separate line, do not mix with drugs or other IV fluids.\n【76】 Intermittent IV: Rate of administration should be determined by patient tolerability (maximum rates vary by product).\n【77】 Hemofil M, Koate: 10 mL/minute.\n【78】 Monoclate-P: 2 mL/minute.\n【79】 WFH recommendations (Srivastava 2013): Infuse at a rate determined by age: Young children: 100 units/minute; Adults: 3 mL/minute.\n【80】 Continuous IV infusion: Further dilution after initial reconstitution is unnecessary (Batorova 2012; Prelog 2016).\n【81】 Administration: Adult\n【82】 Continuous infusion (off-label rate): Has also been administered as a continuous infusion to avoid peaks and troughs associated with intermittent infusions in patients who require prolonged treatment periods. Use a smart infusion pump with small volume infusion capability. Refer to protocols for product selection and preparation details (Batorova 2002; Batorova 2012; Holme 2018; Martinowitz 1992; Poon 2012; Rickard 1995; WFH [Srivastava 2020]).\n【83】 Storage/Stability\n【84】 Store under refrigeration, 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F); do not freeze.

Store in original package to protect from light.\n【87】 Use\n【88】 Control and prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with hemophilia A (classical hemophilia) and perioperative management of patients with hemophilia A (All indications: Monoclate-P, Hemofil M: FDA-approved in pediatric patients [age not specified] and adults; Koate: FDA approved in ages ≥2.5 years and adults). Has also been used to provide therapeutic effects in patients with acquired factor VIII inhibitors <10 Bethesda units/mL.\n【89】 Medication Safety Issues\n【90】 Other safety concerns:\n【91】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【92】 None known.\n【93】 Drug Interactions\n【94】 There are no known significant interactions.\n【95】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【96】 Pregnant carriers of hemophilia A may have an increased bleeding risk following invasive procedures, spontaneous miscarriage, termination of pregnancy, and delivery; close surveillance is recommended. Factor VIII levels should be monitored at the first antenatal visit, once or twice during the third trimester, prior to surgical or invasive procedures, and at delivery. Although factor VIII concentrations increase in pregnant patients, factor VIII replacement is recommended if concentrations are <50 units/dL and any of the following occur: need for invasive procedures (including delivery), spontaneous miscarriage, insertion and removal of epidural catheters, or active bleeding. Hemostatic factor VIII concentrations should be maintained for at least 3 to 5 days following invasive procedures or postpartum. If a replacement product is indicated, a recombinant product is preferred (NHF 2017; RCOG [Pavord 2017]; WFH [Srivastava 2020]).\n【97】 Monitoring Parameters\n【98】 Monitor factor VIII levels prior to and during treatment; heart rate and blood pressure (before and during IV administration); monitor for signs and symptoms of bleeding, hemoglobin and hematocrit, and for hypersensitivity reactions; monitor for development of inhibitor antibodies by clinical observation (eg, inadequate control of bleeding with adequate doses) and laboratory tests (eg, inhibitor level, Bethesda assay). In patients with blood groups A, B, or AB who receive large or frequent doses, monitor Hct, direct Coombs' test, and signs of intravascular hemolysis.\n【99】 Classification of hemophilia; normal is defined as 1 unit/mL of factor VIII (WFH [Srivastava 2013])\n【100】 Severe: Factor level <1% of normal.\n【101】 Moderate: Factor level 1% to 5% of normal.\n【102】 Mild: Factor level 5% to <40% of normal.\n【103】 Mechanism of Action\n【104】 Protein (factor VIII) in normal plasma which is necessary for clot formation and maintenance of hemostasis; activates factor X in conjunction with activated factor IX; activated factor X converts prothrombin to thrombin, which converts fibrinogen to fibrin, and with factor XIII forms a stable clot\n【105】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【106】 Distribution: Does not readily cross the placenta\n【107】 Half-life elimination: Mean: 14.8 to 17.5 hours\n【108】 Brand Names: International\n【109】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Factor VIII, human plasma-derived  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/factor-viii-human-plasma-derived-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E9%81%97%E4%BC%A0%E6%80%A7%E5%9B%A0%E5%AD%90VIII%E7%BC%BA%E4%B9%8F%E4%BC%B4%E6%8A%97%E5%9B%A0%E5%AD%90VIII%E7%9A%84%E6%8A%91%E5%88%B6%E7%89%A9&source=search_result&selectedTitle=85%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 19:44:48"}

Consult drug interactions database for more information.\n【79】 Warnings/Precautions\n【80】 Altered cardiac conduction: Antipsychotics may alter cardiac conduction; life-threatening arrhythmias have occurred with therapeutic doses of antipsychotics (Haddad 2002). Relative to other antipsychotics, lurasidone has minimal effects on the QTc interval and therefore, risk for arrhythmias is low.\n【81】 Falls: May increase the risk for falls due to somnolence, orthostatic hypotension, and motor or sensory instability.\n【82】 Orthostatic hypotension: May cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope; use with caution in patients at risk of this effect (eg, concurrent medication use which may predispose to hypotension/bradycardia or presence of dehydration or hypovolemia) or in those who would not tolerate transient hypotensive episodes. Use caution with history of cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, heart failure, or ischemic disease).\n【83】 Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with severe cardiac disease, hemodynamic instability, prior myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease.\n【84】 Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic disease or impairment; dosage reduction is recommended in moderate to severe impairment.\n【85】 Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal disease; dosage reduction is recommended in moderate to severe impairment.\n【86】 Seizures: Use with caution in patients at risk of seizures, including those with a history of seizures or conditions that lower the seizure threshold such as Alzheimer disease. Elderly patients may be at increased risk of seizures due to an increased prevalence of predisposing factors.\n【87】 Discontinuation of therapy: When discontinuing antipsychotic therapy, gradually taper antipsychotics to avoid physical withdrawal symptoms and rebound symptoms (APA [Keepers 2020]; WFSBP [Hasan 2012]). Withdrawal symptoms may include agitation, alternating feelings of warmth and cold, anxiety, diaphoresis, dyskinesia, GI symptoms, insomnia, irritability, myalgia, paresthesia, psychosis, restlessness, rhinorrhea, tremor and vertigo (Lambert 2007; Moncrieff 2020). The risk of withdrawal symptoms is highest following abrupt discontinuation of highly anticholinergic or dopaminergic antipsychotics (Cerovecki 2013). Patients with chronic symptoms, repeated relapses, and clear diagnostic features of schizophrenia are at risk for poor outcomes if medications are discontinued (APA [Keepers 2020]).\n【88】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【89】 Pediatric psychiatric disorders are frequently serious mental disorders which present with variable symptoms that do not always match adult diagnostic criteria. Conduct a thorough diagnostic evaluation and carefully consider risks of psychotropic medication before initiation in pediatric patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Medication therapy for pediatric patients with these disorders is indicated as part of a total treatment program that frequently includes educational, psychological, and social interventions. Long-term usefulness of lurasidone should be periodically reevaluated in patients receiving the drug for extended periods of time. Although other second-generation antipsychotics have shown efficacy in the management of autism, efficacy data for lurasidone is lacking (Loebel 2016; McClellan 2017); in a 6-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 150 children and adolescents (age range: 6 to 17 years; n=49 lurasidone 20 mg treatment group, n=51 lurasidone 60 mg treatment group, and n=50 placebo), once daily lurasidone was not shown to be more effective than placebo in treatment of moderate to severe irritability associated with autistic disorder (Loebel 2016).\n【90】 Dosage Forms: US\n【91】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【92】 Tablet, Oral, as hydrochloride:\n【93】 Latuda: 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg\n【94】 Latuda: 80 mg [contains fd&c blue #2 (indigo carm) aluminum lake]\n【95】 Latuda: 120 mg\n【96】 Generic: 20 mg, 40 mg, 60 mg, 80 mg, 120 mg\n【97】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【98】 Yes\n【99】 Pricing: US\n【100】 20 mg (per each): $56.75\n【101】 40 mg (per each): $56.75\n【102】 60 mg (per each): $56.75\n【103】 80 mg (per each): $56.75\n【104】 120 mg (per each): $84.71\n【105】 20 mg (per each): $0.83 - $53.91\n【106】 40 mg (per each): $32.74 - $53.91\n【107】 60 mg (per each): $31.87 - $53.91\n【108】 80 mg (per each): $32.67 - $53.91\n【109】 120 mg (per each): $3.37 - $80.47\n【110】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【111】 Administration: Adult\n【112】 Administration: Pediatric\n【113】 Oral: Administer with food (≥350 calories).

Management: Administer with food (≥350 calories).\n【256】 Lurasidone serum concentrations may be increased when taken with grapefruit or grapefruit juice. Management: Avoid concurrent use.\n【257】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【258】 Antipsychotic use during the third trimester of pregnancy has a risk for abnormal muscle movements (extrapyramidal symptoms [EPS]) and/or withdrawal symptoms in newborns following delivery. Symptoms in the newborn may include agitation, feeding disorder, hypertonia, hypotonia, respiratory distress, somnolence, and tremor; these effects may be self-limiting or require hospitalization. Lurasidone may cause hyperprolactinemia, which may decrease reproductive function in both males and females.\n【259】 The ACOG recommends that therapy during pregnancy be individualized; treatment with psychiatric medications during pregnancy should incorporate the clinical expertise of the mental health clinician, obstetrician, primary healthcare provider, and pediatrician. Safety data related to atypical antipsychotics during pregnancy is limited and routine use is not recommended. However, if a woman is inadvertently exposed to an atypical antipsychotic while pregnant, continuing therapy may be preferable to switching to a typical antipsychotic that the fetus has not yet been exposed to; consider risk:benefit (ACOG 2008).\n【260】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【261】 It is not known if lurasidone is excreted in breast milk. According to the manufacturer, the decision to continue or discontinue breast-feeding during therapy should take into account the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breast-feeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother.\n【262】 Dietary Considerations\n【263】 Should be taken with food (≥350 calories). Avoid grapefruit and grapefruit juice.\n【264】 Monitoring Parameters\n【265】 Timing of serum samples: Draw trough just before next dose (Hiemke 2018).\n【266】 Laboratory alert level: 120 ng/mL (SI: 243.6 nmol/L) (Hiemke 2018).\n【267】 Mechanism of Action\n【268】 Lurasidone is a benzoisothiazol-derivative atypical antipsychotic with mixed serotonin-dopamine antagonist activity. It exhibits high affinity for D2, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors; moderate affinity for alpha2C-adrenergic receptors; and is a partial agonist for 5-HT1A receptors. Lurasidone has no significant affinity for muscarinic M1 and histamine H1 receptors.

They subsequently reported their series of 119 patients in 1951 . Although individuals were referred with a diagnosis of \"lymphedema,\" they noted a unique phenotype. Unlike patients with lymphedema, subjects were always female, both lower extremities were affected, the feet were spared, and the patients did not have infections . They termed the condition \"lipedema\" because some patients also exhibited minor swelling . However, because \"edema\" was included in the name of the disease, a misconception has existed that swelling is a primary component of the disorder, causing confusion and mislabeling as lymphedema .\n【3】 The condition is fundamentally a lipodystrophy with abnormal deposition of subcutaneous adipose tissue in the lower extremities. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the subcutaneous fat appears normal but is circumferentially increased. Histology of the adipose does not show an abnormality. Unlike lymphedema, fibrosis and dermal thickening are not present in patients without obesity . One hypothesis to explain reported pain is inflammation and hypoxia from elevated macrophages and fat necrosis . European Consensus Guidelines recommend renaming the disorder \"lipalgia syndrome\" .\n【4】 The etiology of lipedema is not well understood. The disease appears to be caused by a germline mutation because it follows an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with incomplete penetrance (16 to 44 percent of patients report their mothers also had the condition) . Potential candidate genes responsible for lipedema include VEGFA, GRB14-COBLL1, and LHFPL6 .\n【5】 Although edema is not a classic clinical feature of lipedema, it can occur secondarily from obesity and inflammation. Lipedema predisposes patients to obesity because their enlarged lower extremities increase the weight of the patient and interfere with exercise. Based on modern understanding, obesity impairs lymphatic function, and when body mass index (BMI) exceeds 30, lower extremity swelling develops . Patients with swelling in the original reports by Allen and Hines likely had a higher BMI. Individuals with a BMI >30 and leg swelling with normal lymphatic function by lymphoscintigraphy have what is termed \"obesity without lymphedema\" (OWL) . Subjects with a BMI >40 and abnormal lymphatic function have \"obesity-induced lymphedema\" (OIL) . Consequently, patients can be primarily afflicted with lipedema, gain weight, and then secondarily develop swelling (OWL or OIL) .\n【6】 European Consensus Guidelines do not include edema in the diagnostic criteria for lipedema . If swelling is present, it is secondary to localized inflammation caused by the diseased fat or related to increased body mass index (BMI). In the originally reported series, only 25 percent exhibited edema that was \"minor\" . Many subjects were obese, and it is likely these were the individuals with reported swelling. In a later review, 8 of 9 patients were not obese and only had minor focal edema of the pretibial area .\n【7】 Lipedema does not exhibit significant progression in patients who maintain a normal BMI. However, if patients gain weight their lymphatic function becomes compromised, resulting in edema. As many as 80 percent of patients with lipedema have a BMI >30 . The higher the BMI, the more likely it is that irreversible lymphedema will develop . As BMI increases, patients enter an unfavorable cycle of increased subcutaneous adipose deposition that occurs with both obesity and lymphedema, causing progressive leg enlargement.\n【8】 The skin proximal to the second toe is able to be pinched (ie, negative Stemmer sign), indicating normal lymphatic function .\n【9】 If the individual with lipedema has a BMI >30, and especially for BMI>40, the classic physical examination signs of lipedema (ie, lower extremities out of proportion with the rest of the body, no involvement of the feet, minimal swelling, negative Stemmer sign) may not be present because of the confounding clinical features of obesity, with or without lymphedema.\n【10】 Adolescent females or young adult females are more likely to present with the classical clinical features (ie, lower extremities out of proportion with the rest of the body, no involvement of the feet, minimal swelling, negative Stemmer sign) described above  'Classic features' above). The patient typically notes that by age 18 the size of their lower extremities became out of proportion with the rest of their body and that they were either a normal weight or mildly overweight. They complain that their lower extremities ache and bruise easily.\n【11】 In adults with obesity, historical information may suggest a diagnosis of lipedema. However, the classic physical examination signs of lipedema may not be present if the individual has a BMI >30, and especially for BMI >40.\n【12】 Lymphoscintigraphy is obtained for patients with a BMI >30 to help differentiate lipedema from obesity without lymphedema (OWL) and obesity-induced lymphedema (OIL).\n【13】 Lymphoscintigraphy is 96 percent sensitive and 100 percent specific for lymphedema . In patients with lipedema, lymphoscintigraphy will demonstrate normal lymphatic function provided the patient's BMI is less than 40 .\n【14】 Using lymphoscintigraphy and maximum BMI history will help differentiate lipedema from OWL and from OIL (algorithm 1).  'Differential diagnosis' below.)\n【15】 As body mass index (BMI) increases, lymphatics become damaged and swelling worsens. When lymphatic dysfunction occurs, patients will develop additional subcutaneous adipose overgrowth and enter a worsening cycle of weight gain and lymphatic injury. Patients who develop obesity-induced lymphedema (OIL) can further develop localized areas of soft tissue overgrowth of their thighs and genitalia (massive localized lymphedema) . The fundamental treatment for lower extremity overgrowth from obesity is weight loss.\n【16】 Primary lymphedema affects the lower extremities (90 percent) or upper extremities (10 percent). There are 31 known mutations can cause primary lymphedema . Primary lymphedema often is an autosomal dominant condition and patients may exhibit a family history, but either sex can be affected. Males most commonly present with bilateral leg edema in infancy, while females typically develop unilateral disease during adolescence .\n【17】 Secondary lymphedema causes 99 percent of cases of lymphedema and usually results from cancer treatment that includes lymphadenectomy or radiation to axillary or inguinal lymph nodes. In resource-abundant countries, the upper extremity is the most common site because of breast cancer management. Other causes of secondary lymphedema include trauma, infection, and OIL.\n【18】 Lymphedema initially increases extremity volume by high-protein fluid accumulation in the subcutaneous tissue. Over time, the inflammatory fluid stimulates subcutaneous adipose deposition further increasing the size of the leg . In contrast to lipedema and obesity, adipose tissue in lymphedema is much more inflamed and fibrotic. The feet are always involved and typically are the most severely affected part of the extremity. On lymphoscintigraphy, patients exhibit delayed transit of radiolabeled tracer to their inguinal nodes and/or dermal backflow.\n【19】 Because of the impaired lymphatic system, patients with lymphedema have an elevated risk of developing cellulitis in the affected extremity . Lymphedema is managed with compression strategies, exercise, weight reduction for those with obesity, and maintenance of a normal BMI. Patients with symptoms who are no longer responsive to conservative management can be managed operatively. Similar to lipedema, liposuction effectively removes the excess subcutaneous adipose tissue and also can improve the patient's lymphatic function .  'Liposuction' below.)\n【20】 Individuals with a body mass index (BMI) >30 and edema may benefit from compression therapy. Those with a BMI <30 and minimal edema are less likely to find compression therapy helpful, and it can worsen pain . Compression therapy might improve symptoms through its anti-inflammatory effects or effects in managing concurrent lymphedema .   \"Clinical staging and conservative management of peripheral lymphedema\".)\n【21】 Weight loss can reduce the amount of diseased adipose tissue in patients with lipedema . Although the legs will remain disproportionately larger than the rest of the body, symptoms can be improved .\n【22】 For those with a BMI>40, weight loss reduces ongoing injury to their lymphatic system. If the patient already has developed obesity-induced lymphedema (OIL), then reducing BMI <40 is necessary to decrease the progression of lymphedema. Although weight loss in patients with OIL does not cure the disease, it improves lymphatic function . Weight loss also is helpful for patients with a BMI between 30 to 40.\n【23】 Liposuction is more effective in early-stage lipedema. Performing liposuction on patients with a BMI >40 is associated with increased complications, unfavorable outcomes, and recurrence . Thus, patients with a BMI >40 are referred to a bariatric surgical weight loss program to help them reduce their BMI prior to liposuction. By contrast, the risks and outcome are favorable in patients who have a BMI <35. Liposuction can also be considered for very symptomatic individuals with a BMI between 36 and 39 if they have achieved their lowest possible BMI.   \"Bariatric surgery for management of obesity: Indications and preoperative preparation\".)\n【24】 Liposuction generally improves quality-of-life measures. In a prospective study, 511 patients with lipedema were provided quality-of-life surveys (World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF [WHOQOL-BREF] and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 [PHQ-9]) . Among those who proceeded with liposuction and completed both surveys before and after liposuction, there were significant improvements for physical functioning, including limitation in walking and occupational disability, quality of life, and satisfaction with appearance.\n【25】 Prior to surgery, candidates undergo lymphoscintigraphy (if not already done) and MRI to determine their lymphatic function and ensure there is extra subcutaneous adipose that would benefit from the procedure. The author prefers to operate on one extremity at a time with a minimum of six weeks in between procedures. Staging the legs allows immediate ambulation and reduces the risk of deep venous thrombosis.\n【26】 Following liposuction, patients are discharged to home the day after the procedure. Postoperatively, they are encouraged to ambulate immediately to reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism. The surgical dressing, which consists of gauze and elastic bandages, is changed in the office one week postoperatively. Thereafter, the patients maintain compression (eg, elastic bandages, compression garment) for six weeks postoperatively to maximize skin contraction.\n", "title": "Diagnosis and management of lipedema", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-lipedema?search=%E5%BF%83%E5%89%8D%E5%8C%BA%E7%96%BC%E7%97%9B&source=search_result&selectedTitle=141%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:25:15"}

Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【142】 Food Interactions\n【143】 Grapefruit juice may increase colchicine serum concentrations. Management: Administer orally with water and maintain adequate fluid intake. Avoid grapefruit juice.\n【144】 Dietary Considerations\n【145】 May need to supplement with vitamin B12. Avoid grapefruit juice.\n【146】 Reproductive Considerations\n【147】 Colchicine should not be discontinued in females with familial Mediterranean fever who are planning a pregnancy (EULAR [Ozen 2016]). Conception in females with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases should be planned during a period of quiescent/low disease activity (ACR [Sammaritano 2020]).\n【148】 Continuation of colchicine therapy is strongly recommended for use in males with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who are planning to father a child (ACR [Sammaritano 2020]). Use in males may rarely be associated with reversible infertility. A temporary dose reduction or discontinuation may be needed if azoospermia or oligospermia is related to use; however, men generally do not need to discontinue colchicine prior to conception (EULAR [Ozen 2016]).\n【149】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【150】 Colchicine crosses the placenta.\n【151】 Based on available information, an increased risk of major birth defects or pregnancy loss has not been observed following maternal use of colchicine for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, such as familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) (EULAR [Ozen 2016]; Indraratna 2018). However, untreated FMF is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including abortion, miscarriage, and exacerbations of FMF attacks (EULAR [Ozen 2016]).\n【152】 Colchicine can be continued during pregnancy in females with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (ACR [Sammaritano 2020]). Available guidelines recommend continuing colchicine during pregnancy for the treatment of conditions such as FMF when there are no acceptable alternatives and discontinuation of treatment may lead to uncontrolled disease and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Increased monitoring during pregnancy is recommended; amniocentesis is not warranted (ACR [Sammaritano 2020]; EULAR [Ozen 2016]).\n【153】 Monitoring Parameters\n【154】 CBC with differential, urinalysis, and renal and hepatic function tests\n【155】 FMF: CRP, serum amyloid A (SAA) protein (every 3 months during dose escalation), creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), proteinuria, GFR (EULAR [Ozen 2016])\n【156】 Mechanism of Action\n【157】 Disrupts cytoskeletal functions by inhibiting β-tubulin polymerization into microtubules, preventing activation, degranulation, and migration of neutrophils associated with mediating some gout symptoms. In familial Mediterranean fever, may interfere with intracellular assembly of the inflammasome complex present in neutrophils and monocytes that mediate activation of interleukin-1β.\n【158】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【159】 Onset of action: Oral: Pain relief: ~18 to 24 hours\n【160】 Distribution: Concentrates in leukocytes, kidney, spleen, and liver; does not distribute in heart, skeletal muscle, and brain\n【161】 Vd: 5 to 8 L/kg\n【162】 Protein binding: ~39%\n【163】 Metabolism: Hepatic via CYP3A4 and glucuronidation; 3 metabolites (2 primary, 1 minor)\n【164】 Bioavailability: ~45%\n【165】 Half-life elimination: 27 to 31 hours (multiple oral doses; young, healthy volunteers)\n【166】 Time to peak, serum: Oral: 0.5 to 3 hours\n【167】 Excretion: Urine (40% to 65% as unchanged drug); enterohepatic recirculation, biliary excretion, and p-glycoprotein efflux also possible\n【168】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【169】 Altered kidney function: Patients with ESRD had 75% lower clearance and prolonged elimination half-life.\n【170】 Hepatic function impairment: Clearance is significantly reduced and plasma half-life prolonged in patients with mild to moderate cirrhosis.\n【171】 Older adult: Mean peak plasma levels and AUC were 2 times higher in elderly patients; however, this may be caused by decreased renal function.\n【172】 Brand Names: International\n【173】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Colchicine  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/colchicine-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E6%80%A5%E6%80%A7%E9%A3%8E%E6%B9%BF%E7%83%AD%EF%BC%8C%E6%9C%AA%E6%8F%90%E5%8F%8A%E5%BF%83%E8%84%8F%E5%8F%97%E7%B4%AF&source=search_result&selectedTitle=101%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 21:59:45"}

{"id": 588785, "user_id": "6576f4e0014d3d1c31d6fe43", "user_name": "曾垂松", "task_id": 241, "source_info": {"seq_id": "7418", "text": "【0】 疑似颈椎损伤成人的影像学检查\n【1】 This topic describes cervical spine imaging in adults including the choice of modality, image-acquisition procedures, and diagnostic performance of the imaging examinations.\n【2】 In a hemodynamically unstable blunt trauma patient who is going to the operating room without CT imaging, a cross-table lateral cervical spine radiograph (obtained in the emergency department or operating room) may demonstrate an intervenable injury . However, in trauma patients, hemodynamic compromise should always be attributed to hemorrhagic shock and not neurogenic shock (ie, hypotension and bradycardia from loss of sympathetic tone due to spinal cord injury) until proven otherwise.   \"Acute traumatic spinal cord injury\" and  \"Approach to shock in the adult trauma patient\".)\n【3】 Cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are not routinely performed in patients with suspected spine injury. They are reserved for further evaluation of some patients following the initial evaluation with CT.\n【4】 Cervical spine CT is preferred over radiography because of its superior diagnostic performance and safety. Moreover, evaluating the spine with multidetector CT is faster, involves less patient movement, and results in far fewer technical failures requiring repeat imaging than with radiography. A meta-analysis of 3832 patients imaged for suspected cervical spine trauma calculated the pooled sensitivity of radiography and CT as 52 percent (95% CI 47-56 percent) and 98 percent (95% CI 96-99 percent), respectively, for identifying those with injury . However, there was insufficient evidence to suggest replacing radiography with CT for all patients because of heterogeneity and bias towards enrolling more injured patients in the included studies.\n【5】 The American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria rate CT as \"usually appropriate\" and above radiography in patients who have undergone blunt cervical spine trauma and meet criteria for imaging . Practice guidelines from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) recommend that multidetector CT be used as the primary method of screening for cervical trauma .\n【6】 For all patients who have sustained major trauma and are undergoing CT to assess for internal injury of the head, chest, or abdomen, cervical spine CT images are all acquired in the same sitting.\n【7】 If a cervical spine fracture is detected, the entire spinal column (ie, cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine), in general, is imaged. Fractures found at one level of the spine are associated with injury at other noncontiguous levels in approximately 20 percent of trauma patients . This issue is discussed separately.   \"Thoracic and lumbar spinal column injury in adults: Evaluation\", section on 'Decision rules for imaging thoracolumbar injury'.)\n【8】 Several studies have reported that a multidetector CT with multiplanar reformations has a sensitivity and specificity approximating 100 percent for a clinically significant injury in an alert and cooperative patient . As one example, a prospective multicenter trial performed by the Western Trauma Association involving 10,276 blunt trauma patients who did not meet National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study (NEXUS) exclusion criteria reported a sensitivity of 98.5 percent and a specificity of 91 percent, with a negative predictive value of 99.97 percent, for a clinically significant cervical spine injury (n = 198; defined as requiring surgery or stabilization with a halo or cervical-thoracic brace) . Three false negative results were reported, all in patients with focal neurologic findings during their initial examination consistent with central cord syndrome. In another prospective study of 1668 intoxicated blunt trauma patients, researchers reported a negative predictive value of 99.8 percent for clinically significant cervical spine injury .\n【9】 Although CT detects almost all fractures, it does not adequately image soft tissues such as ligaments, intervertebral discs, the spinal cord, and nerve roots. Thus, in patients with persistent or localizing signs and symptoms and a normal cervical spine CT, cervical spine MRI should be obtained.  'Further evaluation with magnetic resonance imaging' below.)\n【10】 Estimated radiation dose from cervical spine CT is 5 to 6 mSv.\n【11】 Assessment of bones in all three planes is required for accurate fracture diagnosis. Overall, spinal alignment is best assessed on the midsagittal view. For evaluating the specific articulations, the following planes are the most helpful:\n【12】 Finally, the prevertebral soft tissues are evaluated in soft tissue windows on the midsagittal image. Soft tissue contour should parallel the vertebral bodies and be uniformly thin from C1 to C4. This enables indirect detection of underlying edema or hematoma.\n【13】 While the lateral view is helpful in diagnosing spinal injuries, it is inadequate when used alone, detecting only 60 to 80 percent of fractures seen with a complete radiographic series . Diagnostic yield increases substantially when AP and odontoid views are added.\n【14】 In patients following major trauma or those who are obtunded for other reasons, adequate positioning to visualize the entire cervical spine is often not possible. Thus, radiography of the complete cervical spine with technically acceptable views cannot be obtained in up to 72 percent of patients .\n【15】 Cervical spine radiographs identify only about one-third of fractures detected with CT . If an adequate CT has been performed, radiographs are not needed for the initial evaluation, as they provide no additional information .\n【16】 Estimated radiation dose from cervical spine radiography is 1.5 to 2.0 mSv.\n【17】 Loss of cervical lordosis alone is not sufficient to diagnose a cervical spine injury in the absence of the positive findings .\n【18】 Lateral radiographs of the cervical spine with the neck in flexion and extension should not be performed in the acute setting .\n【19】 Whether additional imaging is useful in patients with an isolated spinal cord injury after a normal CT (ie, spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality [SCIWORA]) remains controversial . Clinicians should suspect a cervical ligamentous injury or SCIWORA in an alert patient with focal neurologic findings (eg, upper extremity weakness) or upper extremity paresthesias despite a normal CT examination. We generally do not obtain MRI in an alert patient with persistent neck pain or midline tenderness without neurologic signs or symptoms; a retrospective study of trauma patients with normal cervical spine CT but abnormal MRI found that superficial ligament injury that had occurred in this subcohort was not clinically significant .   \"Cervical spinal column injuries in adults: Evaluation and initial management\", section on 'Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality'.)\n【20】 Cervical spine clearance in an obtunded patient with a normal cervical spine CT is discussed separately.   \"Cervical spinal column injuries in adults: Evaluation and initial management\", section on 'Cervical spine clearance (removal of cervical collar)'.)\n【21】 MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting soft tissue injury, but its specificity for detecting clinically significant discoligamentous injury remains low. The false-positive rate of MRI is estimated between 20 and 40 percent for detecting clinically significant injuries . This may result in unnecessary morbidity. For example, in obtunded patients in the intensive care unit following trauma, adding MRI to CT for cervical spine clearance prolongs the period of rigid collar immobilization and mechanical ventilation, thereby increasing the risks for associated morbidities (eg, pressure ulcers, dysphagia, decreased cerebrovascular perfusion, elevated intracranial pressure, thromboembolism, ventilated associated infections, pressure ulcers, etc) .\n【22】 If the patient is unresponsive, determining that he or she is free of indwelling electromagnetic or metallic implants to undergo MRI safely sometimes may not be feasible. In such cases, available CT and/or plain-film imaging as well as the family or health care proxy should be consulted to clear the patient. In the absence of health care history, minimally plain films of the skull, neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be obtained to clear the patient before MRI. Obtunded patients should be monitored while in the scanner and ventilators, monitors, and other devices must be magnetic-resonance compatible .   \"Patient evaluation for metallic or electrical implants, devices, or foreign bodies before magnetic resonance imaging\".)\n【23】 In patients with trauma, CTA is generally preferred over MRA for logistical reasons. MRA involves longer table times, which, in an obtunded patient who cannot cooperate, will result in motion artifacts and poor image quality. Patient monitoring and support equipment are usually not magnetic-resonance compatible, which poses another hurdle. Thus, MRA is typically reserved for patients with contraindications to iodinated contrast or in patients who are undergoing another magnetic resonance exam for a separate indication (eg, brain or cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] for injury).\n", "title": "疑似颈椎损伤成人的影像学检查", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/suspected-cervical-spine-injury-in-adults-choice-of-imaging?search=%E9%A2%88%E8%84%8A%E9%AB%93%E7%9A%84%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E6%80%A7%E6%8D%9F%E5%AE%B3&source=search_result&selectedTitle=18%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:47:46"}

Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【77】 Vitamin D Analogs: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of other Vitamin D Analogs. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【78】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【79】 The ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) metabolite, 25(OH)D, crosses the placenta; maternal serum concentrations correlate with fetal concentrations at birth (Misra 2008; Wagner 2008).\n【80】 Vitamin D deficiency in a pregnant woman may lead to a vitamin D deficiency in the neonate (Misra 2008; Wagner 2008). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations should be measured in pregnant women considered to be at increased risk of deficiency (ACOG 2011). The amount of vitamin D contained in prenatal vitamins may not be adequate to treat a deficiency during pregnancy; although larger doses may be needed, current guidelines recommend a total of 1000 to 2000 units/day until more safety data is available (ACOG 2011). In women not at risk for deficiency, doses larger than the RDA should be avoided during pregnancy (ACOG 2011).\n【81】 Maternal vitamin D requirements are the same for breastfeeding and nonbreastfeeding females (IOM 2011). The maternal dose of vitamin D needed to provide the infant with an adequate amount of vitamin D is still under study (Wagner 2008)\n【82】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【83】 The 25(OH)D metabolite can be detected in breast milk. The manufacturer recommends that caution be used if ergocalciferol is administered to nursing women. Hypercalcemia has been noted in a breastfeeding infant following maternal use of large amounts of vitamin D; calcium serum concentrations should be monitored in nursing infants exposed to large doses.\n【84】 Small quantities of vitamin D are found in breast milk following normal maternal exposure via sunlight and diet. The amount in breast milk does not correlate with serum levels in the infant and the vitamin D content of human milk is not enough to meet the recommended intake for a nursing infant. Therefore, vitamin D supplementation is recommended in all infants who are partially or exclusively breast fed (Misra 2008; Wagner 2008).\n【85】 Dietary Considerations\n【86】 Vitamin D is found in egg yolks, fatty fish, fortified milk, fortified cereal, and infant formulas; it is also produced by exposure to sunlight (IOM 2011).\n【87】 Infants 0 to 12 months: Adequate intake: 10 mcg/day (400 units/day)\n【88】 1 to 70 years: RDA: 15 mcg/day (600 units/day)\n【89】 >70 years: RDA: 20 mcg/day (800 units/day)\n【90】 Pregnancy/Lactating: RDA: 15 mcg/day (600 units/day)\n【91】 Monitoring Parameters\n【92】 Signs/symptoms of vitamin D toxicity (eg, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, confusion, psychosis, tremor, calcification of soft tissue, nausea, weakness) (ASPEN [McKeever 2017])\n【93】 Adults:\n【94】 Serum 25(OH)D: For patients being treated for vitamin D deficiency with a baseline serum 25(OH)D level <20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L), measure ~3 to 4 months after initiation or dosage adjustment. In healthy patients initiating maintenance dosing, routine monitoring is not required (Dawson-Hughes 2022).\n【95】 Additional monitoring of calcium, phosphorous, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and alkaline phosphatase may be required depending on severity of 25(OH)D deficiency and/or concomitant clinical condition (eg, chronic kidney disease, hypoparathyroidism) (Dawson-Hughes 2022; ES [Brandi 2016]; KDIGO 2017).\n【96】 Infants, Children, and Adolescents:\n【97】 Vitamin D deficiency: Serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) one month after starting therapy; serum calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, ALP, 25(OH)D, and PTH as well as x-ray (may also consider urine calcium/creatinine ratio) after 3 months; 25(OH)D yearly (Misra 2008).\n【98】 Increased risk of vitamin D deficiency (eg, chronic fat malabsorption, chronic antiseizure medication use): Serum 25(OH)D, PTH, and bone mineral status (baseline); if vitamin D supplement is required, repeat 25(OH)D levels at 3-month intervals until normal. PTH and bone mineral status should be monitored every 6 months until normal (Wagner 2008).\n【99】 CKD: Measure serum 25(OH)D levels after 3 months of treatment. Measure corrected total calcium and phosphorous after 1 month and then at least every 3 months (KDOQI 2009).\n【100】 <12 ng/mL (30 nmol/L): At risk for deficiency (IOM 2011).\n【101】 12 to 20 ng/mL (30 to 50 nmol/L): Potentially at risk for inadequacy (IOM 2011).\n【102】 ≥20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L): Sufficient levels in practically all persons (IOM 2011).\n【103】 >40 ng/mL (100 nmol/L): Increased risk of falls have been reported in elderly females with levels >40 ng/mL (Smith 2017) or ~48 ng/mL (120 nmol/mL) (Sanders 2010).\n【104】 >50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L): There are insufficient data to determine the safe upper limit of serum 25(OH)D. Serum 25(OH)D levels above approximately 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L) should be avoided (IOM 2011).\n【105】 Osteoporosis patients: Recommended level to reach and maintain may vary by guideline/organization: ≥20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L) is considered adequate according to some experts (ES [Eastell 2019]); others suggest a goal of ~30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L) (NOF [Cosman 2014]).\n【106】 Children (Misra 2008):\n【107】 <15 ng/mL (37.5 nmol/L): At risk for deficiency.\n【108】 15 to 20 ng/mL (37.5 to 50 nmol/L): Potentially at risk for inadequacy.\n【109】 ≥20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L): Sufficient levels in practically all children.\n【110】 >100 ng/mL (250 nmol/L): Concern for risk of toxicity.\n【111】 Mechanism of Action\n【112】 Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is a provitamin. The active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol), stimulates calcium and phosphate absorption from the small intestine, promotes secretion of calcium from bone to blood; promotes renal tubule phosphate resorption.\n【113】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【114】 Onset of action: 10 to 24 hours; Maximum effect: ~1 month following daily doses\n【115】 Absorption: Absorbed in the small intestine; fat soluble; requires bile (IOM 2011)\n【116】 Metabolism: Inactive until hydroxylated hepatically to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D; calcifediol] then renally to the active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)\n【117】 Half-life, circulating: 25(OH)D: 2 to 3 weeks; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ~4 hours\n【118】 Excretion: Feces (IOM 2011)\n【119】 Brand Names: International\n【120】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol)  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/vitamin-d2-ergocalciferol-drug-information?search=%E6%89%8B%E6%9C%AF%E5%90%8E%E5%90%B8%E6%94%B6%E9%9A%9C%E7%A2%8D%E6%80%A7%E9%AA%A8%E8%B4%A8%E7%96%8F%E6%9D%BE&source=search_result&selectedTitle=111%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:21:57"}

Clinically mild illnesses due to SFG rickettsia are commonly mistaken for an undifferentiated viral illness, and confirmation of suspected SFG infections is often not obtained because of lack of access to or use of diagnostic testing modalities .\n【3】 Since millions of people now travel annually between continents and countries, physicians who practice in areas far removed from the site of primary infection may face returning travelers with unusual or unfamiliar clinical illnesses that are due to SFG rickettsiae . This topic will review the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnostic methods, and treatment of infections due to select, clinically relevant SFG organisms other than Rickettsia rickettsii. Infection caused by R. rickettsii (Rocky Mountain spotted fever) and typhus group rickettsia are discussed separately.   \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever\" and  \"Murine typhus\" and  \"Epidemic typhus\" and  \"Scrub typhus\".)\n【4】 TAXONOMY — Several human spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae have been identified in the past 16 years:\n【5】 Only about half of the known species of SFG rickettsiae cause human disease, while the remaining organisms are likely nonpathogenic parasites of arthropods. However, it is likely that some \"nonpathogenic\" SFG rickettsiae will eventually be found to cause disease in humans. As an example, R. montanensis, which has long been considered a nonpathogenic SFG rickettsiae, was subsequently implicated as the cause of mild illness in humans .\n【6】 Discovery and sequencing of new species results in periodic calls to modernize the taxonomic schema . The discussion of SFG rickettsiae that follows is based upon consensus taxonomic schema , but it is likely that the present nomenclature will change as advances in molecular biology occur, new organisms are discovered, and new isolates of known SFG rickettsiae are made from humans and arthropods.\n【7】 PATHOGENESIS — The literature on SFG rickettsiae is often confusing because clinical manifestations of illness due to one species may vary from region to region and host to host . Thus, one patient with Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) may have a mild disease while another may have severe, or even fatal, illness.\n【8】 The determinants of these variations in virulence remain poorly understood . Animal models suggest that dendritic cells may play an important role in augmentation of an adaptive Th1 cellular immune response against rickettsial infection . Dendritic cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines that lead to natural killer (NK) cell activation and proliferation; expansion of this cellular compartment correlated with protection from lethal rickettsial challenge in a murine model.\n【9】 The basic biology and pathogenesis of R. rickettsii, which share many elements with other rickettsiae, are discussed in detail elsewhere.   \"Biology of Rickettsia rickettsii infection\".)\n【10】 SPECIFIC INFECTIONS — The SFG rickettsial diseases are transmitted by ticks with two major exceptions: rickettsialpox is transmitted by mites, and R. felis is transmitted by cat fleas and occasionally by mosquitos .\n【11】 Clinically, there are enough similarities among the diseases caused by SFG rickettsiae that certain clinical and epidemiologic features should suggest their presence. These include:\n【12】 This section will provide a detailed discussion of specific infections caused by SFG rickettsia (listed alphabetically by organism).\n【13】 R. africae (African tick bite fever) — Although recognized as a distinct clinical illness in the 1930s and shown to be caused by a unique SFG rickettsiae , African tick bite fever (ATBF) was later erroneously attributed to R. conorii infection . Almost 60 years later, an isolate of a SFG rickettsiae was made from Amblyomma hebraeum ticks in Zimbabwe . This isolate was shown to be genotypically distinct from R. conorii and was named R. africae. Subsequently, identical isolations have been made from humans. This organism is now assumed to be the same organism isolated decades earlier.\n【14】 Rural Africans in endemic areas are commonly infected with R. africae. An outbreak in 13 French participants in an adventure race in South Africa illustrated that travelers to endemic regions can easily acquire infection . This infection may be fairly common in returning travelers from Africa . As an example, in another series of 120 travelers with tick bite-related disease, 117 of whom had traveled to Africa, all but one of the patients had R. africae infection . ATBF is also endemic to the eastern Caribbean .\n【15】 R. akari (Rickettsialpox) — Rickettsialpox was first described in New York City, but cases have also been reported from the Ukraine, Korea, and Slovenia . Rickettsialpox is caused by Rickettsia akari and is transmitted by the bite of the house mouse mite (Liponyssoides sanguineous). Humans are typically bitten by mouse mites after mouse extermination programs result in starving mites that seek alternative sources for a blood meal. The principal reservoir of R. akari is the house mouse, but transovarial infection by R. akari occurs in infected mites; thus, mites may be considered both the vector and a reservoir of rickettsialpox.\n【16】 Seven to 10 days after a mite bite, a painless red papule typically appears at the site of the inoculation. Fever characteristically begins 24 hours or less before the development of rash. This pattern was observed in 100 percent of 13 patients in one small series . The inoculation papule typically becomes vesicular over the next several days and eventually crusts, producing an eschar. Eschars may be small and overlooked unless the skin is examined with care . Regional lymphadenopathy often accompanies the inoculation lesion.\n【17】 Patients typically develop fever, chills, myalgia, and headache at the same time as an inoculation papule or early eschar appears. A generalized rash can occur simultaneously with the primary inoculation lesion or follow its appearance by several days. This rash is typically maculopapular, but individual lesions frequently become vesicular. In cases in which a vesicular rash is prominent, a misdiagnosis of varicella may be made. Vesicular lesions normally develop crusts as they heal, but these lesions, unlike chickenpox, do not produce scars. Rickettsialpox is usually a mild self-limiting illness even without treatment, but symptoms may last three weeks if treatment is not administered early in the course of illness.\n【18】 R. amblyommii infection — There are preliminary and still inconclusive data that suggest R. amblyommii may produce a mild infection in humans. This organism is commonly found in Ambylomma americanum ticks in the Piedmont area of the southeastern United States .\n【19】 R. australis (Queensland tick typhus) — Queensland tick typhus (QTT) is caused by Rickettsia australis and occurs along the entire east coast of Australia . QTT is typically a mild disease, although fatal cases have been reported, and a small percentage of patients may require care in intensive care units and have severe long-term complications . QTT is primarily transmitted by the scrub tick (lxodes holocyclus) and the organism circulates in nature between ticks, rodents, and small marsupials. As in other SFG rickettsial infections, man is only incidentally infected.\n【20】 An eschar occurs in one-half to two-thirds of infected patients at the site of the tick bite. Regional lymphadenopathy often occurs in adjacent nodal regions. The skin rash in patients with QTT may be maculopapular, petechial, or vesicular. When a vesicular rash is present, the illness may be confused with chickenpox, which, as noted above, can also occur with rickettsialpox or MSF.\n【21】 R. conorii (Mediterranean spotted fever) — Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF), also known as boutonneuse fever, is caused by R. conorii. R. conorii infection occurs in countries and regions adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea as well as in sub-Saharan Africa, Greece, India, and in areas around the Black Sea, such as Turkey, Bulgaria, and Ukraine. Sporadic cases have been described in non-endemic regions either in travelers or in patients who had contact with dogs infected from endemic areas.\n【22】 Similar to Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF), the onset of MSF is typically abrupt. Almost all patients have fever, headache, and a rash. In two large series of MSF from Southern Europe, rash was present in 97 and 99 percent of patients, respectively . However, the rash is often absent during the first few days of illness as in other rickettsial diseases. The rash is most often maculopapular but is petechial in approximately 10 percent of cases .\n【23】 Unlike RMSF, many patients with MSF have an eschar or black necrotic scabbed lesion (tache noire) at the site of the inoculating tick bite; in two large series, a tache noire was present in approximately 70 percent of patients . Rarely, multiple eschars are present . A papulovesicular or vesicular rash is uncommon in patients with MSF, but when vesicles occur, the illness may be mistaken for varicella.\n【24】 MSF may follow a less severe clinical course than RMSF. In a review of 199 documented cases, for example, there were only three deaths . However, the number of admissions for MSF tripled from 1994 to 2004 in Portugal. In a prospective study of risk factors associated with mortality among 140 hospitalized Portuguese patients with documented MSF, death occurred in 21 percent of patients. Patients who were infected with the Israel spotted fever strain (also known as R. conorii israelensis) had significantly higher case fatality ratios than patients infected with the Malish strain (ie, 29 versus 9 percent, respectively) . Patients with severe infections may have neurologic, cardiac, ocular, or renal complications. The hemophagocytic syndrome has also been described in patients infected with R. conorii .\n【25】 R. felis infection (flea rickettsiosis) — Cases of human infection with R. felis have been documented in patients on every continent except Antarctica, with most reports coming from Mexico, South America, the Caribbean Islands, and Africa . In some tropical regions of Africa and Asia, the infection may be more common than previously thought, and there is increasing evidence of widespread presence of this pathogen in arthropod and animal species throughout the globe .\n【26】 The first human patient recognized with R. felis infection had a clinical illness nearly identical to that typically seen with murine typhus due to Rickettsia typhi . As a result, when R. felis was first isolated, it was placed in the murine typhus group; however, this organism has subsequently been categorized in the spotted fever group even though it is a flea-borne pathogen.\n【27】 The difficulty in distinguishing this species from R. typhi is complicated, since R. felis antibodies cannot be distinguished from R. typhi antibodies using the immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test. In cases in which R. felis infection is suspected (eg, individuals with suspected or known contact with fleas from opossums or cats), it is possible to distinguish between the two pathogens using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that is available in a few research centers.  'Diagnosis' below.)\n【28】 Humans infected with R. felis typically have fever, headache, myalgias, and a macular rash. However, the small number of cases reported thus far limits our understanding of the clinical spectrum of illness.\n【29】 R. honei (Flinders Island spotted fever) — Flinders Island spotted fever was first recognized by an Australian general practitioner in the 1980s in patients living on a remote island in the Bass Straits between Tasmania and the Australian mainland . The causative agent, R. honei, is genotypically distinct from the agent of QTT (R. australis), although the clinical manifestations of the diseases produced by the two organisms are almost indistinguishable . Some cases of Flinders Island spotted fever have been caused by a strain that is genetically related to R. honei and has been designated the marmionii strain of R. honei .\n【30】 Flinders Island spotted fever is usually a mild disease. Approximately one-fourth of patients have a necrotic inoculation lesion, one-half have localized lymphadenopathy, and virtually all patients have fever, headache, and myalgias. Skin rash is usually maculopapular but rarely may be petechial.\n【31】 R. japonica (Japanese spotted fever) — First described in 1984, Japanese spotted fever (JSF) has been confined mainly to southwest Japan and Korea , with one reported case in Thailand . Several species of Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, and lxodes ticks have been shown to transmit R. japonica .\n【32】 JSF is caused by R. japonica and produces an illness very similar to Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF). In a review of 31 cases diagnosed at one hospital during a 12-year period, the following clinical features were noted :\n【33】 Recent reports describing fatal infection due to R. japonica have appeared .\n【34】 R. parkeri infection — R. parkeri was first isolated from Gulf Coast ticks (Amblyomma maculatum) in the southern United States in 1937. In 2004, the first human infection was confirmed, followed by scattered case reports from Virginia, Brazil, and Uruguay . A. maculatum ticks are also common in Central America, and human infections have been reported in Mexico and in a traveler returning from Honduras .\n【35】 The largest case series to date examined clinical specimens from patients in the United States who had a history of an eschar or vesicular rash and resided within the range of A. maculatum (ie, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennes . Laboratory diagnostic methods included at least one or more of the following: indirect immunofluorescence assays, histology, immunohistochemistry, cell culture (ie, Vero cells), and/or polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Six confirmed and six probable cases of R. parkeri rickettsiosis were identified from patients with possible rickettsial illness who were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1998 to 2007. The majority of the patients became ill between late July and early September. Seven of 12 reported a history of a tick bite with resultant eschar formation.\n【36】 Another five cases were subsequently identified at a single site in Georgia from 2012 to 2014, four of which were PCR-positive for R. parkeri in eschar biopsy samples using polymerase chain reaction testing . There are also emerging data of infection well outside the traditional range of A. maculatum, as evidenced by a description of R. parkeri cases in southern Arizona in 2016 .\n【37】 Eschars were described as crusted, nonpruritic, nontender or mildly tender, 0.5 to 2 cm in diameter, surrounded by an indurated, erythematous halo, and occasionally by a few scattered petechiae. Two patients had multiple eschars. A maculopapular or vesiculopapular exanthem, involving primarily the trunk and extremities, was identified in 10 patients within 0.5 to 4 days after the onset of fever .\n【38】 Low to moderate fever, myalgias, arthralgias, and headache were also common. Laboratory abnormalities included mild elevations of aminotransferases and mild thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.\n【39】 Although documented infection is rare, it is possible that cases are misdiagnosed because of the lack of use of stringent identification techniques . Antibodies generated to antigens of R. parkeri can react with R. rickettsii, R. akari, and other SFGR infections. Not only does this lead to diagnostic uncertainty, but epidemiologic trends of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF) may be clouded by a blending of other less severe rickettsial diseases.\n【40】 R. philipii ('Rickettsia 364D') — Confirmed cases of human illness caused by the rickettsial species R. philipii (sometimes called \"Pacific Coast Tick Fever\"), have been reported in California . This species had been described previously, but was not known to cause human illness. The organism is thought to be transmitted by Dermacentor occidentalis ticks. Most cases have been reported in children or the elderly, and have presented as a mild illness characterized by eschar formation, mild headache, malaise, lymphadenopathy, and low-grade fevers. This milder disease, along with the prevalence of R. philipii in D. occidentalis ticks in California (reported as high as 7 percent), suggest this illness may be more common than is recognized.\n【41】 R. sibirica infection\n【42】 Siberian tick typhus — Siberian tick typhus, caused by R. sibirica, was first recognized in Siberia during the 1930s. R. sibirica infection is now known to occur throughout much of northern and central Asia from Pakistan to northern China. Acute infection was reported in 4 of 13 paleontologists during an expedition to Mongolia; only two of the four recognized that they had been bitten by a tick .\n【43】 Similar to R. rickettsii infection, patients with Siberian tick typhus typically develop rash, fever, and headache four to seven days after a tick bite. R. sibirica infection commonly causes an eschar at the inoculation site of the infecting tick bite and is rarely associated with serious complications or death, even if untreated. These characteristics are similar to R. conorii infection, but not RMSF. Patients frequently have regional lymphadenopathy near the site of their ulcerated or necrotic inoculation lesion. Skin rash, which may be maculopapular, petechial, or purpuric, typically appears two to four days after the onset of fever and other systemic symptoms.\n【44】 Rickettsia heilongjangensis infection — Far-Eastern spotted fever (FESF) caused by R. heilongjangensis produces an illness similar to Siberian tick typhus in the Russian Far East and China. Illness due to this pathogen was distinguished from illness due to R. siberica using molecular methods, and is most common in endemic regions during the late summer .\n【45】 R. sibirica subspecies mongolotimonae — R. sibirica subspecies mongolotimonae was first isolated from a tick in Inner Mongolia in 1991 . Most of the recognized cases of infection with R. sibirica subspecies mongolitimonae have occurred in patients from southern France. However, cases have also been reported from Greece, Portugal, and South Africa . Illness due to this pathogen has been called \"lymphangitis-associated rickettsiosis\" because it frequently presents with enlarged regional lymph nodes or lymphangitis. In addition to lymphadenopathy and/or lymphangitis, clinical manifestations often include fever, maculopapular rash, and one or more inoculation eschars . Some patients may develop severe illness with complications such as acute renal failure, retinal vasculitis, and mental status changes. However, no fatalities have been reported.\n【46】 R. slovaca infection — Infection with R. slovaca results in a syndrome that was initially called Tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA) or Dermacentor-borne necrosis-eschar-lymphadenopathy (DEBONEL). Subsequently, the acronym SENLAT (scalp eschars and neck lymphadenopathy) has been proposed . Infection with R. slovaca is common in the early spring and fall in a number of European countries, including France, Slovakia, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Spain, and Poland . As an example, one report described 17 cases of R. slovaca infection from Hungary and France . All patients had crusted scalp lesions at the site of a tick bite that were associated with occipital and/or cervical lymphadenopathy. Lymphadenopathy was painful in the majority of cases. Several patients also developed alopecia at the site of the tick bite after the local crusted lesion resolved. Fever and generalized skin rash were rare. For some, alopecia and/or asthenia persisted even after treatment. The propensity of skin lesions and tick bites to occur on the scalp has been reported by other investigators as well .\n【47】 DIAGNOSIS — As with patients with Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF), the diagnosis of other SFG rickettsial infections is usually based upon clinical features and epidemiologic clues\n【48】 Confirmation of a clinical diagnosis can be achieved in four basic ways, as described below:\n【49】 The combined use of real-time quantitative PCR testing (qPCR) and serology may be the best diagnostic approach as the former modality is able to detect early infections before antibodies appear, whereas the serology is better able to confirm infection two weeks or more after onset of illness .\n【50】 Serology — Serologic detection of convalescent antibodies is the mainstay of diagnosis of SFG rickettsial infection. The following serologic tests can be used:\n【51】 Results from single-time point acute serologic samples drawn within the first week of illness should not be considered definitive evidence of the presence or absence of active disease. MIF antibody test, ELISA, IFA, and Western blot immunoassay methods do not detect convalescent IgM and IgG antibodies until 10 to 14 days after the onset of illness, and once they develop, low-moderate IgG antibody titers can persist for many years. This is similar to serologic assays used for the diagnosis of RMSF, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis.   \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Rocky Mountain spotted fever\" and  \"Human ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis\".)\n【52】 Serologic cross-reactions commonly occur among SFG species, and none of the methods listed above can reliably distinguish between species of SFG rickettsiae. A modification of the ELISA test, utilizing epitope saturation by specific monoclonal antibodies, has been developed to serologically confirm the specific species of infective rickettsiae ; however, this is not available clinically.\n【53】 Immunologic detection of rickettsia in tissue — Biopsies of skin rash, an eschar, or other tissues can be useful in the diagnosis of all SFG rickettsiae. However, such biopsies are rarely performed because specialized laboratory facilities needed to stain and process such tissues are not commonly available in areas where these diseases are endemic. Samples of tissue can be examined fresh (by frozen section) or after fixation in paraffin embedding. The tache noire lesion present in many SFG infections often contains large numbers of rickettsiae. Tissues can be stained with fluorescent-tagged conjugates or by immunoperoxidase staining.\n【54】 PCR-based detection of rickettsia — Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from blood, skin biopsy samples, and other tissues can be performed for detection of rickettsial DNA. Due to the pathophysiology of rickettsial infections, PCR of tissue samples typically offers much higher sensitivity than PCR of whole blood. Detection of rickettsial DNA is commonly based upon recognition of sequences within the genes encoding 16S rRNA, a 17 kDa protein, citrate synthase (gltA), or ompA/B . PCR testing is less useful after the onset of antimicrobial therapy and in late stages of illness.\n【55】 One technique called \"suicide PCR\" uses primers from rickettsial genes in the genomes of R. conorii and Rickettsia prowazekii and is able to detect rickettsiae in skin biopsy specimens from patients with a variety of spotted fever group rickettsioses. In one report, this technique was able to detect rickettsial DNA in skin biopsy specimens from patients with R. conorii, R. africae, and R. sibirica infections . Using a large cohort of patients with infection and corresponding controls, the estimated sensitivity and specificity were 68 and 100 percent, respectively. Suicide PCR was estimated to be 2.2 times more sensitive than culture and 1.5 times more sensitive than regular PCR techniques.\n【56】 At present, quantitative real-time PCR methods are rarely used outside of research centers. However, PCR and culture (usually of eschars or crusts overlying eschars) are typically the most accurate way to make species-specific diagnoses .\n【57】 Isolation of rickettsiae — Individual species of SFG rickettsiae can be isolated following inoculation into animals, such as guinea pigs, rats, or moles, or into embryonated eggs. Cell culture methods, including shell vial assay with early antigen detection by immunofluorescence, can also identify rickettsiae within 48 to 72 hours . All isolation methods require specialized laboratory facilities with appropriate safety systems designed to prevent laboratory acquisition of human infection. Such facilities and specialized reagents are available in only a few research centers; thus, isolation of rickettsiae is rare in clinical practice.\n【58】 TREATMENT\n【59】 Overview — We treat symptomatic patients with spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsial infections to reduce the duration of symptoms and prevent complications. Antimicrobial therapy should not be delayed while awaiting diagnostic testing in a patient with appropriate epidemiology and a compatible syndrome .\n【60】 Most patients can be treated with oral therapy as an outpatient, especially if the illness is detected and treated within five days of symptom onset. Antibiotics should generally be administered for five to seven days, although precise guidelines on the duration of treatment are not available. Support of cardiac, renal, and pulmonary systems may be necessary for those with severe disease.\n【61】 Doxycycline as preferred agent\n【62】 Adults — The dose of doxycycline for the treatment of SFG rickettsial infections is 100 mg twice daily administered orally or intravenously. Doxycycline should be used for both pregnant and nonpregnant patients. A more detailed discussion of the treatment of pregnant women is found below.  'Pregnant women' below.)\n【63】 Children — The dose of doxycycline for children who weigh ≤45 kg is 2.2 mg/kg twice per day (maximum daily dose 200 mg) . Children who weigh >45 kg should receive 100 mg twice daily. Tetracyclines can cause dental staining when administered to children younger than eight years. However, the risk of dental staining with doxycycline is minimal if a short course is administered .\n【64】 Alternative regimens — Alternative agents to doxycycline for those with a history of hypersensitivity or hepatotoxicity depend upon the severity of disease (eg, mild versus severe). Special considerations in pregnant women are described below.  'Pregnant women' below.)\n【65】 Fluoroquinolones are typically not recommended for the treatment of SFG rickettsial diseases. Although these agents had been considered a possible alternative to tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones were less effective than standard agents in patients with Mediterranean spotted fever . They were also associated with deleterious outcomes in patients infected with R. conorii in a cell culture model . In addition, certain rickettsiae (eg, Orientia tsutsugamushi) contain genes that encode known quinolone resistance factors .\n【66】 Mild disease — Azithromycin can be used as an alternative agent for individuals with mild disease (eg, mild headache, fever, myalgias), which is not due to R. rickettsii. The treatment of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever is discussed separately.   \"Treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever\".)\n【67】 For adults, the dose is 500 mg daily; for children, the dose of azithromycin is 10 mg/kg orally once daily (maximum dose 500 mg daily) . Although macrolides are not typically used for the treatment of rickettsial infections, they have shown efficacy in the treatment of children with Mediterranean spotted fever .\n【68】 Severe disease — Chloramphenicol is reserved as an alternative inpatient treatment for severe rickettsial infections (eg, severe headache, hypotension, shortness of breath, neurologic manifestations). Chloramphenicol is dosed as 50 mg/kg per day intravenously in four divided doses (maximum dose 4 grams per day); dose reductions are required if used to treat neonates .\n【69】 However, chloramphenicol can be difficult to rapidly obtain, and therefore, may not be a feasible option. There is also a low risk (1 in 25,000 to 40,000) of fatal aplastic anemia with chloramphenicol, and as a result, systemic use is restricted in many countries. A more detailed discussion of chloramphenicol is found elsewhere.   \"Treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever\", section on 'Choice of antibiotic' and  \"Treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever\", section on 'Drug toxicity'.)\n【70】 Pregnant women — Doxycycline (100 mg twice daily) is the preferred treatment for pregnant women. Previously, chloramphenicol had been recommended for pregnant women with SFG rickettsial infections since tetracyclines have been generally contraindicated in pregnancy because of the risk of fetal bone and teeth malformations and hepatotoxicity in the mother . However, there are increasing published data on the relative safety of doxycycline compared with older tetracyclines in both pregnancy and in children . More detailed discussions of the use of doxycycline in pregnancy are found elsewhere.   \"Treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever\", section on 'Pregnant women' and  \"Tetracyclines\", section on 'Special populations'.)\n【71】 For pregnant women who cannot take doxycycline, chloramphenicol should be used as an alternative agent. Chloramphenicol is dosed as 50 mg/kg per day intravenously in four divided doses (maximum dose 4 grams per day). If chloramphenicol is administered during the third trimester of pregnancy, it can be associated with \"Gray baby syndrome\" in premature infants and newborns . \"Gray baby syndrome\" is characterized by cyanosis, abdominal distention, vasomotor collapse (often with irregular respiration), and death. The reaction appears to be associated with serum levels ≥50 mcg/mL . Additional information on chloramphenicol is found elsewhere.   \"Treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever\", section on 'Choice of antibiotic' and  \"Treatment of Rocky Mountain spotted fever\", section on 'Drug toxicity'.)\n【72】 We use azithromycin (500 mg daily for five to seven days) to treat pregnant women who are unable to take doxycycline or chloramphenicol; however, its efficacy in pregnant women has not been established. Although azithromycin has shown efficacy in children with Mediterranean spotted fever, there are no studies that have specifically evaluated azithromycin to treat SFG rickettsia in pregnancy. In addition, a review of approximately 100 pregnancies complicated by murine and scrub typhus found that azithromycin did not improve fetal/neonatal outcomes (eg, stillbirths, preterm births, low birth weight) .   \"Murine typhus\", section on 'Diagnosis' and  \"Scrub typhus\".)\n", "title": "Other spotted fever group rickettsial infections", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/other-spotted-fever-group-rickettsial-infections?search=%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84X%E6%9F%93%E8%89%B2%E4%BD%93%E6%95%B0%E9%87%8F%E5%BC%82%E5%B8%B8&source=search_result&selectedTitle=110%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:47:37"}

Functional dyspepsia often comes back over time. Doctors are not able to find a cause for functional dyspepsia in most people.\n【2】 This article discusses the symptoms, testing, and treatment options for people with functional dyspepsia. Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents is discussed separately.   \"\n【3】 More detailed information about dyspepsia is available by subscription.   \"Functional dyspepsia in adults\" and  \"Approach to the adult with dyspepsia\".)\n【4】 The most common symptoms of functional dyspepsia include:\n【5】 Upset stomach\n【6】 Discomfort or pain in the belly\n【7】 Bloating\n【8】 Feeling full quickly when eating\n【9】 Some people also have nausea, vomiting, a lack of appetite, or weight loss.\n【10】 When to seek help — If you have any of the following, call your doctor or nurse:\n【11】 Vomiting that will not stop\n【12】 Vomiting blood\n【13】 If you are losing weight or have no appetite\n【14】 Bloody or dark-colored, tarry bowel movements\n【15】 Pain or difficulty with swallowing\n【16】 It is usually not clear what causes functional dyspepsia. However, researchers have focused on several factors that may be involved.\n【17】 Motor or nerve problems — The process of digesting food involves a series of events involving the nerves and muscles of the digestive tract. Problems in this system can cause the stomach to empty more slowly than normal, causing nausea and vomiting, feeling full quickly when eating, or bloating. However, not everyone whose stomach empties slowly has functional dyspepsia.\n【18】 Pain sensitivity — The stomach normally stretches as we eat to hold more food. However, some people are sensitive to this stretching and feel pain. It is not clear why this happens.\n【19】 Infection — Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a bacterial infection of the stomach that can lead to inflammation (gastritis) or ulcers. There may be a relationship between infection with H. pylori and functional dyspepsia. However, not all people with H. pylori have functional dyspepsia.   \"\n【20】 Functional dyspepsia occasionally begins with acute gastroenteritis, usually due to a bacterial or viral infection. Dyspepsia can persist long after the infection subsides, perhaps caused by a change in the bacteria that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.\n【21】 Psychological and social factors — People with functional dyspepsia often have mood problems, like anxiety or depression. Treating the underlying depression or anxiety can improve symptoms of abdominal pain.\n【22】 To help determine if you might have a cause of symptoms different from functional dyspepsia, your doctor or nurse will ask you questions and perform a physical exam. Questions to think about before your visit include:\n【23】 Is the pain \"gnawing\" or worse when you are hungry?\n【24】 Is the pain worse when you move in certain ways or press on certain areas of the abdomen?\n【25】 Do you take medicines for pain, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve)? Do you have a history of ulcers?\n【26】 Do you also have heartburn (ascending burning sensation beneath the sternum (\"breastbone\")?\n【27】 Do you have intense pain in the upper right or middle of the abdomen? Does the pain shoot into your back or between the shoulder blades? Does this happen periodically, along with vomiting, sweating, or feeling restless?\n【28】 Have there been changes in your bowel movements (new constipation or diarrhea)?\n【29】 Have you recently unintentionally lost weight, vomited repeatedly, or had difficulty swallowing?\n【30】 Do you have a family history of stomach cancer?\n【31】 Testing recommendations — The best way to diagnose functional dyspepsia is not clear. Some experts recommend the following:\n【32】 If you are 60 or older or have serious symptoms, such as repeated vomiting, weight loss, or difficulty swallowing, you might need an upper endoscopy procedure. This is a test that allows your doctor to look inside your esophagus, stomach, and upper intestine.   \"\n【33】 If you are younger than 60 or you do not have serious symptoms or family history of stomach cancer, you might be offered other types of testing. This might include a breath, blood, or stool test for H. pylori.   \"\n【34】 If your symptoms do not get better within four to eight weeks or if you get worse, your doctor or nurse might recommend further testing, including upper endoscopy.\n【35】 Understand the condition — Being diagnosed with functional dyspepsia might be a relief to some people and a frustration to others. It is important to understand that your pain is not in your head. If you have questions or concerns about your symptoms or treatments that are offered, talk to your doctor or nurse honestly.\n【36】 If you have mood problems, such as anxiety or depression, your doctor or nurse might recommend that you . Dealing with emotional issues can help you to feel better, both physically and mentally.\n【37】 Diet — Some people feel less pain after making changes in what they eat. This might include:\n【38】 Avoiding fatty foods (which can slow the emptying of the stomach).\n【39】 Eating small, frequent meals. Instead of three large meals, eat five or six small meals.\n【40】 Avoiding foods that make you feel worse. However, do not stop eating whole food groups unless you talk to your doctor or nurse.\n【41】 Avoiding too much alcohol.\n【42】 If you have questions about what you should eat, talk to your doctor, nurse, or a dietitian.\n【43】 Acid-reducing medicines — Some people feel better after taking a medicine that reduces stomach acid. Examples include:\n【44】 Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are more likely than other types of acid reducers to improve pain. Example of PPIs include omeprazole (Prilosec), esomeprazole (Nexium), lansoprazole (Prevacid), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant), pantoprazole (Protonix), and rabeprazole (AcipHex).\n【45】 Histamine blockers might help some people. Examples include famotidine (Pepcid), cimetidine (Tagamet), and nizatidine (Axid).\n【46】 In 2020, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed another histamine blocker, ranitidine (brand name: Zantac), from the market. This happened after testing showed that some products were found to be contaminated with a substance that can increase a person's risk of cancer if consumed at high enough levels over time. This medication will no longer be available in stores or pharmacies. If you have this medication in your home, you should stop taking it and throw away any that is left over. Your health care provider can suggest another medication to help with your symptoms.\n【47】 Antacids are not usually helpful for people with functional dyspepsia. Examples of antacids include Tums, Maalox, and Mylanta.\n【48】 H. pylori treatment — If you are diagnosed with H. pylori and you have a stomach ulcer, treating the H. pylori can help to reduce symptoms of dyspepsia.   \"\n【49】 If you test positive for H. pylori, talk to your doctor or nurse to see if you should be treated. In functional dyspepsia, treating H. pylori sometimes helps to reduce symptoms.\n【50】 Pain medicines — Low doses of an antidepressant medicine might help to reduce symptoms, even if you are not depressed. One of the most commonly used antidepressants is called a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). It is not clear how TCAs work, but they seem to improve pain when taken at low doses. The dose of TCAs used to treat pain is usually much lower than that used to treat depression.\n【51】 TCAs commonly used for pain include amitriptyline and desipramine. In the beginning, many people who take TCAs feel tired; this is not always an undesirable side effect since it can help improve sleep when TCAs are taken in the evening. TCAs are generally started in low doses and increased gradually. It can take a few weeks to begin feeling better.\n【52】 Nonprescription pain medicines like aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve) are not usually helpful and can actually worsen stomach upset.\n【53】 Prescription pain medicines, such as codeine, hydrocodone, or oxycodone, are not usually recommended long-term. These medicines have side effects (constipation) and are addictive.\n【54】 Complementary and alternative medicine — Several complementary and alternative medicine treatments are advertised to improve functional dyspepsia. Examples include treatments that include peppermint and caraway. However, there are no well performed medical studies of these treatments, so it is not clear if they are safe or if they work. For reliable information about complementary and alternative treatments, see the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health website.\n【55】 Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.\n【56】 The Basics — The Basics patient education pieces answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.\n【57】 Beyond the Basics — Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【58】 Professional level information — Professional level articles are designed to keep doctors and other health professionals up-to-date on the latest medical findings.

Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【238】 Vitamin K Antagonists (eg, warfarin): Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (Nonselective) may enhance the anticoagulant effect of Vitamin K Antagonists.  Management: Consider alternatives to this combination when possible. If the combination must be used, monitor coagulation status closely and advise patients to promptly report any evidence of bleeding or bruising. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【239】 Zanubrutinib: May enhance the antiplatelet effect of Agents with Antiplatelet Properties. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【240】 Dietary Considerations\n【241】 Oral: May be taken with food or milk to minimize GI irritation.\n【242】 Reproductive Considerations\n【243】 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may delay or prevent rupture of ovarian follicles. This may be associated with infertility that is reversible upon discontinuation of the medication. Consider discontinuing use in patients having difficulty conceiving or those undergoing investigation of fertility.\n【244】 Based on available information, NSAIDs can be continued in males with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who are planning to father a child (ACR [Sammaritano 2020]).\n【245】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【246】 The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) close to conception may be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage due to cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition interfering with implantation (Bermas 2014; Bloor 2013).\n【247】 Birth defects have been observed following in utero NSAID exposure in some studies; however, data are conflicting (Bloor 2013). Nonteratogenic effects, including prenatal constriction of the ductus arteriosus, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, oligohydramnios, necrotizing enterocolitis, renal dysfunction or failure, and intracranial hemorrhage have been observed in the fetus/neonate following in utero NSAID exposure (Bermas 2014; Bloor 2013). Maternal NSAID use may cause fetal renal dysfunction leading to oligohydramnios. Although rare, this may occur as early as 20 weeks' gestation and is more likely to occur with prolonged maternal use. Oligohydramnios may be reversible following discontinuation of the NSAID (Dathe 2019; FDA 2020). In addition, nonclosure of the ductus arteriosus postnatally may occur and be resistant to medical management (Bermas 2014; Bloor 2013).\n【248】 Maternal use of NSAIDs should be avoided beginning at 20 weeks' gestation. If NSAID use is necessary between 20 and 30 weeks' gestation, limit use to the lowest effective dose and shortest duration possible; consider ultrasound monitoring of amniotic fluid if treatment extends beyond 48 hours and discontinue the NSAID if oligohydramnios is found (FDA 2020). Because NSAIDs may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus, product labeling for meloxicam specifically states use should be avoided starting at 30 weeks' gestation.\n【249】 Based on available information, NSAIDs can be continued during the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases; use in the third trimester is not recommended (ACR [Sammaritano 2020]).\n【250】 Monitoring Parameters\n【251】 CBC and chemistry profile; occult blood loss and periodic liver function tests; renal function (urine output, serum BUN and creatinine); signs or symptoms of GI bleeding; blood pressure; periodic ophthalmologic exam with long-term therapy.\n【252】 Mechanism of Action\n【253】 Reversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and 2 (COX-1 and 2) enzymes, which results in decreased formation of prostaglandin precursors; has antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties\n【254】 Other proposed mechanisms not fully elucidated (and possibly contributing to the anti-inflammatory effect to varying degrees), include inhibiting chemotaxis, altering lymphocyte activity, inhibiting neutrophil aggregation/activation, and decreasing proinflammatory cytokine levels.\n【255】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【256】 Distribution:\n【257】 Children 2 to 6 years (n=7): Oral: Apparent Vd: Mean: 0.19 L/kg (Burgos-Vargas 2004).\n【258】 Children and Adolescents 7 to 16 years (n=11): Oral: Apparent Vd: Mean: 0.13 L/kg (Burgos-Vargas 2004).\n【259】 Adults: IV: Vz: 9.63 L; Oral: Vdss~10 L.\n【260】 Protein binding: ~99%, primarily to albumin; Note: Free fraction was higher in adult patients with renal failure who were receiving chronic dialysis.\n【261】 Metabolism: Hepatic via CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (minor); forms 4 metabolites (inactive).\n【262】 Bioavailability: 89% (capsule).\n【263】 Half-life elimination:\n【264】 Children 2 to 6 years (n=7): Oral: Mean: 13.4 hours (Burgos-Vargas 2004).\n【265】 Children and Adolescents 7 to 16 years (n=11): Oral: Mean: 12.7 hours (Burgos-Vargas 2004).\n【266】 Adults: IV: ~24 hours; Oral: ~15 to 22 hours.\n【267】 Time to peak:\n【268】 IV: 0.12 ± 0.04 hours.\n【269】 Oral: Initial: Within 2 hours (capsule); 4 to 5 hours (tablet); 4 to 12 hours (orally disintegrating tablet; prolonged with food); ~7 hours (suspension; following a high-fat meal [75 g of fat]); Secondary: ~8 hours (capsule); 12 to 14 hours (tablet).\n【270】 Excretion: Urine (predominantly as inactive metabolites; <1% unchanged drug); feces (predominantly as inactive metabolites; 1.6% as unchanged drug).\n【271】 Clearance: Oral:\n【272】 Children 2 to 6 years (n=7): Mean: 0.17 mL/minute/kg (Burgos-Vargas 2004).\n【273】 Children and Adolescents 7 to 16 years (n=11): Mean: 0.12 mL/minute/kg (Burgos-Vargas 2004).\n【274】 Adults: 7 to 9 mL/minute.\n【275】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【276】 Altered kidney function:\n【277】 IV: Cmax and AUC increased 5% and 7%, respectively, in elderly subjects with mild renal impairment (eGFR 60 to 90 mL/minute/1.73 m2) compared to young healthy controls.\n【278】 Oral: Meloxicam plasma concentration is decreased and total clearance increased in patients with renal impairment.\n【279】 Brand Names: International\n【280】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Meloxicam  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/meloxicam-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E6%96%B0%E7%94%9F%E5%84%BF%E5%9D%8F%E6%AD%BB%E6%80%A7%E5%B0%8F%E8%82%A0%E7%BB%93%E8%82%A0%E7%82%8E%EF%BC%8C1A%E6%9C%9F%E5%92%8C1B%E6%9C%9F&source=search_result&selectedTitle=66%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:39:59"}

It occurs more often in the winter months because people spend more time in close contact with one another. The flu is spread easily from person to person by coughing, sneezing, or touching surfaces.\n【2】 Every year, complications of the flu require more than 200,000 people in the United States to be hospitalized. Serious illness is more likely in the very young, older adults, pregnant women, and people who have certain health problems such as asthma or other forms of lung disease.\n【3】 There have been several widespread flu outbreaks (called pandemics), which led to the deaths of many people worldwide. These outbreaks occurred when new strains of influenza viruses formed (often from pigs or birds) and humans became infected because they had no immunity to these viruses.\n【4】 This article discusses the symptoms and treatment of seasonal, swine H1N1, and avian flu. Treatments to prevent the flu, including the flu shot, are discussed separately.   \"\n【5】 FLU SYMPTOMS — Symptoms of seasonal flu can vary from person to person but usually include:\n【6】 People with the flu usually have a fever for two to five days. This is different than fever caused by other upper respiratory viruses, which usually resolve after 24 to 48 hours.\n【7】 Most people with the flu have fever and muscle aches, and some people also have cold-like symptoms (runny nose, sore throat). Flu symptoms usually improve over two to five days, although the illness may last for a week or more. Weakness and fatigue may persist for several weeks .\n【8】 Flu complications — Complications of influenza occur in some people; pneumonia is the most common complication. Pneumonia is a serious infection of the lungs and is more likely to occur in young children, people over the age of 65, people who live in long-term care facilities (nursing homes), and those with other illnesses such as diabetes or conditions affecting the heart or lungs. Pneumonia is also more common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those who have had a transplant.   \"\n【9】 FLU DIAGNOSIS — Influenza is usually diagnosed based on symptoms (fever, cough, and muscle aches). Lab testing for influenza is performed in certain cases, such as during a new influenza outbreak in a community and in patients who are at increased risk for complications.\n【10】 FLU TREATMENT\n【11】 When to seek help — Most people with the flu recover within one to two weeks without treatment. However, serious complications of the flu can occur. Call your doctor or nurse immediately if:\n【12】 In children, you should seek help if the child has any of the above or if the child:\n【13】 There are several groups of people who are at increased risk for flu complications. These include pregnant women, young children (<5 years of age and especially <2 years of age), people ≥65 years of age, and people with certain diseases such as chronic lung disease (such as asthma), heart disease, diabetes, immunosuppressing conditions (such as human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] infection or transplantation), and some other diseases. If you or your child has flu symptoms and is at increased risk for flu complications, you should call your health care provider.\n【14】 Treat symptoms — Treating the symptoms of influenza can help you to feel better but will not make the flu go away faster.\n【15】 Antiviral treatment — Antiviral medicines can be used to treat or prevent influenza. When used as a treatment, the medicine does not eliminate flu symptoms, although it can reduce the severity and duration of symptoms by about one day. Not every person with influenza needs an antiviral medicine, but some people do; the decision is based upon several factors. If you are severely ill and/or have risk factors for developing complications of influenza, you will need an antiviral agent. People who are only mildly ill and have no risk factors for complications are usually treated with an antiviral medicine if they have had symptoms for 48 hours or less, but they are not treated if they have had symptoms for more than 48 hours.\n【16】 Antiviral medicines that are used to treat the flu include oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu), zanamivir (brand name: Relenza), peramivir (brand name: Rapivab), and baloxavir (brand name: Xofluza). Antiviral treatment is most effective for seasonal influenza when it is taken within the first 48 hours of flu symptoms.\n【17】 The best antiviral medicine depends upon the type of influenza virus, if the virus could be resistant, and some individual factors. A doctor or nurse should make this decision.   \"Seasonal influenza in adults: Role of antiviral prophylaxis for prevention\" and  \"Seasonal influenza in nonpregnant adults: Treatment\" and  \"Seasonal influenza in children: Management\".)\n【18】 Side effects — Zanamivir and oseltamivir can cause mild side effects, including nausea and vomiting; zanamivir, which is inhaled, can cause difficulty breathing in some cases. Diarrhea is the most common side effect of peramivir and baloxavir. Most people are able to continue the medicine despite the side effects.\n【19】 Antibiotics — Antibiotics are NOT useful for treating viral illnesses such as influenza. Antibiotics should only be used if there is a bacterial complication of the flu such as bacterial pneumonia, ear infection, or sinusitis. Antibiotics can cause side effects and lead to development of antibiotic resistance.\n【20】 Complementary and alternative treatments — There are a wide variety of herbal, homeopathic, and other complementary and alternative treatments that are marketed for influenza. Unfortunately, there have been few well-designed studies to evaluate their efficacy and safety.\n【21】 PREVENTING FLU — Treatments to prevent influenza are discussed separately.   \"\n【22】 SWINE H1N1 FLU — A new strain of H1N1 influenza, which contains parts of swine, avian, and human influenza viruses, was first seen in humans in March 2009 in Mexico. Human infections subsequently occurred around the world and caused a pandemic that continued until August 2010. The same strain of H1N1 influenza has since become one of the strains of seasonal influenza.\n【23】 Symptoms of infection with the swine H1N1 flu virus and treatment for it were generally similar to those of seasonal flu.\n【24】 AVIAN FLU — Avian influenza (bird flu) is caused by strains of influenza virus that originally infected birds. Infected birds include chickens, ducks, and geese, among others.\n【25】 There are several strains of avian flu; the H5N1 avian flu virus is the cause of concern since it has led to several deaths in people, mostly in Asia. Another type of avian flu that causes illness in people is called H7N9. To date, avian flu has primarily spread from bird to bird and much less commonly from bird to human; human-to-human transmission has occurred rarely. Most humans who became infected with avian flu had direct contact with sick or dead poultry or wild birds or had very recently visited a live poultry market. No human cases of avian influenza have been described in the United States or elsewhere in North America.\n【26】 Avian flu is frequently severe, and there is little natural immunity in the human population. At least one antiviral medicine (oseltamivir) might improve the chance of surviving the infection.  'Antiviral treatment' above.)\n【27】 There is a vaccine to prevent H5N1 avian flu. The vaccine is not commercially available but has been stockpiled by the United States government in case it is needed in the future.\n【28】 Updated information about avian influenza is available from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website.\n【29】 WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION — Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.\n【30】 The Basics — The Basics patient education pieces answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.\n【31】 Beyond the Basics — Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【32】 Professional level information — Professional level articles are designed to keep doctors and other health professionals up-to-date on the latest medical findings. These articles are thorough, long, and complex, and they contain multiple references to the research on which they are based. Professional level articles are best for people who are comfortable with a lot of medical terminology and who want to read the same materials their doctors are reading.\n", "title": "Patient education  Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/influenza-symptoms-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics?search=%E5%AF%B9%E8%8D%89%E8%8D%AF%E5%92%8C%E6%9B%BF%E4%BB%A3%E7%96%97%E6%B3%95%E7%9A%84%E8%B6%85%E6%95%8F%E5%8F%8D%E5%BA%94&source=search_result&selectedTitle=115%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:25:05"}

The incidence and severity was highest in patients receiving pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase with anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens. Evaluate cardiac function prior to and during pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase treatment. Discontinue pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase in patients receiving adjuvant therapy, and withhold pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase in patients with metastatic disease for clinically significant decrease in left ventricular function. Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase may cause left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias, hypertension, disabling cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy, and cardiac death. Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase may also result in an asymptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline. Patients who received IV pertuzumab, IV trastuzumab, and docetaxel experienced an increased incidence of LVEF decline. Among patients receiving trastuzumab, there is a 4- to 6-fold increase in the incidence of symptomatic myocardial dysfunction compared to patients not receiving trastuzumab. The highest absolute incidence occurs when trastuzumab is administered with an anthracycline. If an anthracycline-based regimen is indicated, pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase should not begin until after anthracycline therapy is completed. Patients who receive anthracycline after stopping pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase may also be at increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase and/or IV pertuzumab and trastuzumab have not been studied in patients with a pretreatment LVEF of <55% (in early breast cancer) or <50% (in metastatic breast cancer), a prior history of heart failure, conditions that could impair LVEF such as uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction (MI), serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring treatment, or a cumulative prior anthracycline exposure of >360 mg/m2 of doxorubicin (or equivalent). Conduct a thorough cardiac assessment, including history, physical examination, and LVEF assessment (by ECG or MUGA scan) prior to treatment initiation. Assess LVEF immediately prior to pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase initiation, every 3 months during pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase therapy, every 3 weeks if pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase is withheld for significant left ventricular cardiac dysfunction, and every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of adjuvant pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase therapy. Cardiotoxicity may require therapy interruption and/or permanent discontinuation.\n【60】 According to American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines for prevention and monitoring of cardiac dysfunction in adult survivors of cancer (ASCO [Armenian 2017]), the risk of cardiac dysfunction related to trastuzumab is increased with the following:\n【61】 - Trastuzumab alone AND any of the following risk factors: multiple cardiovascular risk factors (≥2 risk factors), including smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity (during or after completion of therapy), or older age (≥60 years of age) at cancer treatment, or compromised cardiac function (eg, borderline low LVEF [50% to 55%], history of MI, moderate or higher valvular heart disease) before or during treatment.\n【62】 - Treatment with lower-dose anthracycline (eg, doxorubicin <250 mg/m2, epirubicin <600 mg/m2) followed by trastuzumab (sequential therapy).\n【63】 Hypersensitivity: Severe administration-related reactions, including hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis, and fatal outcomes, have been reported with pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase. Patients with dyspnea at rest due to complications of advanced malignancy and/or comorbidities may be at increased risk of a severe or fatal adverse reaction. The most common administration-related reactions with pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase were injection-site reactions and injection-site pain. Serious and fatal reactions have been reported with IV trastuzumab products. Closely monitor for systemic hypersensitivity reactions, particularly with the initial dose (monitor for at least 30 minutes after initial dose and 15 minutes after maintenance doses). If a significant administration-related reaction occurs, slow down or pause the injection and initiate appropriate medical management. Permanently discontinue pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase in patients who experience anaphylaxis or severe administration-related reactions. Medications to treat anaphylaxis or hypersensitivity and emergency equipment should be available for immediate use. Consider premedication with an analgesic, antipyretic, or an antihistamine prior to subsequent pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase doses in patients who experienced a reversible grade 1 or 2 hypersensitivity reaction.\n【64】 Pulmonary toxicity: [US Boxed Warning]: Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase can result in serious and fatal pulmonary toxicity. Discontinue pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase for anaphylaxis, angioedema, interstitial pneumonitis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Monitor until symptoms completely resolve. Pulmonary toxicity reported with trastuzumab includes dyspnea, interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary infiltrates, pleural effusions, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, pulmonary insufficiency and hypoxia, ARDS, and pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with symptomatic intrinsic lung disease or extensive pulmonary tumor involvement, resulting in dyspnea at rest, appear to have more severe pulmonary toxicity.\n【65】 Chemotherapy: Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase may increase the incidence of neutropenia when used in combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The incidences of grades 3 and 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were higher in patients receiving IV trastuzumab (compared to those who received chemotherapy alone).\n【66】 Pregnancy: [US Boxed Warning]: Exposure to pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase during pregnancy can result in embryo-fetal death and birth defects. Advise patients of these risks and the need for effective contraception.\n【67】 Do not interchange: Pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase and conventional trastuzumab products, trastuzumab/hyaluronidase, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan, or pertuzumab are not interchangeable. Verify product label prior to reconstitution and administration to prevent medication errors. Dosing and treatment schedules differ between pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase and conventional trastuzumab (Herceptin or trastuzumab biosimilars), trastuzumab/hyaluronidase (Herceptin Hylecta), ado-trastuzumab emtansine (Kadcyla), fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan (Enhertu), or pertuzumab (Perjeta).\n【68】 Dosage Forms: US\n【69】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【70】 Solution, Subcutaneous [preservative free]:\n【71】 Phesgo: Pertuzumab 60 mg, trastuzumab 60 mg, and hyaluronidase-zzxf 2,000 units per mL (10 mL); Pertuzumab 80 mg, trastuzumab 40 mg, and hyaluronidase-zzxf 2,000 units per mL (15 mL)\n【72】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【73】 No\n【74】 Pricing: US\n【75】 60-60-2000MG-MG-U/ML (per mL): $1,016.52\n【76】 80-40-2000MG-MG-U/ML (per mL): $1,016.56\n【77】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【78】 Solution, Subcutaneous:\n【79】 Phesgo: 60-60 MG/ML (10 mL); 80-40 MG/ML (15 mL)\n【80】 Administration: Adult\n【81】 Observe patients for at least 30 minutes after the initial pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase dose and 15 minutes after each maintenance dose (for signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity and/or administration-related reactions).\n【82】 If receiving in combination with docetaxel or paclitaxel, administer pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase first, followed by the taxane.\n【83】 Check label to ensure appropriate product is being administered; pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase, trastuzumab/hyaluronidase, conventional trastuzumab products, ado-trastuzumab emtansine, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan, and pertuzumab are different products and are NOT interchangeable.\n【84】 Hazardous Drugs Handling Considerations\n【85】 Pertuzumab is a hazardous agent (NIOSH 2016 [group 1]).\n【86】 Use appropriate precautions for receiving, handling, storage, preparation, dispensing, transporting, administration, and disposal. Follow NIOSH and USP 800 recommendations and institution-specific policies/procedures for appropriate containment strategy (NIOSH 2016; USP-NF 2020).\n【87】 Use: Labeled Indications\n【88】 Medication Safety Issues\n【89】 High alert medication:\n【90】 Administration issues:\n【91】 Other safety concerns:\n【92】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【93】 None known.\n【94】 Drug Interactions\n【95】 Alpha-/Beta-Agonists: Hyaluronidase may enhance the vasoconstricting effect of Alpha-/Beta-Agonists.  Management: Avoid the use of hyaluronidase to enhance dispersion or absorption of alpha-/beta-agonists.  Use of hyaluronidase for other purposes in patients receiving alpha-/beta-agonists may be considered as clinically indicated. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【96】 Anthracyclines: Trastuzumab may enhance the cardiotoxic effect of Anthracyclines.  Management: When possible, patients treated with trastuzumab should avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping trastuzumab.  Monitor closely for cardiac dysfunction in patients receiving anthracyclines with trastuzumab. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【97】 Antihistamines: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Hyaluronidase. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【98】 Corticosteroids (Systemic): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Hyaluronidase. Management: Patients receiving corticosteroids (particularly at larger doses) may not experience the desired clinical response to standard doses of hyaluronidase. Larger doses of hyaluronidase may be required. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【99】 DOPamine: Hyaluronidase may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of DOPamine.  Management: Avoid the use of hyaluronidase to enhance dispersion or absorption of dopamine.  Use of hyaluronidase for other purposes in patients receiving dopamine may be considered as clinically indicated. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【100】 Efgartigimod Alfa: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Fc Receptor-Binding Agents. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【101】 Estrogen Derivatives: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Hyaluronidase. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【102】 Local Anesthetics: Hyaluronidase may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Local Anesthetics.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【103】 Phenylephrine (Systemic): Hyaluronidase may enhance the vasoconstricting effect of Phenylephrine (Systemic).  Management: Avoid the use of hyaluronidase to enhance dispersion or absorption of phenylephrine.  Use of hyaluronidase for other purposes in patients receiving phenylephrine may be considered as clinically indicated. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【104】 Rozanolixizumab: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Fc Receptor-Binding Agents. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【105】 Salicylates: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Hyaluronidase. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【106】 Reproductive Considerations\n【107】 Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use in females of reproductive potential.\n【108】 Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during therapy and for 7 months after the last pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase dose.\n【109】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【110】 Data collection to monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase is ongoing. Healthcare providers are encouraged to enroll females exposed during pregnancy or within 7 months after the last pertuzumab/trastuzumab/hyaluronidase dose in the Pregnancy Registry (1-888-835-2555).\n【111】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【112】 It is not known if pertuzumab, trastuzumab, or hyaluronidase are present in breast milk.\n【113】 According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and the benefits of treatment to the mother. The long elimination half-life of pertuzumab and washout period of trastuzumab (7 months) should also be considered.\n【114】 Monitoring Parameters\n【115】 Assess for HER2 overexpression and HER2 gene amplification by validated immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methodology (pretherapy) specific for breast cancer. Evaluate pregnancy status prior to treatment initiation (in females of reproductive potential). Conduct a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment prior to treatment initiation, including a history and physical examination. Assess left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline and at regular intervals during therapy; if treatment is withheld for significant LVEF dysfunction, monitor LVEF at 3-week intervals. When used for adjuvant therapy, continue to monitor for cardiomyopathy and assess LVEF every 6 months for at least 2 years following completion of treatment. Monitor for signs/symptoms of cardiomyopathy and/or pulmonary toxicity. Monitor closely for at least 30 minutes after initial dose and 15 minutes after maintenance doses for signs/symptoms of hypersensitivity and/or administration-related reactions; if a reaction occurs, monitor carefully until symptoms resolve completely.\n【116】 The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B screening and management provisional clinical opinion (ASCO [Hwang 2020]) recommends hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.\n【117】 Mechanism of Action\n【118】 Pertuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular HER2 protein dimerization domain. It inhibits HER2 dimerization and blocks HER downstream, signaling halting cell growth and initiating apoptosis. Pertuzumab binds to a different HER2 epitope than trastuzumab so that when pertuzumab is combined with trastuzumab, a more complete inhibition of HER2 signaling occurs (Baselga 2012).\n【119】 Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of HER2; it mediates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity by inhibiting proliferation of cells that overexpress HER2 protein.\n【120】 Hyaluronidase increases the dispersion and absorption rate of SubQ trastuzumab-containing products by increasing permeability of SubQ tissue through temporary depolymerization of hyaluronan; at the recommended doses, hyaluronidase acts transiently and locally; permeability of the SubQ tissue is restored within 24 to 48 hours.\n【121】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【122】 Distribution: SubQ: Pertuzumab: 2.8 L; Trastuzumab: 2.9 L.\n【123】 Bioavailability: Absolute: SubQ: Pertuzumab: (0.7); Trastuzumab (0.8).\n【124】 Time to peak: SubQ: Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab: 4 days.\n【125】 Excretion: Clearance: Linear: SubQ: Pertuzumab: 0.2 L/day; Trastuzumab: 0.1 L/day.\n【126】 Brand Names: International\n【127】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and hyaluronidase  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/pertuzumab-trastuzumab-and-hyaluronidase-drug-information?search=%E7%82%8E%E6%80%A7%E4%B9%B3%E8%85%BA%E7%99%8C&source=search_result&selectedTitle=42%7E47&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:23:02"}

For the purpose of this topic review, we define early-onset as before 72 hours of age.\n【2】 Late-onset pneumonia – Late-onset pneumonia is generally defined as onset of symptoms at ≥72 hours of age.\n【3】 Early-onset pneumonia – Early-onset pneumonia (ie, before 72 hours of age) is acquired from the mother by one of three routes:\n【4】 Late-onset pneumonia – Late-onset pneumonia (ie, at ≥72 hours of age) can occur in two settings:\n【5】 Early-onset pneumonia – Risk factors associated with early-onset pneumonia are the same as those associated with early-onset sepsis and include :\n【6】 Late-onset pneumonia – Risk factors associated with late-onset pneumonia include :\n【7】 Bacterial pathogens – Group B streptococcus and Escherichia coli account for most cases of bacterial pneumonia in neonates . Other important bacterial pathogens include Klebsiella spp, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Chlamydia trachomatis . Gram-negative organisms (eg, Serratia, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter) are increasingly recognized, particularly in preterm neonates with late-onset pneumonia . Listeria monocytogenes and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are uncommon but important causes.\n【8】 Bacterial pathogens in early- and late-onset pneumonia are generally similar to those identified in early- and late-onset sepsis, as summarized in the table\n【9】 Some bacterial pathogens have characteristic features:\n【10】 One bacterial pathogen, Ureaplasma urealyticum, has been linked potentially to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. This is discussed separately.   \"Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma infections\", section on 'Neonatal disease' and  \"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD): Clinical features and diagnosis\", section on 'Infection'.)\n【11】 Viral pathogens – Viral lower respiratory tract infection in neonates can occur from:\n【12】 Important viral pathogens in the newborn include:\n【13】 Fungal pathogens – Candida spp and other fungal pathogens are important pathogens causing systemic infections in neonates, particularly in extremely low birth weight infants . Infants receiving prolonged antibiotic therapy and/or corticosteroids are at increased risk for invasive infection.   \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Candida infection in neonates\", section on 'Invasive infection'.)\n【14】 Other pathogens – Occasionally, early-onset pneumonia is\n【15】 Early-onset pneumonia – Early-onset pneumonia presents with findings that may include:\n【16】 These signs are not specific for pneumonia, and respiratory distress also can be caused by noninfectious causes\n【17】 Late-onset pneumonia – Late-onset pneumonia is heralded by changes in the overall condition of the newborn. Nonspecific signs may include:\n【18】 Cultures – Cultures of blood and cerebrospinal fluid should be obtained.   \"Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of sepsis in term and late preterm neonates\", section on 'Laboratory tests' and  \"Clinical features and diagnosis of bacterial sepsis in preterm infants <34 weeks gestation\", section on 'Symptomatic neonates'.)\n【19】 In infants who are intubated, Gram stain and culture of tracheal aspirates should be performed . In chronically ventilated patients, growth of bacteria from tracheal aspirate may represent true infection or colonization . In this setting, polymicrobial growth, low levels of growth, and/or growth of nonpathogenic bacteria are more suggestive of contamination or colonization rather than infection.   \"Tracheobronchitis associated with tracheostomy tubes and endotracheal intubation in children\", section on 'Culture'.)\n【20】 In patients with pleural effusions, if pleural fluid is sampled for therapeutic reasons, it can be sent for Gram stain and culture. It is generally unnecessary to perform pleural fluid sampling solely for the purpose of obtaining a culture.\n【21】 Viral testing – If a viral etiology is suspected, testing should include polymerase chain reaction testing (ie, respiratory viral panel) and viral cultures. If a congenital or perinatally acquired infection is suspected (eg, congenital cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus), appropriate viral testing should be performed, as described separately.   \"Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis\", section on 'Approach to testing' and  \"Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis\", section on 'Detection of HSV'.)\n【22】 Testing for C. trachomatis – If C. trachomatis infection is suspected (eg, if the neonate was born to a mother with a history of untreated C. trachomatis infection or no prenatal care), testing should be performed using a nucleic acid amplification test on a nasopharyngeal sample, as discussed separately.   \"Chlamydia trachomatis infections in the newborn\", section on 'Diagnosis'.)\n【23】 Fungal cultures – If there is clinical suspicion for invasive fungal infection (eg, preterm neonate receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics), it may be appropriate to obtain fungal cultures in addition to bacterial cultures. This is discussed separately.   \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Candida infection in neonates\", section on 'Invasive infections'.)\n【24】 Chest radiography – The chest radiograph is the main diagnostic test for confirming the diagnosis of pneumonia. Bilateral pulmonary opacities or focal infiltrates with air bronchograms are the characteristic findings . However, the radiographic findings are variable. Occasionally, the chest radiograph will be normal (eg, if obtained early in the course) . In addition, the appearance can overlap with other types of neonatal lung disease. For example, some neonates may have diffuse hazy opacities that appear similar to respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants . Others may have coarse irregular opacities similar to the appearance of meconium aspiration syndrome . The clinical context can generally distinguish between these diagnoses. In uncertain cases, the presence of pleural effusions can support the diagnosis of pneumonia since effusions are common in neonatal pneumonia and less common in respiratory distress syndrome or meconium aspiration syndrome .\n【25】 Lung ultrasound – In experienced hands, lung ultrasound has good sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing common neonatal respiratory diseases, including pneumonia . The characteristic ultrasound findings of pneumonia in neonates are hypoechoic areas of consolidation with irregular margins and air bronchograms . However, the diagnostic accuracy varies considerably depending on the experience and expertise of the operator. For this reason, lung ultrasound is not a routine part of the evaluation of neonates with suspected pneumonia.\n【26】 Disorders of transition (eg, transient tachypnea or the newborn, respiratory distress syndrome)   \"Overview of neonatal respiratory distress and disorders of transition\" and  \"Transient tachypnea of the newborn\")\n【27】 Meconium aspiration syndrome   \"Meconium aspiration syndrome: Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\")\n【28】 Pneumothorax   \"Pulmonary air leak in the newborn\", section on 'Pneumothorax')\n【29】 Congenital malformations (eg, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, congenital pulmonary airway malformation)   \"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia in the neonate\" and  \"Congenital pulmonary airway malformation\")\n【30】 Congenital heart disease (large ventricular septal defect, total anomalous pulmonary venous connection, patent ductus arteriosus, truncus arteriosus)   \"Identifying newborns with critical congenital heart disease\", section on 'Respiratory symptoms')\n【31】 Maintaining a neutral thermal environment\n【32】 Maintaining adequate oxygenation and perfusion   \"Respiratory support, oxygen delivery, and oxygen monitoring in the newborn\")\n【33】 Prevention of hypoglycemia and metabolic acidosis   \"Management and outcome of neonatal hypoglycemia\")\n【34】 Maintenance of normal fluid and electrolyte status   \"Fluid and electrolyte therapy in newborns\")\n【35】 Early-onset pneumonia – For early-onset pneumonia (ie, before 72 hours of age), we suggest initial empiric coverage with ampicillin and gentamicin. However, local antibiotic susceptibility patterns should also be considered. For example, in centers with a high prevalence of gentamicin resistance among gram-negative isolates, an alternative aminoglycoside (eg, amikacin) should be used .\n【36】 Dosing of ampicillin and gentamicin is based upon the infant's weight, renal function, postnatal age, and postmenstrual age . Refer to the drug monographs for details.\n【37】 Third-generation cephalosporins, although active against many gram-negative organisms, should generally not be used for suspected early-onset sepsis or pneumonia. Gram-negative bacilli can rapidly develop resistance to cephalosporins by either inducible or chromosomally mediated beta-lactamase activity . In addition, a large observational study found that the risk of death from early-onset sepsis was increased in neonates who received cefotaxime as initial empiric treatment compared with those who received gentamicin .\n【38】 Late-onset pneumonia – The choice of empiric therapy for late-onset pneumonia is influenced by the clinical setting (ie, whether the neonate has been hospitalized since birth or is presenting from the community) and local susceptibility patterns.\n【39】 For most infants ≥72 hours old, we suggest an empiric regimen that includes:\n【40】 Dosing of these medications is based upon the infant's weight, renal function, postnatal age, and postmenstrual age. Refer to the drug monographs for details. Once a specific organism is identified, therapy is modified according to the susceptibility pattern.  'Definitive therapy' below.)\n【41】 Group B streptococcus – Penicillin or ampicillin are the preferred agents for treatment of group B streptococcus, as summarized in the table\n【42】 E. coli – In patients with ampicillin-sensitive E. coli infections, ampicillin monotherapy is administered for definitive therapy.\n【43】 For patients with ampicillin-resistant E. coli, the choice of definitive therapy is based upon the susceptibility profile. An expanded-spectrum cephalosporin (eg, cefotaxime [where available], ceftazidime, or cefepime) is often employed if the isolate is susceptible or an appropriate aminoglycoside.\n【44】 Other gram-negative bacteria – Antimicrobial treatment of infections caused by Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Pseudomonas, or other gram-negatives should be selected based upon the susceptibility profile of the organism. Single-agent therapy is sufficient in most cases.\n【45】 Infections caused by multidrug-resistant, gram-negative bacilli, including those caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms or those with hyperproduction of beta-lactamases, should be treated with meropenem . Consultation with an infectious disease specialist is advised.\n【46】 S. aureus – Treatment of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus infection should be completed with nafcillin. Cefazolin is a reasonable alternative.   \"Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in children: Management and outcome\".)\n【47】 Treatment of methicillin-resistant S. aureus should be completed with vancomycin.   \"Staphylococcus aureus in children: Overview of treatment of invasive infections\", section on 'Treatment of neonates'.)\n【48】 C. trachomatis – Oral azithromycin is the preferred treatment for neonatal C. trachomatis infections, as discussed separately.   \"Chlamydia trachomatis infections in the newborn\", section on 'Treatment'.)\n【49】 L. monocytogenes – Treatment of L. monocytogenes infections in neonates is summarized in the table\n【50】 Herpes simplex virus – Treatment is according to the recommendations for disseminated disease   \"Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection: Management and prevention\", section on 'Initial antiviral therapy')\n【51】 Congenital cytomegalovirus   \"Congenital cytomegalovirus infection: Management and outcome\", section on 'Antiviral treatment')\n【52】 Respiratory syncytial virus and other viral lower respiratory tract infections   \"Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Treatment\" and  \"Bronchiolitis in infants and children: Treatment, outcome, and prevention\")\n【53】 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)   \"COVID-19: Intrapartum and postpartum issues\", section on 'Care of newborns of infected mothers')\n【54】 Incidence – Pneumonia is a major contributor to infant mortality worldwide. In resource-rich countries, the estimated incidence of pneumonia in full-term infants is <1 percent and up to 10 percent in extremely preterm infants who require mechanical ventilation.  'Introduction' above and 'Epidemiology' above.)\n【55】 Timing of onset – Neonatal pneumonia can be classified by the timing of onset as follows  'Timing of onset' above):\n【56】 Etiology\n【57】 Clinical presentation – Early-onset pneumonia commonly presents with respiratory distress beginning at or soon after birth. Other clinical manifestations, also\n【58】 Evaluation – Neonates with suspected bacterial pneumonia should undergo evaluation including laboratory tests, cultures, and chest radiography. If viral infection is suspected, appropriate viral testing should be performed.  'Evaluation' above.)\n【59】 Diagnosis – The diagnosis of neonatal pneumonia is based upon a combination of clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic findings. Characteristic chest radiograph findings (ie, bilateral pulmonary opacities or focal infiltrates with air bronchograms) in the appropriate clinical setting (ie, acute onset of respiratory symptoms and other signs of infection) are generally sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Positive cultures from blood or tracheal aspirates help confirm the diagnosis, but they are not required.  'Diagnosis' above.)\n【60】 Differential diagnosis – The differential diagnosis of neonatal pneumonia includes other causes of respiratory distress that may present in the newborn period, including :\n【61】 Management – Neonates with pneumonia can deteriorate rapidly. Thus, neonates with respiratory compromise should be managed in the neonatal intensive care unit setting where they can receive close cardiopulmonary monitoring and support.  'Supportive care' above.)\n【62】 Prognosis – The prognosis of neonatal pneumonia depends upon the severity of the disease, gestational age of the patient, underlying medical conditions, and infecting organism. Most term neonates managed in resource-rich settings recover well without long-term sequelae.

Management: Live organism vaccination should be withheld for as long as 6 to 11 months following immune globulin administration. Recommendations vary by product and immune globulin dose, see full monograph for details. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【71】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【72】 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) immune globulin is obtained from pooled human plasma and primarily contains IgG. Human IgG crosses the placenta. Fetal exposure is dependent upon the IgG subclass, maternal serum concentrations, placental integrity, newborn birth weight, and GA, generally increasing as pregnancy progresses. The lowest exposure would be expected during the period of organogenesis and the highest during the third trimester (Clements 2020; Palmeira 2012; Pentsuk 2009).\n【73】 CMV immune globulin has been evaluated for the treatment and prevention of congenital CMV infection (Devlieger 2021; Hughes 2021; Revello 2014). Maternal CMV infection may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including congenital CMV infection; however, until additional data are available, use of CMV immune globulin for the treatment of congenital CMV infection outside of a clinical trial is not currently recommended (SMFM 2016).\n【74】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【75】 Cytomegalovirus immune globulin is obtained from pooled human plasma and primarily contains IgG.\n【76】 Human immune globulin concentrations in breast milk are dependent upon IgG subclass and postpartum age (Anderson 2021).\n【77】 Dietary Considerations\n【78】 May contain sodium.\n【79】 Monitoring Parameters\n【80】 Renal function (BUN, serum creatinine prior to initial infusion and periodically thereafter); urine output; vital signs, including blood pressure (throughout infusion); signs/symptoms of infusion-related adverse reactions, anaphylaxis; signs and symptoms of hemolytic anemia; blood viscosity (baseline; in patients at risk for hyperviscosity); presence of antineutrophil antibodies (if TRALI is suspected); volume status; weight gain, clinical response\n【81】 Mechanism of Action\n【82】 CMV-IGIV is a preparation of immunoglobulin G (and trace amounts of IgA and IgM) derived from pooled healthy blood donors and contains a high titer of CMV antibodies; administration provides a passive source of antibodies against cytomegalovirus to attenuate or reduce the incidence of serious CMV disease\n【83】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【84】 Half-life elimination: 8 to 24 days\n【85】 Brand Names: International\n【86】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Cytomegalovirus immune globulin  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/cytomegalovirus-immune-globulin-drug-information?search=%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E5%85%8B-%E9%9B%85%E6%B0%8F%E7%97%85&source=search_result&selectedTitle=64%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:26:03"}

In children, nasal congestion is the most prominent symptom. Children can also have clear, yellow, or green-colored nasal discharge; fever (temperature higher than 100.4°F or 38°C) is common during the first three days of the illness. The table describes how to take a child's temperature\n【2】 Other symptoms may include sore throat, cough, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and decreased appetite. The lining of the nose may become red and swollen, and the lymph nodes (glands) in the neck may become slightly enlarged.\n【3】 The symptoms of a cold are usually worst during the first 10 days. However, some children continue to have a runny nose, congestion, and a cough beyond 10 days. In addition, it is not unusual for a child to develop a second cold as the symptoms of the first cold are resolving; this can make it\n【4】 Symptoms of allergies (allergic rhinitis) are slightly different than those of a cold and may include bothersome itching of the nose and eyes.   \"\n【5】 Common cold caused by SARS-CoV-2 – A common cold caused by SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) typically begins four to six days after exposure but may occur as long as 14 days after exposure. In most children, symptoms include fever and a nonproductive cough, although runny nose, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea may also occur. COVID-19 infection in children is usually mild or even asymptomatic. Severe infection, hospitalization, and death are less common in children than adults.\n【6】 Unfortunately, a cold caused by SARS-CoV-2 in a child looks like a cold caused by any other cold virus and can only be diagnosed with a COVID-19 test.   \"\n【7】 Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) – MIS-C is a life-threatening condition characterized by inflammation of the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs. It generally occurs in children age 6 to 12 years, but it can occur at any age. Affected children have fever and appear ill. They also may have abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, or bloodshot eyes.\n【8】 Caregivers who are concerned that their child may have MIS-C should seek emergency care.\n【9】 Inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) or the sac surrounding the heart (pericarditis) – Myocarditis and pericarditis are life-threatening complications of COVID-19. In children with myocarditis or pericarditis, exercise can lead to an abnormal heart rhythm, which may cause sudden death in young athletes.\n【10】 Children and adolescents can have myocarditis or pericarditis without any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they include chest pain, problems breathing, a racing heart, and fatigue.\n【11】 Because heart conditions can be present without symptoms, all children with known or suspected COVID-19 should be evaluated by their clinician for signs and symptoms relating to the heart before returning to physical activity (eg, organized sports training, practice, or competition; physical education class; recreational sports) . The type of evaluation (by phone, telehealth, or in-person) varies with the severity of illness.\n【12】 Keep all of the child's immunizations up to date. Evidence suggests that children who received an influenza (flu) vaccine in the current flu season who were infected with COVID-19 were less likely to have symptoms and severe disease. Similarly, children who completed their pneumococcal vaccine series (sample brand name: Prevnar) were less likely to have symptoms when infected with COVID-19.\n【13】 Hand washing is an essential and highly effective way to prevent the spread of infection. Hands should be wet with water and plain soap, and rubbed together for 15 to 30 seconds. It is not necessary to use antibacterial hand soap. Teach children to wash their hands before and after eating and after coughing or sneezing.\n【14】 Alcohol-based hand rubs are a good alternative for disinfecting hands if a sink is not available. Hand rubs should be spread over the entire surface of hands, fingers, and wrists until dry and may be used several times. These rubs can be used repeatedly without skin irritation or loss of effectiveness.\n【15】 It may be difficult or impossible to completely avoid people who are ill, although caregivers should try to limit direct contact.\n【16】 Isolate children with known or suspected COVID-19 infection according to local and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance. Isolation includes:\n【17】 During the COVID-19 pandemic, children with known or suspected COVID-19 infection should quarantine (ie, stay home) according to local and CDC guidance.\n【18】 Using a household cleaner that kills viruses, such as phenol/alcohol (sample brand name: Lysol), may help to reduce viral transmission.\n【19】 Refusing to drink anything for a prolonged period\n【20】 Behavior changes, including irritability or lethargy (decreased responsiveness); this usually requires immediate medical attention\n【21】 Difficulty breathing, working hard to breathe, or breathing rapidly; this usually requires immediate medical attention\n【22】 Fever greater than 101°F (38.4°C) lasts more than three days. The table describes how to take a child's temperature .\n【23】 Nasal congestion worsens or does not improve over the course of 10 days.\n【24】 The eyes become red or develop yellow discharge.\n【25】 There are signs or symptoms of an ear infection (pain, ear pulling, fussiness).\n【26】 The common cold is a group of symptoms caused by a number of different viruses, including severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19. Children under six years average six to eight colds per year (up to one per month, September through April), with symptoms lasting an average of 14 days. This means that a child could be ill with intermittent cold symptoms for nearly half of the days in this time period, without cause for concern.\n【27】 Colds are most contagious during the first two to four days. People with colds typically carry the cold virus on their hands, where it is capable of infecting another person for at least two hours. Some cold viruses can live on surfaces (such as countertops, door handles, or toys) for as long as one day. Droplets containing viral particles can be exhaled into the air by breathing, coughing, or sneezing.\n【28】 The signs and symptoms of a cold usually begin one to two days after exposure. In children, nasal congestion is the most prominent symptom. Children can also have clear, yellow, or green-colored nasal discharge. Fever (temperature higher than 100.4°F or 38°C) is common during the first three days of the illness. Other symptoms may include sore throat, cough, irritability, difficulty sleeping, and decreased appetite.\n【29】 COVID-19 infection in children is frequently either asymptomatic or results in a mild cold with fever and a cough (although runny nose, abdominal pain, vomiting, or other symptoms may occur). Infection caused by COVID-19 typically begins four to six days after exposure but may occur as long as 14 days after exposure. Severe infection, hospitalization, and death are less common in children than adults.\n【30】 A cold caused by COVID-19 in a child looks like a cold caused by any other cold virus and can only be diagnosed with a COVID-19 test.\n【31】 Children with known or suspected COVID-19 infection should stay home according to local and Centers for Control and Prevention guidance.\n【32】 Most children who have colds do not develop complications. However, caregivers should be aware of the signs and symptoms of potential complications, including ear infections, asthma, sinusitis, pneumonia, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, myocarditis, and pericarditis.\n【33】 All children with known or suspected COVID-19 should be evaluated by their clinician for signs and symptoms relating to the heart before returning to physical activity (eg, organized sports training, practice, or competition; physical education class; recreational sports), as children may develop serious heart complications due to COVID-19 without apparent symptoms. The type of evaluation (by phone, telehealth, or in person) varies with the severity of the illness.\n【34】 There have been few clinical trials of cold medications (antihistamines, decongestants, cough medicines, and expectorants) in infants and children. We do not recommend their use in infants and children because of the lack of proven efficacy and the potential risk of dangerous side effects.\n【35】 Caregivers may give acetaminophen (sample brand name: Tylenol) to children older than three months or ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) to children older than six months to treat discomfort associated with fever. Humidified air can improve symptoms of nasal congestion and runny nose. Honey may be helpful for nighttime cough in children older than 12 months.\n【36】 Caregivers should encourage their child to drink an adequate amount of fluids; it is not necessary to drink extra fluids.\n【37】 Antibiotics are not effective in treating colds. They may be necessary if the cold is complicated by a bacterial infection, like an ear infection, pneumonia, or sinusitis. Caregivers who think their child has developed one of these infections should contact their child's health care provider. Inappropriate use of antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic resistance and can possibly lead to side effects, such as an allergic reaction.\n【38】 A number of alternative products, including zinc, vitamin C, and herbal products such as echinacea, are advertised to treat or prevent the common cold. None of these treatments is recommended. With the possible exception of vitamin C, none of these treatments have been proven to be effective in clinical trials. Although there is some evidence that prophylactic use of vitamin C may decrease the duration of the common cold in children, it is insufficient to recommend routine use.\n【39】 Simple hygiene measures can help to prevent infection with the viruses that cause colds, including hand washing or use of an alcohol-based hand rub and limiting contact with others who are ill.\n【40】 Keeping all of the child’s immunizations up to date, including flu (children aged six months and older) and COVID-19, is also important in preventing infections.\n【41】 National Library of Medicine\n【42】 National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases\n【43】 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n【44】 Phone: (404) 639-3534\n【45】 Toll-free: (800) 311-3435\n", "title": "Patient education  The common cold in children (Beyond the Basics)", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/the-common-cold-in-children-beyond-the-basics?search=%E4%B8%BA%E6%8A%97%E9%BB%84%E7%83%AD%E7%97%85%E9%87%87%E5%8F%96%E5%BF%85%E8%A6%81%E7%9A%84%E5%85%8D%E7%96%AB&source=search_result&selectedTitle=97%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 19:42:43"}

STI prophylaxis is not routinely recommended for prepubertal victims for the following reasons :\n【7】 Excessive concern by the caregiver or child concerning STI may make prophylactic treatment appropriate. However, cultures must be obtained prior to treatment whenever prophylaxis is prescribed.   \"Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents\", section on 'Sexually transmitted infection testing'.)\n【8】 Diagnoses of STIs in prepubertal children have profound consequences for the child, family or caregivers, and alleged perpetrator and are likely to be challenged in court. Because cultures can miss some STIs, prophylaxis can complicate efforts to protect children when initial testing is in doubt. Given the low risk of ascending infection in prepubertal children, it is reasonable to withhold treatment until all follow-up testing is complete and a definitive diagnosis has been established.\n【9】 Postpubertal – We suggest that postpubertal children who have been sexually abused receive antibiotic prophylaxis for STIs. Postpubertal females should definitely be offered STI prophylaxis if the assailant is known to be infected, the victim has signs or symptoms of infection, or at the victim's request. Additional considerations are the high prevalence of pre-existing asymptomatic infection, the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease, and the possibility of loss to follow-up. For these reasons, STI prophylaxis is routinely offered even when there are no symptoms, and the infection status of the assailant is unknown.\n【10】 Some experts recommend that all postpubertal patients be screened for STIs, including HIV, because the prevalence of pre-existing asymptomatic infection is high . Others do not routinely test for STI because identification of an infection is unlikely to provide useful evidence and prophylactic treatment is typically prescribed regardless of culture results. Therefore, the decision to test a victim of sexual abuse for STIs should be made on an individual basis .\n【11】 Testing for STIs in pediatric victims of sexual abuse is covered in greater detail separately.   \"Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents\", section on 'Sexually transmitted infection testing' and  \"Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims in the emergency department\", section on 'Laboratory testing and diagnostic imaging'.)\n【12】 The likelihood that the perpetrator is HIV positive\n【13】 The nature of the sexual contact and its estimated risk for HIV transmission (eg, whether it involved transfer of secretions, injury, or multiple perpetrators)\n【14】 The time elapsed since the first contact\n【15】 Whether the victim has other ongoing risk factors for HIV infection\n【16】 If the perpetrator is not HBsAg positive and the victim is fully immunized, then no action is needed. Unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated patients should receive hepatitis B vaccine at the initial evaluation with ensured completion of the vaccine series using an age-appropriate dose and schedule\n【17】 The approach to prophylaxis when the perpetrator is HBsAg positive, or status is unknown is similar to exposed adults and is discussed separately.   \"Management of nonoccupational exposures to HIV and hepatitis B and C in adults\", section on 'Overview'.)\n【18】 Will the child return to an environment where the suspected perpetrator will still have access to the child?\n【19】 Is there a possibility that the child may be punished by caregivers for his/her disclosure of sexual abuse?\n【20】 Is there a possibility that the child may be coerced by caregivers to recant his/her disclosure?\n【21】 Pre-employment screening – All staff and volunteers who have access to children in a health care setting should undergo screening during recruitment and hiring. The screening should consist of any history of child abuse allegations as determined by examination of prior employment and checks of criminal background and child abuse registries. While essential, employment screening alone is insufficient to provide protection because a small minority of people who molest children have a criminal record.\n【22】 Culture of safety – Institutional policy must demonstrate zero tolerance of sexual encounters with patients. Health care facilities should also establish a culture of safety that provides training of all employees in the health care setting on their role in preventing sexual abuse and their specific individual duty to report concerns of abuse to Child Protective Services and/or law enforcement according to the laws of their jurisdiction.\n【23】 Employee training – All employees warrant education regarding staff-patient boundary setting, chaperone use during the anogenital examination and other sensitive body regions, and their responsibility to report sexual abuse by other health care providers to the proper authorities.\n【24】 Provider communication and safe practice – Physicians, advanced practice providers, and nurses who perform examination of sensitive areas such as anogenital examinations or, in adolescent females, breast examinations have the responsibility to explain the purpose of the examination to the patient and family/caregiver. The provider should also obtain consent from the parent/primary caregiver and, for older children and adolescents, the child. Providers should perform the examination with chaperones according to established procedures  and in a manner that respects the patient's modesty. The use of chaperones for anogenital examination is described separately.   \"The pediatric physical examination: The perineum\", section on 'Use of chaperones'.)\n【25】 Response to abuse allegations – All patient, parent/caregiver, or staff allegations of sexual abuse by a health care provider require documentation, timely investigation, and, when there is sufficient suspicion for sexual abuse, adherence to mandated reporting, if not already performed, according to legal requirements of the jurisdiction   \"Child abuse: Social and medicolegal issues\"). Institutional and office policies and procedures should delineate an internal confidential investigation process that assists in determining when there is sufficient concern for abuse and ensures that, in addition to reporting to Child Protective Services and law enforcement, sexual misconduct or abuse is reported to licensing authorities such as national or regional medical boards.\n【26】 In a systematic review of the impact of sexual abuse on children, the severity of symptoms was affected by penetration, the duration and frequency of the abuse, force, the relationship of the perpetrator to the child, and maternal support .\n【27】 In a cross-sectional survey describing adolescents with histories of sexual abuse, favorable social factors (family connectedness, teacher caring, other adult caring, and school safety) were significantly protective for suicide risk .\n【28】 In the United States, many communities have a Children's Advocacy Center that provides expertise in the evaluation and treatment of sexual abuse victims and the prosecution of sexual abuse perpetrators. These centers may provide social services, law enforcement agencies, legal services, and medical evaluation and may be a resource for consultation. There is evidence that Children's Advocacy Centers and the multidisciplinary team approach for child sexual abuse investigations may aid in improving prosecution rates of suspected perpetrators and the experiences of families or caregivers of patients with suspected sexual abuse . Local advocacy centers can be identified on the National Children's Alliance website.\n【29】 The World Health Organization (WHO) provides educational materials regarding international policy and program development for addressing child maltreatment, including sexual abuse, at its website.\n【30】 The International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (ISPCAN) provides support for professional development of child abuse and neglect identification and management skills, child protection, and data collection in under-resourced countries where such infrastructure is lacking. Materials are available at its website.\n【31】 Management – The management of all children who have been sexually abused must include attention to the immediate medical and social needs of patients and families or caregivers as well as to the local requirements for mandated reporting. Management should be performed by a multidisciplinary child abuse team whenever possible. Urgent evaluation and treatment, typically in an emergency setting, is necessary for patients with any one of the following situations  'Management' above):\n【32】 STI prophylaxis – With regard to prophylactic treatments to prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs), we offer the following recommendations  'Sexually transmitted infection prophylaxis' above):\n【33】 Emergency contraception – Emergency contraception should be offered to all postpubertal female patients and should be strongly advised to females at highest risk for pregnancy. Emergency contraceptive preparations and administration are discussed in detail separately.  'Pregnancy prophylaxis' above and  \"Emergency contraception\".)\n【34】 Sequelae – Children who have been sexually abused may experience psychological and behavioral sequelae. They and their families or caregivers should be offered a referral to a mental health professional.  'Sequelae' above.)\n【35】 Reporting and disposition – Physicians in many countries (eg, United States, Canada, Germany, and Japan) are required to report all cases of suspected or known child sexual abuse. The designated agency to which sexual abuse should be reported varies by region; physicians should be aware of the local laws.  'Mandated reporting' above.)\n【36】 In addition, if any of the following risks to safety are present, the clinician should contact Child Protection Services and/or law enforcement:\n", "title": "Management and sequelae of sexual abuse in children and adolescents", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/management-and-sequelae-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents?search=%E8%BA%AB%E4%BD%93%E8%99%90%E5%BE%85%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%B2&source=search_result&selectedTitle=72%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:22:29"}

Use following cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation.\n【35】 Corneal thinning: Various ophthalmic disorders, as well as prolonged use of corticosteroids, may result in corneal and scleral thinning. Continued use in a patient with thinning may result in perforation.\n【36】 Glaucoma: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and/or glaucoma; damage to the optic nerve; and defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. Use with caution in patients with glaucoma; monitor IOP in any patient receiving treatment for ≥10 days.\n【37】 Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids (including ophthalmic preparations) may increase the incidence of secondary ocular infections (including fungal infections). Acute purulent ocular infections may be masked or exacerbated with use. Fungal infection should be suspected in any patient with persistent corneal ulceration who has received corticosteroids.\n【38】 Systemic absorption: Studies have demonstrated topical ophthalmic corticosteroids are absorbed systemically and may cause endogenous corticosteroid production reduction. Caution is advised with prolonged use of topical ophthalmic corticosteroids in terms of systemic immunosuppression and additional systemic hazard of corticosteroid exposure (Burch 1968).\n【39】 Herpes simplex: Corticosteroids should not be used to treat ocular herpes simplex; may exacerbate the severity of the infection. Use extreme caution in patients with history of herpes simplex.\n【40】 Contact lens wearers: Some preparations may contain benzalkonium chloride, which may be absorbed by contact lenses. Contact lenses should not be worn when using loteprednol 0.38% gel or 0.5% ophthalmic gel, ointment, or suspension. However, contact lenses may be reinserted 15 minutes following administration of loteprednol 0.25% and 1% ophthalmic suspension or ≥10 minutes following administration of loteprednol 0.2% ophthalmic suspension.\n【41】 Pediatric: Avoid use of ointment in children following amblyopia treatment since ointment consistency may hinder ability to see out of treated eye.\n【42】 Propylene glycol: Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; large amounts are potentially toxic and have been associated with hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP [\"Inactive\" 1997]; Zar 2007).\n【43】 Acute anterior uveitis: More potent steroids may be required for this indication.\n【44】 Appropriate use: For ophthalmic use only; patients should be re-evaluated if symptoms fail to improve after 2 days. Initial prescription and renewal of medication after 14 days should be made by healthcare provider only after examination with the aid of magnification such as slit lamp biomicroscopy or fluorescein staining (if appropriate) and evaluation of intraocular pressure (0.25% suspension). Avoid contamination; do not touch tip of applicator or let tip of applicator touch eye.\n【45】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【46】 Increased intraocular pressure (IOP) may occur especially with prolonged use of ophthalmic corticosteroids; in children on ophthalmic dexamethasone, increased IOP has been shown to be dose dependent and produce a greater IOP in children <6 years than older children (Lam 2005).\n【47】 Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; in neonates, large amounts of propylene glycol delivered orally, intravenously (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically have been associated with potentially fatal toxicities which can include metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, and CNS depression; toxicities have also been reported in children and adults including hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures, and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Shehab 2009).\n【48】 Dosage Forms: US\n【49】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【50】 Gel, Ophthalmic, as etabonate:\n【51】 Lotemax: 0.5% (5 g) [contains benzalkonium chloride, edetate (edta) disodium dihydrate, propylene glycol]\n【52】 Lotemax SM: 0.38% (5 g) [contains benzalkonium chloride, edetate (edta) disodium dihydrate, propylene glycol]\n【53】 Generic: 0.5% (5 g)\n【54】 Ointment, Ophthalmic, as etabonate:\n【55】 Lotemax: 0.5% (3.5 g)\n【56】 Suspension, Ophthalmic:\n【57】 Eysuvis: 0.25% (8.3 mL) [contains benzalkonium chloride, edetate (edta) disodium dihydrate]\n【58】 Inveltys: 1% (2.8 mL) [contains benzalkonium chloride, edetate (edta) disodium dihydrate]\n【59】 Suspension, Ophthalmic, as etabonate:\n【60】 Alrex: 0.2% (5 mL, 10 mL)\n【61】 Lotemax: 0.5% (5 mL, 10 mL, 15 mL)\n【62】 Generic: 0.5% (5 mL, 10 mL, 15 mL)\n【63】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【64】 May be product dependent\n【65】 Pricing: US\n【66】 0.5% (per gram): $57.79\n【67】 0.38% (per gram): $57.79\n【68】 0.5% (per gram): $46.24\n【69】 0.5% (per gram): $116.17\n【70】 0.2% (per mL): $67.71\n【71】 0.25% (per mL): $72.02\n【72】 1% (per mL): $129.29\n【73】 0.5% (per mL): $72.02\n【74】 0.5% (per mL): $45.07 - $51.29\n【75】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【76】 Alrex: 0.2% (5 mL)\n【77】 Lotemax: 0.5% (5 mL, 10 mL)\n【78】 Administration: Pediatric\n【79】 Ophthalmic: For topical ophthalmic use.

The manufacturer's labeling for the 0.25% and 1% suspension formulation recommends separating administration of other ophthalmic agents by at least 5 minutes.\n【83】 Storage/Stability\n【84】 Store at 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F); do not freeze.\n【85】 Use\n【86】 Ophthalmic:\n【87】 Gel:\n【88】 0.38% gel (Lotemax SM): Treatment of postoperative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery (FDA approved in adults)\n【89】 0.5% gel (Lotemax): Treatment of postoperative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery (FDA approved in all ages)\n【90】 Ointment (Lotemax 0.5%): Treatment of postoperative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery (FDA approved in adults)\n【91】 Suspension:\n【92】 0.2% suspension (Alrex): Temporary relief of signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (FDA approved in adults)\n【93】 0.5% suspension (Lotemax): Treatment of steroid-responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea, and anterior segment of the globe (eg, allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitis, when the inherent hazard of steroid use is accepted to obtain an advisable diminution in edema and inflammation); treatment of postoperative inflammation following ocular surgery (All indications: FDA approved in adults)\n【94】 1% suspension (Inveltys): Treatment of postoperative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery (FDA approved in adults)\n【95】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【96】 None known.\n【97】 Drug Interactions\n【98】 There are no known significant interactions.\n【99】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【100】 The amount of loteprednol absorbed systemically following ophthalmic administration is not known but expected to be <1 ng/mL.\n【101】 If ophthalmic agents are needed during pregnancy, the minimum effective dose should be used in combination with punctal occlusion to decrease potential exposure to the fetus (Samples 1988).\n【102】 Monitoring Parameters\n【103】 Intraocular pressure (especially with use >10 days); signs or symptoms of ocular infection\n【104】 Mechanism of Action\n【105】 Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response including edema, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, and scar formation. Loteprednol is highly lipid soluble and penetrates cells readily to induce the production of lipocortins. These proteins modulate the activity of prostaglandins and leukotrienes.\n【106】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【107】 Onset of action: Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis: Reduction of symptoms seen within 2 hours of instillation.\n【108】 Absorption: Minimal; chronic ophthalmic administration resulted in plasma levels of loteprednol and its metabolite below the level of quantitation (1 ng/mL).\n【109】 Distribution: Penetrates most readily into the cornea, followed by the iris/ciliary body and aqueous humor.\n【110】 Metabolism: Metabolized to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites by corneal esterases primarily in the cornea. Once the glucocorticoid receptor is activated, loteprednol undergoes rapid metabolism and minimizing adverse effects (Sheppard 2016).\n【111】 Brand Names: International\n【112】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Loteprednol  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/loteprednol-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E5%89%8D%E8%91%A1%E8%90%84%E8%86%9C%E7%82%8E&source=search_result&selectedTitle=121%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 01:31:23"}

They can occur anywhere in the neuraxis, but most are supratentorial and located in the temporal lobes. Seizures are the most common presenting symptom, and long-standing epilepsy is frequent. Gangliogliomas can be an incidental finding when temporal lobectomies are performed to treat epilepsy .\n【2】 Imaging – On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), these tumors are hyperintense on T2-weighted images (image 1) . One-half of cases have cysts and approximately one-third have calcifications . Contrast enhancement varies from none to marked and may be solid or rim enhancing.\n【3】 Pathology and genetics – Gangliogliomas are composed of dysplastic neuronal cells accompanied by neoplastic glial cells. By contrast, in gangliocytomas, large, well-differentiated neurons are the sole neoplastic component.\n【4】 Up to 60 percent of gangliogliomas harbor a BRAF V600E mutation, which has been associated with higher risk for recurrence after standard therapy in pediatric low-grade gliomas . The mutant protein is found primarily in the neuronal cells . Midline gangliogliomas may harbor mutations in both H3F3A K27M and BRAF V600E in both the glial and neuronal components . More rarely, tumors harbor oncogenic fusions involving genes such as neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK), which are mutually exclusive with BRAF alterations, and which may be therapeutically relevant .\n【5】 Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase type 1 (IDH1), when found in tumors histologically appearing like gangliogliomas, strongly support the alternate diagnosis of diffuse glioma and are associated with an older age at diagnosis, a greater risk of recurrence, and a poorer prognosis .   \"Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas, glioneuronal tumors, and neuronal tumors\", section on 'IDH1/IDH2 mutation'.)\n【6】 Treatment and prognosis – The initial management is surgical resection. While gross total resection is optimal, the prognosis is good even after subtotal resection. Late recurrences can occur in either case. This was illustrated by a series of 62 adult patients with ganglioglioma in which the five-year progression-free survival was 78 percent after gross total resection and 62 percent after subtotal resection . Time to progression ranged from 2 months to 20 years and was significantly shorter in patients older than 40 years at the time of diagnosis (14 versus 3 years).\n【7】 Radiation therapy is not recommended for patients who have had a complete resection. A retrospective review of the literature suggests that radiation therapy after subtotal resection improves local tumor control in both low- and high-grade gangliogliomas . However, no effect on overall survival was demonstrated. These data are insufficient to make a firm recommendation about the role of radiation therapy after subtotal resection of ganglioglioma.\n【8】 Although less than 10 percent of gangliogliomas become anaplastic, the presence of anaplasia in gangliogliomas is ominous. Despite aggressive management with radiation and chemotherapy, anaplastic gangliogliomas are usually fatal . Of note, a formal designation of anaplastic (grade 3) ganglioglioma was removed from the 2021 WHO classification, and such tumors should undergo molecular testing as they may harbor variants more consistent with an alternative tumor type .\n【9】 For BRAF V600E-mutant tumors, BRAF inhibitors alone or in combination with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors have clinical antitumor activity as well as antiseizure effects . Benefit from the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib was shown in the phase 2 open-label ROAR trial, which included 13 patients with low-grade glioma (five with gangliocytoma or ganglioglioma) . In the low-grade glioma cohort, the objective response rate was 69 percent and median duration of response was 27.5 months; median progression-free survival was 14 months, and median overall survival was not yet reached. Grade 3 or 4 adverse effects occurred in 53 percent of patients in the trial, most commonly fatigue, neutropenia, and headache. Based on these and other data, the combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib was granted tissue-agnostic approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in patients ≥6 years of age with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E-mutant solid tumors that have progressed on previous treatment . The combination is also specifically approved for BRAF V600E-mutant low-grade glioma in children one year of age and older .\n【10】 For tumors with an NTRK fusion detected , the NTRK inhibitors entrectinib and larotrectinib may be an option and are approved by the FDA in children >12 years of age with tumors with an NTRK fusion that have failed prior standard therapies or are nonresectable.   \"Management of recurrent high-grade gliomas\", section on 'Genotype-directed therapies'.)\n【11】 Clinical features – DNTs are slow-growing, supratentorial masses. They typically occur in children and young adults with a long-standing history of intractable focal epilepsy. Patients with DNTs generally have minimal or no neurologic signs other than seizures. Rare histologically defined DNTs in the septum pellucidum are now classified separately as myxoid glioneuronal tumors .  'Myxoid glioneuronal tumor' below.)\n【12】 Imaging – On MRI, DNTs are T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense (image 2). The lesions are based in and focally expand the cortex, sometimes extending into the white matter. Gadolinium enhancement is variable, occurring in less than one-half of cases; enhancement is patchy and multifocal rather than diffuse . There is sometimes skull molding adjacent to the lesions due to slow tumor growth.\n【13】 Pathology and genetics – Key pathologic features of DNTs include the presence of entrapped cortical neurons, foci of dysplastic cortical organization, a multinodular architecture with components resembling astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma, and a columnar structure oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface. DNTs are distinguished from diffuse gliomas and other low-grade brain tumors by histologic and molecular features.\n【14】 Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) gene alterations are observed in 40 to 60 percent of DNTs . BRAF V600E mutations have been reported in up to 50 percent of DNTs, although some of these tumors may be reclassified as ganglioglioma or MAPK pathway-altered low-grade gliomas with complete histomolecular analysis . Neither IDH1 nor IDH2 mutations are consistent with DNT, and the presence of either suggests a diffuse glioma, as does codeletion of 1p and 19q.\n【15】 Treatment and prognosis – Surgery is indicated for refractory seizures, but lesions in eloquent cortex are best observed, if possible. Most patients are seizure free at least initially following surgery . However, the incidence of seizures appears to increase with longer duration of follow-up. This was illustrated by a series of 26 children, in which 62 percent remained seizure free at a median follow-up of 4.3 years . The main risk factors for recurrent seizures were age >10 years and longer duration of epilepsy (>2 years) prior to surgery. Rarely, tumor recurrence or even malignant transformation may occur .\n【16】 Clinical features – Dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum is typically seen in young and middle-aged adults, although the disease has been diagnosed in patients as young as 3 years and as old as 70 years. Cerebellar symptoms may be present for a number of years prior to establishing the diagnosis, and obstructive hydrocephalus is common. The lesion arises in the cerebellar hemispheres, with rare extension into the vermis. An association with developmental disabilities including macrocephaly and intellectual disability is not uncommon.\n【17】 Imaging – On MRI, dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma is characterized by enlarged cerebellar folia with distorted architecture and variable cystic change (image 4). The lesion is typically nonenhancing and T1 hypointense, and T2-weighted images are characterized by a laminar pattern of alternating high and low signal. The mass is well circumscribed and distinct from the surrounding tissue. In rare cases it enhances with contrast, which may represent venous proliferation in the outer portions of the cerebellar cortex and prominent draining veins .\n【18】 Pathology and genetics – Histologically, there is reduced cerebellar white matter and presence of abnormal hypertrophic ganglion cells that are reminiscent of Purkinje cells.\n【19】 Dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum can be familial or sporadic. Molecular studies in patients with dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum suggest a high frequency of abnormalities in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/AKT pathway, a major regulator of cell growth . As such, this tumor has been linked to Cowden syndrome, an autosomal dominantly inherited condition characterized by multiple hamartomatous growths; an increased incidence of breast, uterine, and thyroid cancer; and germline mutations in the PTEN gene.\n【20】 Most adults, but not children, with dysplastic gangliocytoma have PTEN germline mutations . Dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum is a major criterion for Cowden syndrome in revised diagnostic criteria, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network considers its presence to be an indication for genetic testing for Cowden syndrome\n【21】 Treatment – Treatment of dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum is surgical resection; a few reported cases have recurred after apparent gross total resection. Inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/PTEN/AKT pathway with rapamycin was effective in one case of an infant with severe, symptomatic bilateral dysplastic gangliocytoma .\n【22】 Because of the association with Cowden syndrome in adults, clinicians should exclude concomitant malignancies (particularly breast and genitourinary cancers) and refer patients for genetic testing for Cowden syndrome .   \"Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes\".)\n【23】 Clinical features – The mean age at diagnosis in patients with central neurocytoma is 29 years . Most patients present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus. Visual disturbances and impaired cognitive function may also be present. Focal neurologic deficits are uncommon. A few patients have presented with intraventricular hemorrhage.\n【24】 Most central neurocytomas are multicystic and calcified, with a broad-based attachment to the superolateral wall of the ventricle. They are typically found in the lateral or third ventricle, attached to the septum pellucidum or ventricular wall at the foramen of Monro. They do not usually occur in the occipital or temporal horns. Despite their usual intraventricular location, leptomeningeal dissemination is extremely rare .\n【25】 Imaging – The typical computed tomography (CT) appearance is that of a heterogeneous, hyperdense intraventricular mass with moderate contrast enhancement (image 5). On MRI, they are slightly hyperintense on T1-weighted images; the appearance on T2-weighted images is somewhat more variable. They usually enhance with gadolinium. Both central and extraventricular neurocytomas may be difficult to distinguish from more common lesions like high-grade gliomas on MRI .\n【26】 Pathology and genetics – Neurocytomas are considered neuroectodermal tumors with predominant neuronal differentiation. They characteristically stain diffusely positive for synaptophysin, and most are immunoreactive for NeuN. Recurrent genetic alterations have not been identified in central neurocytomas . A characteristic alteration in extraventricular neurocytoma is the FGFR1-transforming acidic coiled-coil containing protein 1 (TACC1) fusion .\n【27】 Treatment and prognosis – The optimal treatment is complete surgical resection. Even subtotal resection may be associated with prolonged survival, since these tumors usually regrow slowly. The prognosis appears to be better in patients with typical neurocytomas (ie, a growth fraction <3 percent, as measured by the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody) , and adjuvant radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery may be useful for patients with an incomplete resection or atypical histology .\n【28】 Recurrent or progressive tumors are typically treated with focal radiation . At least one report suggests that recurrent central neurocytomas may be responsive to systemic chemotherapy .\n【29】 The outcomes and prognostic factors associated with the treatment of central neurocytoma are illustrated by the results of treatment in a retrospective series of 45 patients treated over a 35-year period using surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy . The 10-year survival and local control rates were better for those with typical neurocytomas compared with atypical lesions (90 versus 63 percent and 74 versus 46 percent, respectively). Postoperative radiation therapy improved local control at 10 years (75 versus 51 percent without postoperative radiation therapy), but this did not translate into an overall survival benefit. A multicenter study of 71 cases, which included an immunohistochemical assessment of tumors, found that extent of surgery was the sole prognostic marker. However, the study may have had an insufficient number of cases to identify a MIB-1 index prognostic threshold .\n【30】 Clinical features – Pilocytic astrocytomas (World Health Organization [WHO] grade 1) are the most common gliomas in children, with a median age at diagnosis of eight years . They are circumscribed tumors that frequently arise in the cerebellum and present with signs and symptoms of mass effect, obstructive hydrocephalus, and increased intracranial pressure. Other common locations include the optic pathway and midline structures (eg, hypothalamus, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord).\n【31】 Approximately 25 percent of pilocytic astrocytomas occur after the age of 20 years, more commonly in the cerebral hemispheres than cerebellum . Leptomeningeal dissemination occurs rarely, most often in association with infantile or hypothalamic presentations .\n【32】 Imaging – On MRI, pilocytic astrocytomas are usually hyperintense on T2-weighted images and have variable T1 signal. In the posterior fossa and cerebral hemispheres, most pilocytic astrocytomas appear as a well-demarcated, expansile mass consisting of an enhancing mural nodule with a surrounding cyst (image 6). Tumors in the brainstem or optic apparatus may be solid or cystic, with variable enhancement patterns . Surrounding edema is mild or absent. For tumors in the posterior fossa in children, the degree of T2 hyperintensity associated with the solid portion of the tumor helps to distinguish pilocytic astrocytoma from medulloblastoma .\n【33】 Pathology and genetics – Pilocytic astrocytomas typically have a biphasic appearance, with compact areas of bipolar cells and Rosenthal fibers alternating with loose and myxoid regions with oligodendrocyte-like cells\n【34】 Most tumors harbor alterations that affect mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling . The single most common alteration is BRAF-KIAA fusion, which is observed in approximately 60 percent of tumors . Other alterations include neurofibromin 1 (NF1) mutations (mostly germline in patients with NF1), BRAF V600E point mutations (5 to 10 percent), BRAF fusions with genes other than KIAA, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) mutations, and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) gene fusions . Pilocytic astrocytomas do not harbor mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and usually have retained ATRX expression; loss of ATRX should prompt consideration of high-grade astrocytoma with piloid features .\n【35】 Treatment – Pilocytic astrocytomas are circumscribed tumors, and they are usually curable if completely resected. Malignant transformation of pilocytic astrocytomas occurs in less than 5 percent of cases .\n【36】 Surgical resection is the standard initial approach, and the goal is complete resection and relief of hydrocephalus, if present. Even if resection is incomplete, radiation therapy and chemotherapy are usually withheld until there is evidence of tumor growth. Radiation therapy at the time of diagnosis may be required for patients in whom surgery is not feasible . Radiation therapy is also used to treat progressive disease following surgical resection. When radiation therapy is recommended, an involved field fractionated course to 54 Gy is most commonly used.\n【37】 Therapies targeting BRAF and the MAPK pathway as well as next-generation RAF inhibitors are under investigation in trials . For tumors with an activating BRAF V600E mutation, BRAF plus MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor therapy (eg, dabrafenib/trametinib, vemurafenib/cobimetinib) may be considered in patients with residual disease despite maximal resection in both the adjuvant and recurrent/refractory settings . Dabrafenib/trametinib has US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in children ≥1 year of age with BRAF V600E-mutant low-grade gliomas that require systemic therapy as well as tissue-agnostic approval for BRAF V600E-mutant tumors in patients ≥6 years of age .  'Ganglioglioma and gangliocytoma' above.)\n【38】 For patients without targetable alterations, the combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan was well tolerated and showed some evidence of activity in a small single-arm study that included 16 children with recurrent pilocytic astrocytoma .\n【39】 Prognosis – Pilocytic astrocytomas have a much better prognosis than diffuse astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas . With complete surgical resection, pilocytic astrocytomas are curable. Even incomplete tumor resection is often associated with prolonged survival. As an example, in a series of 361 pediatric patients with low-grade gliomas treated at a single institution over a 22-year period, 63 percent of patients had pilocytic astrocytoma . The 10- and 20-year overall survival rates for the entire series were 87 and 82 percent, respectively. However, a substantial number of long-term survivors did experience adverse outcomes including, for example, intellectual impairment, endocrine abnormalities, hearing loss, and blindness.\n【40】 Long-term outcomes are less favorable in adult patients . Based on retrospective studies, the recurrence rate after gross total resection in adults approaches 30 percent . In a population-based study of 865 adults (>20 years) with pilocytic astrocytoma in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results R) database, cancer-specific five-year survival rates were 92, 79, and 64 percent for patients ages 20 to 39, 40 to 59, and >60 years, respectively .\n【41】 Clinical features – Astroblastomas usually occur in older children and young adults , although patients as old as 71 years have been described . MN1-altered astroblastoma in particular appears to have a striking female predominance (39 of 41 patients in one series) and affects primarily children <15 years of age . Astroblastomas occur predominantly in the cerebral hemispheres and often present with seizures.\n【42】 Imaging – On MRI, these are discrete, lobulated, supratentorial lesions with solid and cystic components. The solid component has been described as having a characteristic \"bubbly\" appearance on T2-weighted sequences . T2 hypointensity is frequently noted, and contrast enhancement and calcification are variable.\n【43】 Pathology and genetics – Astroblastomas have features of both astrocytoma and ependymoma; unlike ependymoma, however, the majority stain positive for oligodendrocyte transcription factor 2 (OLIG2) . The characteristic finding is diffuse, perivascular, astroblastic pseudorosettes. Low-grade and high-grade variants exist, and grade and mitotic index appear to correlate with prognosis .\n【44】 Treatment and prognosis – Gross total resection of a low-grade lesion frequently confers a long disease-free interval. For high-grade histologically defined astroblastomas, treatment has traditionally consisted of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, although the effectiveness of adjuvant therapy is controversial. Patients diagnosed after 30 years of age appear to have worse overall survival compared with young patients .\n【45】 Epidemiology – Choroid plexus tumors account for less than 1 percent of all intracranial tumors; in children under age one year, they account for 10 to 15 percent of intracranial tumors. Choroid plexus papillomas are benign and account for approximately 60 percent of these tumors .\n【46】 Clinical features – Headache is the most common symptom of choroid plexus tumors, reflecting increased intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus can occur due to increased CSF production, obstruction of CSF flow, or subclinical bleeding that blocks CSF absorption by arachnoid granulations.\n【47】 The median age at diagnosis is three years . Age at presentation correlates with the location of the tumor. Lateral ventricle tumors are more common in children less than 10 years old, while the fourth ventricle tumors are distributed evenly up to age 50 years .\n【48】 Imaging – On CT scan, choroid plexus papillomas are often calcified and enhance with contrast; they may be difficult to differentiate from ependymomas, although the latter do not typically have significant calcification. MRI may reveal flow voids, reflecting tumor vascularity. The noncalcified parts of the papilloma are hypo- to isointense compared with parenchyma on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images (image 8). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may demonstrate enlarged choroidal arteries . There are no MRI features that distinguish grade 1 from grade 2 papillomas.\n【49】 Pathology and genetics – Histologically, choroid plexus papillomas contain a uniform cell population, without significant cytologic atypia. The MIB-1 labeling index is less than 2 percent for grade 1 tumors, indicating a low growth fraction. Most exhibit apical microvilli and scatted cilia, which exhibit a microtubule configuration characteristic of neuroepithelial cells. Atypical choroid plexus papillomas are distinguished from grade 1 tumors primarily by a higher mitotic rate (≥2 mitoses per 10 HPF) . Driver genetic alterations are largely absent; tumor protein p53 (TP53) alterations are more common in choroid plexus carcinomas, and telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations have been identified in a minority of papillomas, mostly in adults . In some children, choroid plexus papillomas occur in association with Aicardi syndrome .\n【50】 Treatment and prognosis – Treatment for large or symptomatic choroid plexus papillomas is resection; small, asymptomatic suspected papillomas can be monitored conservatively without any treatment and only intervened upon if they enlarge. After complete resection, these tumors seldom recur. Even subtotally resected tumors usually have a benign course, although malignant transformation to choroid plexus carcinoma has been reported . Adjuvant radiation therapy is not indicated but may be useful for recurrent tumors that are inoperable . Leptomeningeal seeding may occur with histologically benign tumors .\n【51】 The results of treatment are illustrated by a meta-analysis that included 353 patients with choroid plexus papillomas. Patients who underwent a gross total resection had a 10-year survival rate of 85 percent, compared with 56 percent in those managed with subtotal resections . In another series of 23 patients with choroid plexus papilloma, median event-free survival was 7.6 years . Two patients had recurrence requiring re-resection and adjuvant therapy.\n【52】 Atypical choroid plexus papillomas recur at higher rates; in a series of 92 patients with choroid plexus tumors, the five-year event-free survival rate was 92 percent in patients with grade 1 tumors compared with 83 percent in patients with grade 2 tumors .\n【53】 Imaging – On imaging, choroid plexus carcinomas are more heterogeneous than choroid plexus papillomas due to areas of necrosis and parenchymal invasion (image 9). T2-hyperintense signal may be present in the surrounding white matter, suggesting vasogenic edema .\n【54】 The differential diagnosis includes metastatic adenocarcinoma (especially in adults), teratoma (especially in young male patients), and medulloepithelioma (especially in infants). The presence of multifocal areas of tumor with normal-appearing choroid plexus is more likely to be metastatic disease rather than multifocal choroid plexus carcinoma .\n【55】 Pathology and genetics – Histologically, choroid plexus carcinomas are characterized by dense cellularity, mitoses, nuclear pleomorphism, focal necrosis, loss of papillary architecture, and invasion of brain. Approximately 40 percent of choroid plexus carcinomas are a manifestation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which is due to mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. In a multi-institution study of 64 patients with either choroid plexus papillomas or carcinomas, germline mutations of TP53 were present in all cases of carcinoma in which LFS was diagnosed based upon clinical criteria . By contrast, such germline mutations were absent in all those without LFS.   \"Li-Fraumeni syndrome\".)\n【56】 Treatment and prognosis – The invasiveness of choroid plexus carcinomas typically precludes gross total surgical resection. Prognosis is poor, with a median survival of approximately 2.5 to 3 years . The presence of a TP53 mutation by immunohistochemistry has been associated with worse outcomes .\n【57】 There are no randomized trials assessing the role of chemotherapy or radiation therapy following surgical resection. Adjuvant radiation appears to be beneficial based on retrospective series, but many patients are too young to receive radiation safely . A meta-analysis that included 347 patients with choroid plexus carcinoma reported in the literature observed an improved survival rate among those given multiagent chemotherapy after an incomplete resection (median survival 2.75 versus 0.58 years) .\n【58】 Similarly, a review of the literature suggested that craniospinal irradiation (CSI) was associated with improved survival compared with more limited fields . However, given the association of choroid plexus carcinomas and LFS, it is worthwhile to consider the potential risk of radiation-induced second malignancies in weighing the benefit of craniospinal radiation. Limited data suggest that multiagent intensive chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue with deferred radiation may be a reasonable strategy in young children .\n【59】 Clinical features – CNS ATRTs are highly malignant, WHO grade 4 tumors primarily occurring in young children less than three years old . Approximately two-thirds of ATRTs occur in the cerebellum, typically in the cerebellopontine angle, with invasion of surrounding structures. The remaining cases are supratentorial or multifocal.\n【60】 Infants often present with lethargy and vomiting; older children may have symptoms due to involvement of cranial nerves IV, VI, or VII, such as head tilt, diplopia, or facial weakness. Hemiplegia and/or headaches may also be present .\n【61】 Imaging – ATRTs are usually hypointense on T1-weighted MRI and iso- or hypointense on T2-weighted images. They have heterogeneous enhancement and may have internal cystic areas or hemorrhage (image 10). Leptomeningeal disease may be suggested by linear and nodular enhancement along the meninges around the spinal cord and cauda equina. Imaging cannot reliably differentiate ATRTs from medulloblastoma or other embryonal tumors.   \"Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and risk stratification of medulloblastoma\", section on 'Differential diagnosis'.)\n【62】 Pathology and genetics – Histologically, ATRTs are characterized by rhabdoid cells and are similar to that of other small round blue cell tumors; up to 70 percent also contain fields typical of primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) cells. Necrosis and a high rate of mitotic activity are common. Germ cell markers are negative.\n【63】 Diagnosis of ATRT requires either loss of INI1 nuclear staining, which is indicative of biallelic inactivation of SMARCB1 on chromosome 22, or loss of BRG1 staining, which is indicative of SMARCA4 inactivation. In addition to these somatic mutations detected in tumor tissue, approximately one-third of patients harbor germline mutations in SMARCB1  or, less commonly, SMARCA4 .   \"Schwannomatoses related to genetic variants other than NF2\", section on 'Pathogenesis'.)\n【64】 With advanced molecular analysis, three main molecular subgroups have been identified, denoted as ATRT-TYR, ATRT-SHH, and ATRT-MYC . ATRT-TYR tumors are characterized by tyrosinase (TYR) overexpression, upregulation of the melanosomal pathway, and young age at onset. ATRT-SHH tumors have overexpression of both sonic hedgehog signaling molecule (SHH) and the Notch pathway; further subtyping distinguishes between supratentorial and infratentorial location. The ATRT-MYC subgroup is characterized by elevated expression of the MYC oncogene as well as homeobox C (HOXC) cluster genes.\n【65】 Treatment and prognosis – Surgery, multiagent chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are indicated for the majority of patients , but decisions about use, timing, and fields of radiotherapy are individualized because of the young age of most patients at presentation . The order and components of therapy are tailored to age, tumor location, and extent of disease . Given the rarity of the disease and the complexity of treating infants and young children, participation in clinical trials is encouraged, and there is no consensus on the optimal chemotherapy regimen.\n【66】 Targeted therapies are also under investigation in a myriad of early-phase trials, and a large number of compounds have potential therapeutic activity . In particular, the aurora kinase A inhibitor, alisertib, showed significant antitumor activity in a case series of four children with recurrent or progressive ATRT .\n【67】 The prognosis of ATRT is worse than that associated with medulloblastoma, with a median survival of 12 to 24 months and five-year overall survival of 30 to 40 percent . Patients with germline mutations in SMARCB1 tend to be younger and may have worse survival compared with those with sporadic tumors, although evidence is conflicting . Factors variably associated with improved prognosis include localized disease at the time of presentation and resection .\n【68】 Clinical features – ETMRs affect young children, with a median age of onset of approximately two to three years and a slight female predominance . ETMRs most commonly arise in the supratentorial compartment, often in the frontal or parietotemporal lobes. Approximately 20 percent of tumors arise in the cerebellum, and approximately 20 percent involve the midline, brainstem, or rarely spinal cord . Approximately one-quarter of patients have disseminated or metastatic disease at the time of presentation. Patients may present with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure or focal neurologic signs.\n【69】 Imaging – On MRI, tumors are typically large, well-circumscribed masses that enhance after contrast administration. Internal cysts and calcification may be present. Their nonspecific appearance does not allow them to be distinguished from other malignant brain tumors radiographically.\n【70】 Pathology and genetics – Histopathologically, the characteristic C19MC gene alterations (a micro-RNA cluster) can be detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Immunohistochemical staining for LIN28A supports the diagnosis of ETMR but is not specific. Tumors previously labeled embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (ETANTR) , ependymoblastoma , and medulloepithelioma  are all included in this group, provided they have evidence of C19MC amplification.\n【71】 A hereditary predisposition due to germline mutations in DICER1 has been identified in a small subset of patients with ETMRs (<5 percent), exclusively in tumors lacking C19MC amplification but otherwise molecularly similar to other ETMRs .\n【72】 Treatment and prognosis – ETMRs are aggressive tumors associated with a poor prognosis and median survival of less than one year . A combined-modality approach including maximal surgical resection plus high-dose chemotherapy and age-adapted radiation therapy may result in prolonged survival in some cases . Molecular and preclinical data suggest that targeting of aberrant micro-RNA processing with topoisomerase 1 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition may be an effective strategy .\n【73】 Clinical features – CNS embryonal tumors NEC/NOS are quite rare, even among embryonal tumors. CNS PNETs were estimated to account for less than 5 percent of embryonal tumors. Most occur in infants and children, but adult cases are seen.\n【74】 Older children typically have signs of increased intracranial pressure (eg, headache, nausea, vomiting), while infants present with lethargy, irritability, anorexia, and/or an enlarging head circumference. Other presenting symptoms can include seizures or focal deficits referable to the tumor location. Patients can also present with leptomeningeal dissemination, manifested by signs of cranial nerve palsies, encephalopathy, or spinal cord symptoms.   \"Clinical features and diagnosis of leptomeningeal disease from solid tumors\", section on 'Clinical features'.)\n【75】 Imaging – CT imaging usually reveals a well-defined hemispheric mass, which commonly contains calcification and necrotic areas. Intratumoral hemorrhage may be present. MRI demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement with hypointense regions correlating to hemosiderin or calcification; T1-hyperintense regions correspond to hemorrhage and T2 bright regions reflect cystic components. There is a relative absence of peritumoral edema .\n【76】 Pathology and genetics – CNS embryonal tumors are malignant, highly cellular tumors composed of sheets of densely packed immature cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio . Mitotic activity is typically high. They correspond to a WHO grade of at least 3, but due to changes in nomenclature and heterogeneity within the subtype, distinction between grades 3 and 4 based on pathologic features grade is not yet possible. Molecular drivers have not yet been identified.\n【77】 Treatment and prognosis – Management of CNS PNET has traditionally included aggressive surgical resection followed immediately by radiation therapy to the neuraxis . The results of this treatment approach were illustrated by a combined report of two prospective trials that included 63 children with PNETs . Using a total dose to the neuraxis of 35.2 Gy and a boost of 20 Gy to the primary tumor site, the three-year progression-free survival was 49 percent in children who completed the planned course of therapy, compared with 7 percent in those with major deviations from their planned course of radiation therapy.\n【78】 Adjuvant chemotherapy may further improve survival, but the optimal chemotherapy approach is not known. Chemotherapy regimens for PNETs have utilized chemotherapy agents similar to those for medulloblastomas and have been evaluated in a large trial with mixed patient populations .   \"Treatment and prognosis of medulloblastoma\".)\n【79】 Management of infants and children ≤3 years of age, who are at high risk for severe neurologic impairment if their initial treatment includes craniospinal radiation therapy, is particularly challenging. Small studies utilizing prolonged multiagent induction chemotherapy have been disappointing, with five-year overall survival rates ranging from 15 to 30 percent . High-dose chemotherapy regimens appear more promising, with one study reporting five-year event-free and overall survival rates of 39 and 49 percent, respectively, in 43 patients with CNS PNET or pineoblastoma .\n【80】 Despite aggressive combined-modality treatment, recurrence is fairly common, often occurring in the early posttreatment phase. The reported three-year survival rate has ranged from 57 to 73 percent with regimens that include radiation . These studies may underestimate overall survival, however; in the COG study in which methylation profiling was used to reclassify patients with PNET, five-year overall survival was 78 percent when PNETs/pineoblastomas were considered separately from tumors molecularly reclassified as high-grade glioma, ATRT, or ependymoma . Children younger than three years have a worse prognosis.\n【81】 The treatment of CNS embryonal tumor NEC/NOS in adults consists of a combination of surgery, craniospinal irradiation (CSI), and adjuvant chemotherapy, based upon the approach in older children and children with medulloblastoma.\n【82】 Clinical features – CNS SFTs are rare, dural-based tumors accounting for less than 1 percent of all primary CNS tumors. The median age at diagnosis is 49 to 53 years . The distribution within the CNS is similar to that of meningiomas, with 70 percent supratentorial, 15 percent in the posterior fossa, and 15 percent spinal. Intraventricular lesions have also been reported .\n【83】 Presenting symptoms vary based on location and size and may include headache, focal deficits, or seizures. Extracranial metastatic disease can occur, most commonly in bone, lung, and liver .\n【84】 Imaging – CT imaging often reveals a hyperdense extra-axial mass lesion with focal areas of hypodensity; there is heterogeneous enhancement. Bone erosion can be detected, but hyperostosis usually does not occur. MRI demonstrates T1 and T2 isointensity with flow voids; there is heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement (image 11). In approximately one-half of cases there is a dural tail sign. There may also be a \"corkscrew\" vascular configuration. Peritumoral edema is often present. However, imaging features are nonspecific and do not reliably distinguish between SFT and meningioma.\n【85】 Pathology and genetics – SFTs are composed of spindled to ovoid monomorphic cells amidst hyalinized, thin-walled blood vessels. There is a wide histologic spectrum ranging from a hypocellular phenotype to highly cellular, patternless architecture . Detection of STAT6 nuclear expression by immunohistochemistry or confirmation of NAB2-STAT6 fusion is recommended to confirm the diagnosis. Molecular pathogenesis of the NAB2-STAT6 fusion gene is discussed in more detail separately.   \"Solitary fibrous tumor\", section on 'Molecular pathogenesis and molecular diagnostics'.)\n【86】 CNS World Health Organization (WHO) grades 1 to 3 are assigned based on mitotic activity and necrosis, which correlate with prognosis :\n【87】 Of note, this grading scheme for CNS SFT is new as of the 2021 revision of the WHO classification of CNS tumors, is based on retrospective data, and has not been validated prospectively as a means of making treatment decisions . It also differs from risk stratification models used for extracranial SFT, which are discussed separately.   \"Solitary fibrous tumor\", section on 'Risk stratification models'.)\n【88】 Treatment and prognosis – Initial management consists of maximal safe resection. Gross total resection is associated with improved recurrence-free survival compared with subtotal resection in most studies, but the risk of local recurrence as well as extracranial metastatic spread for SFTs is higher than that of meningioma, particularly for higher-grade tumors. Systemic staging is appropriate in most cases given the propensity for extracranial spread.\n【89】 For grade 1 SFTs, the prognosis is generally good with surgical resection alone, with a five-year recurrence-free survival greater than 80 percent . Recurrent tumors may be treated by reoperation, radiation therapy, or stereotactic radiosurgery and are associated with reduced survival . Distant metastases have been documented even for grade 1 SFTs.\n【90】 Higher-grade SFTs, including those previously diagnosed as hemangiopericytoma, are more biologically aggressive tumors, with 5- and 10-year recurrence-free survival estimates ranging from 60 to 80 percent and 30 to 60 percent, respectively . Postoperative radiation is therefore suggested in most patients. In observational data consisting of case series, local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival rates appear to be greater when patients receive radiation therapy .\n【91】 In selected cases of recurrent disease following radiation therapy, chemotherapy may be helpful . Novel treatments including antiangiogenic therapies are being evaluated for extracranial SFT  and could also have a role for intracranial disease. One report described a significant radiographic and clinical response to pazopanib, a multitargeted receptor tyrosinase kinase inhibitor that inhibits angiogenesis, in two patients with recurrent meningeal SFT .\n【92】 Fibrosarcoma – Fibrosarcomas are spindle cell tumors composed of malignant fibroblasts on a background of collagen. Approximately 40 cases of primary fibrosarcoma arising within the CNS have been reported. Primary fibrosarcomas are dural based or arise from infolding of the leptomeninges into the parenchyma.\n【93】 Fibrosarcomas can present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, hemiparesis, seizures, and cranial neuropathies if located at the skull base. On MRI, they avidly enhance and may have changes that reflect foci of hemorrhage. CT scan may demonstrate bone destruction or invasion .\n【94】 Primary fibrosarcomas are usually of high histologic grade and have a high rate of local recurrence. Treatment includes surgery and radiation therapy, with or without adjuvant chemotherapy. Despite aggressive therapy, the prognosis is poor . This was illustrated by a series of nine patients with primary CNS fibrosarcomas who were treated with surgery and radiation therapy. Eight patients died with a median survival of 7.5 months, with local recurrence in eight patients and distant recurrence in six patients .\n【95】 Chondrosarcoma – Chondrosarcomas are malignant cartilaginous tumors that account for approximately 6 percent of skull base tumors. There are also case reports of chondrosarcomas arising in the brain parenchyma (image 12) .   \"Chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the skull base\".)\n【96】 Liposarcoma – Primary intracranial liposarcomas are extremely rare, malignant tumors. Liposarcomas range from well differentiated to pleomorphic, with the latter having the worst prognosis. Systemic liposarcomas have been documented to metastasize to the CNS, and this possibility should also be considered in a patient presenting with a CNS liposarcoma .\n【97】 Primary CNS liposarcomas are treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, based upon the approach used to treat extracranial lesions.   \"Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma\", section on 'Introduction'.)\n【98】 Scope – The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) recognizes more than 100 tumor types in 13 different categories. Although most brain tumors in adults are diffuse gliomas, meningiomas, or metastases, the cumulative total of less common brain tumors makes up a significant minority, especially in infants and children.  'Introduction' above.)\n【99】 Clinical presentation and diagnosis – The clinical manifestations of rare brain tumors are determined by the anatomic location, growth rate, and histology.

Many are low-grade, circumscribed, cortically based tumors that are associated with seizures.\n【101】 Circumscribed astrocytic gliomas – Circumscribed astrocytic gliomas are distinguished from diffuse gliomas by a localized growth pattern, with absent or minimal infiltration of surrounding brain parenchyma\n【102】 Choroid plexus tumors – Tumors arising from the choroid plexus range from low-grade, hamartomatous papillomas to malignant carcinomas of the choroid plexus. Choroid plexus carcinomas can be a manifestation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in the tumor protein p53 (TP53) gene.  'Choroid plexus tumors' above.)\n【103】 Rare embryonal tumors – Embryonal tumors are highly malignant tumors of the CNS that affect infants and young children. Several rare tumors in this category are now genetically defined, including embryonal tumor with multilayered rosettes (ETMR), associated with alterations in the chromosome 19 microRNA cluster (C19MC), and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT), defined by inactivation of SMARCB1 or SMARCA4\n【104】 Mesenchymal tumors – Mesenchymal, nonmeningothelial tumors originating in the CNS represent a spectrum of benign and malignant tumors that arise more commonly in the meninges than the brain parenchyma\n【105】 Primary melanocytic lesions – Proliferation of melanocytes derived from the neural crest can result in a range of both diffuse and localized, benign and malignant melanocytic processes involving the leptomeninges.

It is a disease of morbidity, not mortality. It is most frequently encountered in mountaineers and other cold weather enthusiasts, soldiers, those who work in the cold, the homeless, and individuals stranded outdoors in the winter . Among patients with severe frostbite, timely diagnosis and treatment is essential to maximize tissue salvage.\n【2】 This topic review will discuss the classification, presentation, diagnosis, and management of frostbite. Severe hypothermia, high altitude illness, and other related illnesses are discussed separately.\n【3】 DEFINITIONS — Frostbite is a severe, localized cold-induced injury due to freezing of tissue. Immersion foot (also referred to as trench foot) is a nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) that may also cause tissue loss and long-term sequelae. Milder forms of injury include frostnip and pernio:\n【4】 Frostnip refers to cold-induced, localized paresthesias that resolve with rewarming. There is no permanent tissue damage.\n【5】 Pernio, or chilblains, is characterized by localized inflammatory lesions that can result from acute or repetitive exposure to damp cold above the freezing point. Lesions are edematous, often reddish or purple, and may be very painful or pruritic . Pernio is most common in young women, but both sexes and all age ranges may be affected . Permanent damage from pernio is uncommon, with symptoms and signs generally resolving within two to three weeks.\n【6】 Immersion foot (or trench foot) involves injury to the sympathetic nerves and vasculature of the feet. It was first described in 1914 during World War I trench warfare. It results from prolonged exposure of the feet to a combination of dampness and cold. Tight-fitting boots exacerbate the condition. Feet and occasionally hands are red, edematous, can be numb or extremely painful, and, in severe cases, can be covered with hemorrhagic bullae\n【7】 Improved foot hygiene including better boot design and frequent sock changes resulted in a much lower prevalence among soldiers by 1917. Not just of historical significance, immersion foot was a major medical issue during the Falklands War of 1982 and still occurs, especially among the homeless .\n【8】 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY — The tissue destruction of frostbite is due to both immediate cold-induced cell death and the more gradual development of reperfusion-related localized inflammatory processes and tissue ischemia. Following exposure to subfreezing temperatures, ice crystals form extracellularly. If freezing is rapid, ice crystals may also form inside cells. Fluid and electrolyte fluxes cause lysis of cell membranes with subsequent cell death. An inflammatory process ensues mediated by thromboxane A2, prostaglandin F2-alpha, bradykinins, and histamine. This leads to tissue ischemia and necrosis. The initial cellular damage and the subsequent inflammatory processes are made worse in the setting of thawing followed by refreezing of the affected area .\n【9】 CLASSIFICATION — A number of systems to classify frostbite have been developed based on initial clinical presentation, findings on scintigraphy with technetium-99m pertechnetate, and outcome .\n【10】 One classification scheme categorizes frostbite injuries as superficial or deep. As described below, superficial frostbite corresponds to first and second-degree injury, while deep frostbite corresponds to third and fourth-degree injury .\n【11】 A more useful clinical prediction tool has been developed for frostbite of the hands and feet, based on the level at which skin lesions are noted after rapid rewarming in warm water. The categories are as follow :\n【12】 Grade 1 frostbite is characterized by no cyanosis on the extremity . This predicts no amputation and no sequelae.\n【13】 Grade 2 involves cyanosis isolated to the distal phalanx . This predicts only soft tissue amputation and fingernail or toenail sequelae.\n【14】 Grade 3 frostbite is characterized by intermediate and proximal phalangeal cyanosis . This predicts bone amputation of the digit and functional sequelae.\n【15】 Grade 4 frostbite involves cyanosis over the carpal or tarsal bones . This predicts bone amputation of the limb with functional sequelae .\n【16】 The traditional classification system divides frostbite into four degrees of severity based upon the depth of tissue involvement, in similar fashion to the classification of burns:\n【17】 First-degree frostbite is very superficial and is characterized by a central area of pallor and anesthesia of the skin surrounded by edema.\n【18】 Second-degree frostbite is recognized by large blisters containing clear fluid surrounded by edema and erythema, developing within 24 hours and extending to or nearly to the tips of digits . The blisters may form an eschar, but this later sloughs off, revealing healthy granulation tissue. There is no tissue loss.\n【19】 Third-degree frostbite differs from second-degree in that the injury is deeper and the blisters are smaller, hemorrhagic and more proximal. The skin forms a black eschar in one to several weeks .\n【20】 Fourth-degree frostbite, which extends to muscle and bone, involves complete tissue necrosis. Mummification occurs in 4 to 10 days.\n【21】 This traditional system gives clinicians a false sense of accuracy. It has caused many to treat frostbite injuries as if they were burns, with suboptimal results. Depending upon rewarming methods and complications, such as infection or trauma, first and second-degree frostbite can unexpectedly become third or fourth-degree.\n【22】 The Hennepin Score, patterned after total body surface scoring systems for thermal burns, is used for research purposes to describe the extent of tissue involved and quantify tissue salvage rates . It is not a clinical tool.\n【23】 RISK FACTORS — Frostbite generally develops within minutes to hours depending on circumstances and risk factors. Risk factors for developing frostbite and cold-induced injury include any condition that increases localized heat loss or decreases heat production. Examples include increased convective heat loss due to exposure to wind or conductive heat loss due to contact with metal, the ground, or water . Exhaustion, dehydration, malnutrition, or comorbidities such as peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, or mental illness may limit an individual's ability to respond to a cold stress. Alcohol abuse predisposes to frostbite as a result of acute behavioral changes, increased heat loss from vasodilation, and chronic complications of alcohol consumption . Other sedating or judgment-impairing drugs or medications pose a similar risk. Clearly, risk is greater at low ambient temperatures, when wind chill effects are increased, and at higher altitudes .\n【24】 Additional risk factors for developing frostbite include smoking, previous cold injury, and exposure of the hands and arms to vibration, which can elicit a Raynaud phenomenon associated with white fingers in some individuals . Data from the United States Armed Forces suggest that soldiers who are African-American, female, or younger than 20 years of age are at increased risk .\n【25】 Use of clothing that provides inadequate insulation or coverage, or is damp, too tight, or permeable to wind, can predispose to frostbite, as can use of protective ointments, such as on the face. Studies from Norway in the 1990s showed that ointment use can enhance heat loss in some people and can provide users with a false sense of security, causing them to neglect standard safety measures . Excessive sweating of the hands and feet increases an individual's risk of frostbite to those areas, illustrating the importance of clothing that can wick moisture away from the skin .\n【26】 While generally considered a disease associated with environmental exposure to cold, frostbite has also been reported following direct exposure to freezing materials. As an example, the application of ice packs to reduce swelling from musculoskeletal injuries can cause frostbite . It is important to tell patients to interpose a cloth between the ice pack and their skin, and to limit treatment intervals to 20 minutes with a minute or two break between applications. Fingertip contact with a metal surface at a temp of -15°C (5°F) can lead to frostbite within a few seconds .\n【27】 Case reports describe severe facial, upper airway, and esophageal frostbite from recreational inhalation of halogenated hydrocarbons and nitrous oxide . Contact with Freon, a fluorinated hydrocarbon used as a refrigerant, has been reported to cause third and fourth-degree frostbite of the hand . Frostbite of the foot has been described resulting from the discharge of a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher on a sprained ankle in an attempt to reduce edema . Abdominal wall cryolipolysis can cause full thickness tissue loss, likely by frostbite combined with pressure necrosis .\n【28】 Some researchers hypothesize that individual variation in cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) corresponds to the risk of frostbite. The results of one observational study of the Royal Netherlands Navy during arctic training suggested that faster and greater CIVD may decrease risk , but subsequent studies have shown no correlation .\n【29】 EPIDEMIOLOGY — Because there is no formal reporting system for cases of frostbite, data on incidence and prevalence are derived from selected subpopulations, generally consisting of individuals at greater than average risk . Based upon such studies, the areas of the body most susceptible to frostbite appear to be the hands, feet, face (including nose and cheeks), and ears.\n【30】 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS — Areas most frequently affected by frostbite include the ears, nose, cheeks, chin, fingers, and toes\n【31】 DIAGNOSIS — Diagnosis is generally made on clinical grounds, based on the context of the injury, signs, and symptoms. Diagnostic studies–namely bone scanning–are helpful in determining the existence of comorbidities, the extent of frostbite injury, and prognosis. Because frostbite is a disease of morbidity, not mortality, more immediate life-threats, such as coexisting hypothermia, must be identified and addressed first.   \"Accidental hypothermia in adults\".)\n【32】 IMAGING STUDIES — Radiologic studies can help to determine the extent of tissue involvement, response to therapy, and long-term tissue viability . The most important study for patients with signs of or at risk for tissue necrosis from frostbite is technetium (Tc)-99m scintigraphy (ie, bone scan). The appropriate role for each modality is described below:\n【33】 Plain radiographs are not useful initially except to screen for trauma-related fractures. Late (weeks to months) radiographic findings in frostbite include bony destruction and, in children, damage to growth plates . Frostbite arthritis often spares the thumbs, most likely because patients wrap them within clenched fists during the exposure .\n【34】 Standard or digital subtraction angiography can be used to identify patients suitable for thrombolytic therapy . Unlike technetium-99m scintigraphy, angiography does not visualize the microcirculation soon after injury, including in bone.\n【35】 Fluorescence microangiography, a technique that has been used to monitor wound healing, has been used to monitor progression of perfusion in frostbite . A study of 104 frostbite patients, of whom 26 were evaluated with both technetium-99m scanning and microangiography, found that amputation level correlated better with microangiography than with technetium-99m scanning .\n【36】 Technetium (Tc)-99m scintigraphy (ie, bone scan) can be used to identify candidates suitable for thrombolytic therapy . It is also used to predict the long-term viability of affected tissue, with the goal of allowing early debridement or amputation of dead or dying areas while preserving viable tissue . In candidates for treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), technetium scanning is used immediately after thawing. For patients who are not candidates for tPA, technetium scanning on day 2 following injury may avoid the need for the traditional several-week delay in surgical intervention while awaiting demarcation between viable and nonviable zones. Scintigraphy has also been used to monitor response to a topical therapy protocol by demonstrating the effect of treatment on involved tissue microvasculature .\n【37】 Limited retrospective data suggest that single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a nuclear bone scan processed similarly to a computed tomography (CT) scan, combined with conventional CT (SPECT/CT), may be able to identify non-salvageable tissue, allowing more accurate determination of the extent of tissue destruction and autoamputation than a conventional bone scan .\n【38】 Some researchers claim that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may be superior to bone scans in establishing tissue viability. In case reports they have permitted visualization of occluded blood vessels and better demonstrated the line of demarcation between ischemic and nonischemic tissue. However, experience with MRI and MRA in this setting is limited .\n【39】 TREATMENT — Treatment can be divided into prehospital interventions and definitive care. The approach described below is based on animal studies, observational data, clinical experience, and relatively small number of clinical trials. Management of hypothermia is discussed separately.   \"Accidental hypothermia in adults\".)\n【40】 Prehospital care\n【41】 Get the patient to a warm environment as soon as possible. Whenever possible, pad or splint the affected area to minimize injury en route.\n【42】 Remove wet clothing.\n【43】 Avoid walking on frostbitten feet; this can increase tissue damage. If walking is necessary for evacuation, do not rewarm the feet before walking.\n【44】 Do not rewarm frostbitten tissue if there is a possibility of refreezing before reaching definitive care. This would result in worse tissue damage.\n【45】 If prehospital warming is attempted, options include placing the affected area in warm (not hot) water or warming it using body heat (eg, placing frostbitten fingers in the axillae).\n【46】 Do not rub frostbitten areas in an attempt to rewarm them; this can cause further tissue damage.\n【47】 Avoid the use of stoves or fires to rewarm frostbitten tissue. Such tissue may be insensate and burns can result .\n【48】 Hospital-based management — Once the patient has reached the hospital, definitive care consists of rapid rewarming, wound care, efforts to enhance tissue viability, and prevention of complications . Among patients with severe frostbite, timely diagnosis and treatment is essential to maximize limb and digit salvage . Management of other, more serious conditions, such as severe hypothermia or internal hemorrhage from major trauma, takes priority over the treatment of frostbite.   \"Accidental hypothermia in adults\" and  \"Initial management of trauma in adults\".)\n【49】 Rewarming — Rewarming is most effectively accomplished by immersing the affected area in water heated to 37 to 39°C (98.6 to 102.2°F), ideally in a whirlpool so a steady temperature can be maintained . Gentle active motion of the extremity while rewarming may help. Care should also be taken to avoid trauma to the injured area against the container walls during treatment. Higher temperatures do not warm the injured area appreciably faster and cause the warming process to be much more painful. Dry heat is difficult to regulate and is not recommended.\n【50】 Thawing is usually complete when the tissue is red or purple and soft to the touch. This usually takes 15 to 30 minutes. Rewarming of frostbitten tissue may be painful. Appropriate analgesia, generally opioids, should be administered.\n【51】 Time-limited treatments for severe injury\n【52】 Thrombolysis for severe injury presenting within 24 hours\n【53】 Indications and general guidance — Because frostbite is associated with vascular thrombosis of affected tissue, administration of intravenous or intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA; with intravenous or intra-arterial heparin, or subcutaneous enoxaparin) has been used for therapy . Although high-quality evidence is limited, in patients at high risk for life-altering amputation (eg, multiple digits in a limb, multiple limbs, proximal limb amputation), without contraindications to the use of tPA, who present within 24 hours of injury, we suggest treatment with intravenous tPA plus subcutaneous low-molecular weight heparin (eg enoxaparin) or intravenous heparin. The use of intra-arterial tPA with heparin is also reasonable in facilities capable of administering intra-arterial tPA.\n【54】 Hennepin County Medical Center (Minneapolis, USA) has found that treatment with intravenous tPA and subcutaneous enoxaparin is effective and more easily accomplished than treatment with intra-arterial tPA  administration regimens below). Controlled trials comparing intra-arterial and intravenous tPA for the treatment of severe frostbite have not been conducted.\n【55】 The American Burn Association has published guidelines for thrombolytic therapy for frostbite . According to their guidelines, thrombolytic therapy may be used for patients with cyanosis proximal to the distal phalanx (grade 3 or 4 frostbite injury) and demonstrated loss of perfusion at or proximal to the middle phalanx immediately after rewarming.\n【56】 Whenever possible, treatment should be performed at or in consultation with a center experienced in the use of tPA for frostbite. Patients appropriate for treatment with tPA are also appropriate for treatment with iloprost.  'Prostacyclin therapy for severe injury presenting within 48 hours' below.)\n【57】 The degree of frostbite should be assessed using the extent of cyanosis immediately after rewarming, as described in the classification section . Patients with cyanosis proximal to the interphalangeal joints should be evaluated with technetium scanning or CT angiography. If circulation is absent proximal to the interphalangeal joints, tPA should be given, unless contraindicated.  'Classification' above and 'Imaging studies' above.)\n【58】 Risks and contraindications — Thrombolysis is associated with a small but important risk of dangerous bleeding (eg, intracranial hemorrhage). Contraindications to tPA include, but are not limited to, recent stroke or persistent neurologic impairment, intracranial trauma, recent significant gastrointestinal bleeding, and recent surgery. Before administering tPA, clinicians must carefully assess the patient's risk for significant bleeding complications. Do not give tPA to patients at significant risk for such complications, which are summarized in the following table\n【59】 Administration and dosing — There are no standardized dosing regimens for tPA in the treatment of severe frostbite injury. Reasonable approaches are described below.\n【60】 As soon as angiography or technetium-99m scanning shows that there is no perfusion to the affected area(s), intravenous (IV) or intra-arterial tPA should begin as soon as possible, but no longer than 24 hours after thawing.\n【61】 For IV administration of tPA, we suggest the following regimen :\n【62】 Give a bolus dose of 0.15 mg/kg over 15 minutes, followed by a continuous IV infusion of 0.15 mg/kg per hour for six hours. The maximum total dose is 100 mg.\n【63】 After tPA has been given, adjunct treatment can be started with IV heparin or subcutaneous (SC) enoxaparin. The dose of IV heparin is 500 to 1000 units/hour for six hours, or targeted to maintain the partial thromboplastin time (PTT) at twice the control value. Enoxaparin can be given at the therapeutic dose (1 mg/kg SC).\n【64】 For intra-arterial administration of tPA, we suggest the following regimen :\n【65】 Give a bolus of 2 to 4 mg, followed by an infusion of 0.5 to 1 mg/hour via the femoral or brachial artery. Repeat angiograms are performed every 8 to 12 hours.\n【66】 A few centers give an intra-arterial vasodilator, most commonly papaverine (150 mg), immediately before administering intra-arterial tPA .\n【67】 If more than one extremity is affected, divide the total tPA dose between or among them. Treatment should be continued until perfusion is restored (as demonstrated by angiography or technetium-99m scanning) or a time limit of 72 hours is reached.\n【68】 Adjunct treatment with heparin can be given at 500 units/hour via the intra-arterial catheter.\n【69】 Hennepin County Medical Center, a facility with extensive experience managing frostbite, uses the following thrombolytic protocol:\n【70】 Rapidly rewarm frostbitten tissue in warm (not hot) water until it can be assessed for the presence of hemorrhagic blisters or acral hypoperfusion (cyanosis).  'Rewarming' above.)\n【71】 Perform a technetium-99m triple-phase bone scan. Patients expected to require significant amputations due to tissue necrosis and who have undergone rewarming within 12 hours injury, without freeze-thaw cycles (ie, repeated episodes of refreezing and thawing), are eligible for thrombolysis in the absence of contraindications.\n【72】 For suitable patients at risk for tissue necrosis and with no contraindications, administer a loading dose of alteplase, 0.15 mg/kg intravenously over 15 minutes. Following the loading dose, start an infusion of alteplase, 0.15 mg/kg per hour for 6 hours. (While earlier reports involved intra-arterial administration of tPA and heparin, the Hennepin experience has been that the intravenous route for tPA is also effective and more easily accomplished.)\n【73】 Perform another technetium-99m triple-phase bone scan to verify reperfusion.\n【74】 After treatment with alteplase is completed, begin treatment with enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg subcutaneously, given twice daily for 14 days.\n【75】 Clinicians must discuss the relative risks and benefits of thrombolytic treatment with the patient and obtain informed consent. Treatment with thrombolytics assumes the patient is willing to accept a small risk of potentially catastrophic bleeding in return for a greater likelihood of retaining functional digits or limbs. Rates of tissue salvage improve with decreasing time from rewarming to thrombolysis .\n【76】 Evidence in support of thrombolytic treatment of severe frostbite is largely observational but growing :\n【77】 In a systematic review, data were extracted from 16 studies and case series involving a total of 209 patients with 1109 digits at risk for amputation from frostbite and treated with thrombolytic therapy using either intra-arterial or intravenous tPA . The salvage rate for digits treated with intra-arterial tPA (n = 926) was 76 percent, while the salvage rate for digits treated with intravenous tPA (n = 63) was 62 percent. Although statistical analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity among the studies, it may well be that there is no significant statistical or clinical difference in digit salvage rate between intravenous and intra-arterial tPA. Digital subtraction angiography was used for the initial evaluation in nine studies, and triple-phase bone scan was used in six. While patient characteristics and study inclusion criteria varied, the authors of the review noted that thrombolytic therapy was less effective in patients with prolonged exposure (longer than 24 hours) or freeze-thaw-refreeze injuries.\n【78】 Another systematic review assessed 17 studies involving a total of 1844 limbs and digits with frostbite in 325 patients, 216 of whom were treated with thrombolysis . This review included studies using a number of thrombolytic agents. While limb salvage rates varied from 0 to 100 percent among studies, the weighted average was 79 percent.\n【79】 The administration of papaverine, a vasodilator, followed by tPA has been associated with good patient outcomes in case reports . However, a controlled trial of tPA with and without papaverine has yet to be performed. Nitroglycerin has also been used as a vasodilator to facilitate treatment with intra-arterial tPA .\n【80】 Prostacyclin therapy for severe injury presenting within 48 hours — Prostacyclin, a vasodilator, shows promise for the treatment of frostbite. Iloprost, a prostacyclin analog (IV formulation not available in the United States), was associated with lower amputation rates among 47 patients treated for severe frostbite compared to those treated with buflomedil in an open label randomized trial , and additional case reports of successful treatment with iloprost have been published .\n【81】 We suggest treatment with iloprost, with or without tPA, for patients with severe frostbite (Grade 2-4) if given within 48 hours of the initial insult . Iloprost administration may be effective past 48 hours, perhaps up to 72 hours (eg, if a clear history or timeline cannot be established), but supporting data are limited . When used without tPA, administration of iloprost does not require an intensive care setting, nor does it require radiologic intervention. Iloprost should be used alone when tPA is contraindicated, as in frostbite\n【82】 The use of iloprost is safe enough that it can be used in prehospital settings if evacuation to hospital is not feasible . The dosing regimen is the same, but the infusion is stopped after a total of 50 mcg (one vial) has been given, regardless of the weight of the patient. The patient should be evacuated after the first dose, but if this is not practical, the dose can be repeated daily for a total of three days. A single dose is likely beneficial and should be given even if it is not possible to give subsequent doses.\n【83】 Wound care — Subsequent management includes application of a bulky dressing to the affected area, elevation to reduce edema, and daily hydrotherapy to improve range of motion. Splinting may be required to prevent contracture formation.\n【84】 The following practices are important in treating these wounds:\n【85】 Maintain aseptic technique during wound treatment.\n【86】 Apply nonadherent gauze as the first dressing layer.\n【87】 Use sterile fluff dressing.\n【88】 Insert pledgets (eg, sterile cotton) between digits to prevent tissue maceration during demarcation.\n【89】 Avoid occlusive dressings.\n【90】 Protect lower extremity wounds with a cradle and upper extremity wounds with sterile sheets.\n【91】 Keep wounds open immediately following water bath or whirlpool treatment and allow them to dry before applying any dressing.\n【92】 Blisters – There is no clear consensus on management of frostbite-induced blisters. Some authors suggest that because of the high concentrations of inflammatory mediators in the blister fluid, all should be drained. Others take a more conservative approach. A reasonable compromise is to drain, debride, and bandage large nonhemorrhagic bullae that interfere with movement, such as those over joints. Hemorrhagic bullae of comparable size and location are drained by aspiration but are NOT debrided. Hemorrhagic bullae reflect more significant damage to the microvasculature. Other minor bullae should be left intact .\n【93】 Topical aloe, applied with dressing changes, and oral ibuprofen (adult dose 400 to 600 mg every 12 hours) or aspirin (adult dose 325 mg daily) may limit inflammation associated with frostbite by inhibiting thromboxane and prostaglandins, although supporting evidence is limited . In the absence of contraindications, it is reasonable to use these treatments .\n【94】 Infection prophylaxis\n【95】 Tetanus is a reported complication of frostbite. Tetanus prophylaxis is recommended .\n【96】 Prophylactic antibiotics are controversial, and little evidence exists to guide decision-making. Post-thaw daily or twice daily warm whirlpool treatments are standard therapy to help to reduce bacterial colonization of injured tissue, but infection can develop nevertheless. We do not recommend routine use of prophylactic antibiotics. We suggest giving parenteral antibiotics at the earliest sign of infection. Staphylococci, streptococci, and pseudomonas species should be covered. Topical antibiotics can cause maceration and should be avoided; if given, antibiotics should be administered intravenously. Appropriate antibiotic selection is discussed separately.   \"Acute cellulitis and erysipelas in adults: Treatment\", section on 'Acute cellulitis'.)\n【97】 Surgical consultation — Because frostbite may require long-term wound care, including hydrotherapy, repeated tissue debridement, escharotomy, fasciotomy, and possibly delayed amputation, we recommend early surgical consultation, preferably with an orthopedic surgeon with experience managing frostbite .\n【98】 Unproven therapies: Hyperbaric oxygen, pentoxifylline, heparin without thrombolysis, and others — Several potential but unproven treatments for frostbite have been reported. Hyperbaric oxygen has been proposed as an adjunctive therapy to improve revascularization and healing of injured tissue. Older studies showed no benefit, but subsequent case reports suggest a possible role and describe improvement in symptoms and the microcirculation of affected tissues . A retrospective case series of 22 patients reported no definite improvement in the extent of amputations from hyperbaric oxygen therapy . Further study of hyperbaric treatment is needed before it can be recommended. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is discussed in greater detail separately.   \"Hyperbaric oxygen therapy\".)\n【99】 There is no evidence that intravenous heparin alone improves outcomes in frostbite. We do not recommend such treatment. For appropriately selected patients, heparin, or enoxaparin, is given along with thrombolytic therapy.  'Thrombolysis for severe injury presenting within 24 hours' above.)\n【100】 COMPLICATIONS\n【101】 Overview of short and longer term complications — The complications of frostbite are due primarily to peripheral neurovascular injury with associated abnormalities of sympathetic tone. Vasospasm, especially with re-exposure to cold, is common and may be permanent. The severity of complications generally correlates with the severity of the original injury. The sequelae of nonfreezing cold injuries (NFCIs) are similar but often more debilitating than those produced by frostbite .\n【102】 Short-term complications include gangrene and infection of the affected area . Autoamputation may take many weeks to occur. Therapeutic amputation is necessary if deep infection develops before the autoamputation of nonviable tissue. Rarely, acute compartment syndrome may develop and require emergency decompression.\n【103】 Throbbing pain that begins two to three days after rewarming may persist for weeks or months, even after nonviable tissue demarcates. Intermittent paresthesias beginning after one week are thought to be due to ischemic neuritis and may last for months. Burning, electric shock sensations may also occur. Hyperhidrosis is common and may be a cause as well as an effect of frostbite.\n【104】 Cold exposure is contraindicated for six months after minor injury and for at least 12 months after any significant cold injury. Special precautions to protect previously injured tissue may need to be taken for several years if not indefinitely to prevent further damage.  'Prevention' below.)\n【105】 Longer-term complications include hypersensitivity to the cold; patients remain at increased risk for developing frostbite . Late and long-term or permanent sequelae include scarring, tissue atrophy, arthritis, bony abnormalities, and peripheral neuropathy, including hyper or hypoesthesia of digits with decreased proprioception and chronic pain. Pediatric patients may develop necrosis of epiphyses, with devastating growth abnormalities.  'Complications in children' below.)\n【106】 Frostbite osteoarthritis — Osteoarthritis caused by frostbite occurs most often in the distal extremities. There are numerous case reports of frostbite arthritis of hands in adults, usually not associated with loss of soft tissue. Early changes can include flexion contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joints that may improve over several months or become permanent, sometimes with arthrodesis . Joint swelling may also be permanent and associated with osteo-degenerative changes and juxta-articular swelling of the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints  . In spite of any deformities, good functional outcomes are common . The thumbs are usually spared in frostbite arthritis, in contrast to typical osteoarthritis .\n【107】 Frostbite arthritis of the feet causing flexion contractures of the toes has been reported . Functional outcomes can be good  or debilitating . Frostbite arthritis can occur in patients with underlying connective tissue disorders, such as scleroderma or Sjögren's disease, producing a confusing clinical picture, especially if a history of frostbite is not elicited .\n【108】 Frostbite arthritis has been known for centuries but was first described in modern times in a case series of 100 American soldiers who sustained frostbite injuries, primarily in their feet, while in Korea during 1950 to 1951 . Transient, mostly mild osteoporosis developed in 58 soldiers. Subsequent changes to the bone consisting of sharply defined, punched out defects, usually near joints, were seen in 7 of 62 soldiers who were observed for at least eight months. There was no correlation between the severity of frostbite and the changes in the joints. Only one soldier had long-term clinical sequelae.\n【109】 Complications in children — Epiphyseal destruction, bone abnormalities, and arthritis are potential sequelae after frostbite of the hands, and occasionally feet, in children . Frostbite need not be severe in order to be associated with damage to the digits. Most reported cases did not involve loss of tissue. Loss of fingernails with subsequent regrowth of normal nails often occurs during the several weeks following injury . Multiple nails can be lost with regrowth over months to years . Sometimes, there is sloughing of the epidermis without permanent tissue loss .\n【110】 Bone and joint changes usually begin to become evident several months after frostbite injury. Epiphyseal abnormalities, primarily of the distal and middle phalanges, include partial or complete destruction, fragmentation, and premature fusion  . Swan neck deformities can also occur . Deep frostbite injuries with loss of tissue can cause severe sequelae with markedly limited range of motion of hands or feet .\n【111】 Frostbite sustained at a young age can result in severe, progressive deformity with decreased range of motion and weakness in extension . Chronic circulatory changes can include cold intolerance and vasomotor instability . Deformities often worsen during growth spurts when affected bones fail to grow while unaffected bones develop normally . When patients reach adulthood, radiographs show less specific changes of chronic arthritis with short phalanges . Their hands often have limited dexterity, which can interfere with fine motor skills such as dressing and using a keyboard .\n【112】 There are no specific data to guide treatment of frostbite in children. We recommend treating frostbite in children as for adults. There is no treatment proven to prevent permanent sequelae affecting bones and joints. In the largest published case series (13 patients , none sought surgery to improve function or appearance due to chronic disability .\n【113】 PREVENTION — Prevention of frostbite includes minimizing predisposing factors, paying attention to weather forecasts, dressing appropriately for the weather, and having an emergency plan when venturing to remote regions .\n【114】 Alcohol consumption and smoking should be avoided, as should exposure to water or metal surfaces.\n【115】 Adequate calorie intake and hydration should be maintained.\n【116】 Predicted high and low temperatures should be noted, as well as forecasted precipitation and wind chill index. In the setting of extreme cold temperature and high winds, frostbite can develop in a matter of minutes .\n【117】 Suggested clothing includes a hat, face protection, eye protection under extreme conditions, mittens (as opposed to gloves), warm and water-resistant shoes, and several layers of loose-fitting clothes. The innermost layer should be a wicking material, such as polypropylene, that will draw moisture away from the skin. The next layer should be of an insulating material such as fleece or wool. The outer-most layer should provide protection against wind, rain, and snow. Wet clothing should be changed as soon as is feasible .\n【118】 Small chemical heat packs may be placed in gloves or shoes but should be used with caution to avoid burns through direct contact with the skin.\n【119】 The practice of applying emollients to exposed skin to prevent frostbite is widespread in many cold regions of the world. However, literature supporting this practice is lacking. In fact, there is some evidence that this may give the user a false sense of security and increase the risk of frostbite. Therefore, we do not suggest the use of emollients as a preventative measure .\n【120】 Individuals traveling in remote areas should, prior to departure, inform others of their anticipated route and carry adequate emergency supplies in case they become stranded.\n【121】 Persons frequently exposed to cold environments should be aware of common frostbite symptoms and signs, and should withdraw to warm shelter when these are noticed.\n【122】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Management of environmental emergencies\".)\n【123】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients. (You can also locate patient education articles on a variety of subjects by searching on “patient info” and the keyword(s) of interest.)\n【124】 Basics topic   \"\n【125】 Classification and risk factors – Risk factors for frostbite or nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) include anything that increases localized heat loss or decreases heat production. Examples include increased convective heat loss due to exposure to wind or conductive heat loss due to contact with metal or water. Exhaustion, dehydration, malnutrition, alcohol abuse, or comorbidities such as peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, or mental illness also increase risk. The classification of frostbite and other risk factors are discussed in the text.  'Classification' above and 'Risk factors' above and 'Definitions' above.)\n【126】 Clinical manifestations – The areas most frequently affected by frostbite include the ears, nose, cheeks, chin, fingers, and toes. Patients often complain of cold, numbness, and clumsiness of the affected area. The skin may be insensate, white or grayish-yellow in color, and hard or waxy to touch. Bullae containing clear or hemorrhagic fluid may form after thawing.  'Clinical manifestations' above and 'Diagnosis' above.)\n【127】 Imaging – Technetium-99m scintigraphy (bone scan) can be used to predict long-term viability of affected tissue and help guide decisions about thrombolytic therapy. Other imaging methods (eg, fluorescence microangiography; magnetic resonance angiography) may also be useful for this purpose, but evidence is limited.  'Diagnosis' above.)\n【128】 Initial care and rewarming – Prehospital and hospital care of frostbite is described in detail in the text. Rapid rewarming, meticulous sterile wound care, possible thrombolysis, and early surgical consultation are key interventions. Rewarming is most effectively accomplished by immersing the affected area in a water bath heated to 37 to 39°C. Such water feels warm but not hot to an unaffected hand.  'Treatment' above.)\n【129】 Tetanus prophylaxis and early, aggressive treatment of possible infection should be provided. Prophylactic antibiotics are not routinely recommended.  'Infection prophylaxis' above.)\n【130】 Thrombolysis and anticoagulation therapy – In patients at high risk for life-altering amputation (eg, multiple digits in a limb, multiple limbs, proximal amputation), without contraindications to the use of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)  may be administered instead of IV heparin.\n【131】 Whenever possible, treatment should be performed at or in consultation with a center experienced in the use of tPA for frostbite. Clinicians must discuss the relative risks and benefits of thrombolytic treatment with the patient and obtain informed consent. Treatment with thrombolytics assumes the patient is willing to accept a small risk of potentially catastrophic bleeding in return for a greater likelihood of retaining functional digits or limbs. Dosing regimens are provided in the text.  'Thrombolysis for severe injury presenting within 24 hours' above.)\n【132】 Prostacyclin therapy – For patients who present with significant frostbite (Grades 2 to 4) within 48 hours of the initial insult, we suggest treatment with iloprost, a synthetic form of prostacyclin (Grade 2B). Iloprost is given by intravenous infusion at a dose 0.5 nanogram/kg per minute, increased every 30 minutes by 0.5 nanogram/kg per minute, to a maximum of 2 nanogram/kg per minute. If the patient develops headache or hypotension, the dose is decreased by 0.5 nanogram/kg per minute. The infusion is given for 6 hours/day for five days at the maximum tolerable rate, up to 2 nanogram/kg per minute.  'Prostacyclin therapy for severe injury presenting within 48 hours' above.)\n【133】 Prevention – Strategies for prevention of frostbite are discussed in the text.

Lymphocytosis does not require dosage modification (lymphocytosis is a pharmacologic effect of idelalisib and should not be considered progressive disease in the absence of other clinical findings).\n【70】 Dermatologic toxicity: Cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported (some fatal). Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms has also occurred. Other severe and/or life-threatening cutaneous reactions (grade 3 or higher), including exfoliative dermatitis, rash (generalized, erythematous, macular, maculopapular, papular, pruritic, exfoliative), and skin disorder, have been observed with idelalisib.\n【71】 GI events: Grade 3 or higher diarrhea or colitis have been reported in clinical trials (with idelalisib in combination with rituximab, and with off-label combination therapies). Diarrhea may occur at any time during therapy and responds poorly to antidiarrheal (antimotility) medications. The median time to resolution of diarrhea was 1 week to 1 month (following therapy interruption); corticosteroids were used in some cases to manage GI toxicity. Avoid concomitant use with other medications that may cause diarrhea. Serious and fatal intestinal perforation may occur. In some patients, perforation was preceded by moderate to severe diarrhea. Advise patients to promptly report any new or worsening abdominal pain, chills, fever, nausea, or vomiting.\n【72】 Hepatotoxicity: Fatal and/or serious hepatotoxicity has occurred. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with idelalisib in combination with rituximab, and with unapproved combination therapies. ALT/AST elevations >5 times ULN have occurred and were generally observed during the first 12 weeks of therapy; transaminase elevations were reversible upon therapy interruption. Hepatotoxicity may recur upon rechallenge, even with idelalisib resumed at a reduced dose.\n【73】 Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported.\n【74】 Infections: Fatal and/or serious infection has occurred. Infections have been reported with idelalisib in combination with rituximab, and with unapproved combination therapies.

Specifically, infections may occur with greater severity and/or atypical presentations.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【113】 Apixaban: CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Strong) may increase the serum concentration of Apixaban.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【114】 Aprepitant: CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Strong) may increase the serum concentration of Aprepitant.  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【115】 ARIPiprazole: CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Strong) may increase the serum concentration of ARIPiprazole.  Management: Aripiprazole dose reductions are required for indications other than major depressive disorder. Dose reductions vary based on formulation, initial starting dose, CYP2D6 genotype, and use of CYP2D6 inhibitors. See full interaction monograph for details. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【116】 ARIPiprazole Lauroxil: CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Strong) may increase serum concentrations of the active metabolite(s) of ARIPiprazole Lauroxil.  Management: Decrease aripiprazole lauroxil dose to next lower strength if used with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors for over 14 days. No dose adjustment needed if using the lowest dose (441 mg).

Patients who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy and for 1 month after the final idelalisib dose. Patients with partners who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy and for 3 months after the final idelalisib dose.\n【504】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【505】 Based on findings in animal reproduction studies and the mechanism of action, idelalisib may cause fetal harm if administered during pregnancy.\n【506】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【507】 It is not known if idelalisib is present in breast milk. Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, the manufacturer recommends not breastfeeding during treatment and for 1 month after the last idelalisib dose.\n【508】 Monitoring Parameters\n【509】 Complete blood counts with differential at least every 2 weeks for the first 6 months, and at least weekly in patients with neutropenia (ANC <1,000/mm3 ), or as clinically necessary; liver function tests at baseline and every 2 weeks for the first 3 months, every 4 weeks for the next 3 months, then every 1 to 3 months thereafter, or as clinically necessary; increase monitoring to weekly if ALT or AST >3 times ULN until resolved. Evaluate pregnancy status (prior to treatment initiation in patients who could become pregnant). Monitor for infections (including sepsis and pneumonia). Monitor for symptoms or laboratory evidence of opportunistic infections, including Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, cytomegalovirus, herpes virus infections, and Epstein-Barr virus (Hallek 2018). Monitor for signs/symptoms of diarrhea/colitis, intestinal perforation (new or worsening abdominal pain, chills, fever, nausea, or vomiting), pneumonitis (monitor for pulmonary symptoms and bilateral interstitial infiltrates), dermatologic toxicity, and hypersensitivity reactions. Monitor adherence.\n【510】 The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion (ASCO [Hwang 2020]) recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.\n【511】 Mechanism of Action\n【512】 Idelalisib is a potent small molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3Kδ), which is highly expressed in malignant lymphoid B-cells.

If untreated, TV atresia has a high mortality rate, with a survival rate as low as 10 percent at one year of age, depending on the type of TV atresia and the presence of other cardiac lesions .\n【2】 EPIDEMIOLOGY — TV atresia is the third most common cyanotic heart lesion, with an estimated prevalence of 0.5 to 1.2 per 10,000 live births . There is no difference in the incidence based on sex.\n【3】 ANATOMY — Although TV atresia is characterized by the absence of the TV, there is a spectrum of anatomic variants based on the morphology of the atresia and the presence of other cardiac structural lesions.\n【4】 Morphology of tricuspid valve atresia — Morphologic variation of TV atresia includes the following :\n【5】 Muscular atresia is the most common form, accounting for approximately 80 percent of patients. In this subtype, there is a solid muscular floor to the right atrium, with a dimple in the expected location of the TV.\n【6】 Membranous atresia (approximately 10 percent), in which the atrioventricular portion of the membranous septum forms the floor of the right atrium.\n【7】 Valvular atresia (5 percent), in which tiny valve cusps are fused together.\n【8】 Ebstein subtype, in which there is both downward displacement and fusion of the TV leaflets into the right ventricle (RV) wall .\n【9】 Rarely, patients with atrioventricular canal defects will have atresia of the right atrioventricular valve when a leaflet of a common atrioventricular valve seals off the entrance to the RV.\n【10】 Associated cardiac lesions — Associated cardiac lesions are universally seen in patients with TV atresia. This was illustrated in a study of 225 consecutive patients with TV atresia cared for at a single Canadian tertiary center between 1971 and 1999 . The following cardiac lesions and their relative frequency were observed:\n【11】 Atrial septal defect (100 percent) – In many cases, the atrial septal defect is a patent foramen ovale. The right atrium is typically enlarged and hypertrophied.\n【12】 Right ventricular hypoplasia (100 percent) – The RV is hypoplastic and often comprised of only the infundibular portion. The inflow portion of the RV can vary in size depending on the size of the ventricular septal defect (VSD).\n【13】 VSD (95 percent) – In TV atresia, muscular VSD is the most commonly observed type of VSD . Malalignment VSDs occur with a lower frequency but may contribute to subarterial obstruction. VSDs can be large, small, or absent . Spontaneous closure of the VSD has been reported and approximates the incidence of spontaneous closure of isolated VSDs .   \"Isolated ventricular septal defects (VSDs) in infants and children: Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\", section on 'Natural history'.)\n【14】 Pulmonary outflow obstruction (75 percent) – Pulmonary blood flow can be restricted by the presence of a small VSD, pulmonary valve stenosis or hypoplasia, or severe hypoplasia of the right ventricular outflow tract (eg, pulmonary artery defects).\n【15】 Ventricular arterial discordance including transposition of the great arteries or double-outlet right ventricle (28 percent).\n【16】 Severe pulmonary artery hypoplasia or distortion (17 percent).\n【17】 Aortic or subaortic stenosis (11 percent).\n【18】 Aortic coarctation or interruption (8 percent) – Coarctation is frequently associated with transposition of the great arteries .\n【19】 Coronary anomaly (3 percent).\n【20】 CLASSIFICATION — Several classification systems have been developed based on descriptions of the anatomic variants (eg, associated cardiac lesions and the morphology of atresia, described above) . The most widely used schema divides TV atresia into three categories based on the anatomy of the great arteries (aorta and pulmonary artery) . Subdivision within the first two categories is based on pulmonary blood flow, and the presence and size of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) is also used to categorize subtypes. Surgical management is generally based on the anatomy of the great arteries\n【21】 Type I (70 to 80 percent): Normal anatomy of the great arteries\n【22】 Type II (12 to 25 percent): D-transposition of the great arteries   \"D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA): Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis\")\n【23】 Type III (3 to 6 percent): Malposition defects of the great arteries other than D-transposition of the great arteries (eg, truncus arteriosus, atrioventricular septal defects, and double-outlet right ventricle)\n【24】 PATHOGENESIS — The pathogenesis of TV atresia is unknown. It is thought that most cases of TV atresia (muscular, membranous, and valvular subtypes) are derived from a similar disruption of normal development of the atrioventricular valves from the endocardial cushions and delamination of the ventricular myocardium.  'Morphology of tricuspid valve atresia' above.)\n【25】 Genetics — In some cases, an underlying genetic defect may contribute to the disruption of the normal development of the TV. Although no specific gene defect has been identified, supporting evidence for a genetic contribution includes the following:\n【26】 Studies in mice with TV atresia have identified mutations in the FOG2 gene (also referred to as ZFPM2) . The multi-zinc protein product of the FOG2 gene has a role in early cardiac development.\n【27】 Familial occurrence of TV atresia has been reported in three siblings, suggesting an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance .\n【28】 Association with chromosomal and syndromic conditions including trisomy 18 and 21, chromosomal 8 deletion, and VACTERL association (vertebral anomaly, anal atresia, cardiac defect, tracheoesophageal fistula, and renal and limb abnormalities) .\n【29】 PATHOPHYSIOLOGY — In TV atresia, the only exit of blood from the right atrium is through an interatrial communication. This obligate right-to-left atrial shunting is necessary for survival as it allows deoxygenated systemic venous blood to enter the left atrium and subsequently, the left ventricle (LV). As a result of the mixing of systemic and pulmonary venous blood in the left atrium, some level of cyanosis is always present .\n【30】 Type I TV atresia with normal anatomy of the great arteries:\n【31】 In patients with type II TV atresia with transposed great arteries, pulmonary blood flow is derived directly from the LV and systemic blood flow from the RV. In these patients, a VSD is critical as the RV, which provides the systemic circulation through the aorta, is dependent on blood flowing from the LV through the VSD. The presence of a restrictive or closing VSD and/or RV infundibular narrowing results in obstruction of systemic blood flow. If the obstruction is critical (severe), this results in diminished systemic circulation, leading to hypotension and, possibly, cardiogenic shock. In these patients, a PDA is critical for survival.\n【32】 CLINICAL PRESENTATION\n【33】 Fetal presentation — Advances in ultrasound technology have enabled antenatal screening between 18 and 22 weeks gestation to accurately make the diagnosis of TV atresia (image 1) . TV atresia is compatible with fetal survival, but there are significant changes in fetal heart circulation. In the normal fetal heart, the right ventricle (RV) is the dominant ventricle, with distribution of approximately 65 percent of the combined cardiac output, whereas the left ventricle (LV) distributes 35 percent of the output, which has entered the left atrium through the foramen ovale\n【34】 Postnatal presentation — Approximately 50 percent of patients who present postnatally with TV atresia do so on the first day of life, while an additional 30 percent present by one month of age . The typical presenting symptoms are cyanosis and a heart murmur .\n【35】 Pulmonary atresia – In patients with tricuspid and pulmonary valve atresia (types Ia and IIa), pulmonary blood flow is derived exclusively from a PDA. As the PDA closes in response to increasing arterial oxygen levels, these infants develop hypoxemia and acidosis. Closure of the PDA can be prevented with the initiation of prostaglandin therapy.  'Initial medical management' below.)\n【36】 Ventricular septal defect (VSD) and normally related great arteries – In patients with normal anatomy of the great arteries and VSD (types Ib and Ic), the following spectrum of clinical manifestations are observed:\n【37】 Transposition of the great vessels – In patients with D-transposition of the great arteries (type II), the aorta arises from the hypoplastic RV. Since there is mixing of systemic and pulmonary circulations through an atrial level communication, postnatal circulation is similar to fetal circulation. As a result, patients present with cyanosis or decreased oxygen saturation. These patients may develop symptoms of pulmonary overcirculation (eg, tachypnea, increased work of breathing). However, in patients with aortic arch hypoplasia, coarctation may develop as the PDA closes because of constriction of ductal tissue in the affected region of the aorta. As a result, maintenance of ductal patency may be required to preserve flow into the aorta.\n【38】 Physical examination — Central cyanosis is generally the most notable feature on physical examination. In addition, other findings include the following:\n【39】 On auscultation, a single second heart sound (S2) is heard. A holosystolic murmur may be heard at the left, lower sternal border when a VSD is present (movie 1). A continuous murmur may be evident in the setting of pulmonary atresia with a PDA (movie 2).   \"Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur\", section on 'Auscultation of heart sounds and murmurs'.)\n【40】 In patients with a restrictive atrial level communication, jugular venous distension with a prominent \"a\" wave and hepatomegaly may be detected.\n【41】 In patients with unrestrictive pulmonary blood flow, tachypnea may be present. In those with significant pulmonary blood flow, a diastolic rumble may be appreciated at the apex due to excessive mitral valve flow. This finding often signifies imbalance in circulation with a disproportionately large amount of pulmonary blood flow.\n【42】 Femoral pulses may be diminished with coarctation of the aorta.\n【43】 Initial tests — Most patients will undergo initial testing that includes pulse oximetry screening, chest radiography, and electrocardiography. However, the diagnosis is generally made by echocardiography.\n【44】 Pulse oximetry — Pulse oximetry, or arterial blood gas sampling, reveals oxygen desaturation consistent with the physical findings of cyanosis. The systemic oxygen saturation depends on the amount of left-to-right shunt through a PDA or, in some cases, VSD.   \"Newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease using pulse oximetry\".)\n【45】 Chest radiography — In the frontal projection of the chest radiograph, the smooth convexity of the right heart border is not  . There is variability in the heart size and prominence of pulmonary vascular findings depending on pulmonary blood flow:\n【46】 In patients with normal or decreased pulmonary blood flow (no VSD or small restricted VSD), there is a paucity of pulmonary markings and the heart size is usually normal\n【47】 In patients with increased pulmonary blood flow (eg, large VSD), there is often cardiomegaly and prominence of pulmonary vascularity\n【48】 Electrocardiogram — Surface electrocardiography demonstrates tall P waves, left axis deviation with a superior axis (>30°), LV hypertrophy, and diminished RV forces (waveform 1). In a cyanotic infant, the above findings can be pathognomonic for TV atresia . In patients with excessive pulmonary blood flow, a normal axis or right-axis deviation can be seen .\n【49】 Natural course — The natural course of this disease in the absence of surgical intervention is poor, with a reported mortality of approximately 75 percent and the majority of deaths occurring in early childhood .\n【50】 DIAGNOSIS\n【51】 Fetal diagnosis — Fetal echocardiography, in the typical four-chamber view, can accurately make a diagnosis of TV atresia between 18 and 22 weeks gestation by detecting the presence of a hypoplastic right ventricle (RV) and no patent TV (image 1) . Additional evaluation by fetal echocardiography should include assessment of the ventricular septum, relationship of the great arteries, status of pulmonary outflow, direction of flow in the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), patency of the atrial level communication, and assessment for presence of fetal hydrops. As noted above, the presence of reverse flow (left-to-right flow) in the ductus arteriosus suggests inadequate pulmonary outflow, which in turn indicates the need for postnatal initiation of prostaglandin infusion to maintain a PDA for adequate pulmonary blood flow and for survival.  'Initial medical management' below.)\n【52】 Postnatal diagnosis\n【53】 Echocardiography — The postnatal definitive diagnosis of TV atresia is generally made by echocardiography, which includes both anatomic and hemodynamic evaluation. The characteristic anatomic features of an absent TV, atrial septal defect, and RV hypoplasia are readily demonstrated by two-dimensional echocardiography (image 3).\n【54】 Other imaging tests — Other imaging modalities are rarely used to make the diagnosis of TV atresia:\n【55】 Cardiac catheterization has largely been replaced by echocardiography to make the diagnosis of TV atresia. It may be useful in delineating the anatomy in more complex lesions (eg, type III . In addition, hemodynamic and angiographic assessment with cardiac catheterization provides useful information prior to palliative interventions.\n【56】 Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan can be helpful for evaluation in adults.\n【57】 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — The differential diagnosis of most cases of TV atresia includes other cyanotic cardiac conditions that present with decreased pulmonary blood flow.   \"Cardiac causes of cyanosis in the newborn\", section on 'Decreased pulmonary blood flow'.)\n【58】 Tetralogy of Fallot\n【59】 Tricuspid stenosis\n【60】 Pulmonary valve atresia\n【61】 Critical valvar pulmonary stenosis\n【62】 MANAGEMENT\n【63】 Overview — Neonates with TV atresia should be cared for at a tertiary medical center with experience in managing complex congenital heart disease. When an antenatal diagnosis is made, maternal transfer should be performed so that neonatal care can be given immediately after birth.\n【64】 Initial medical management that ensures maintenance of adequate pulmonary blood flow and cardiovascular stability.\n【65】 Staged univentricular palliation. Cardiac transplantation, while an option, is not the preferred surgical approach owing, in part, to the scarcity of organs as well as the improved success with surgical palliation.\n【66】 If confounding factors preclude multiple surgical procedures (eg, multiple congenital anomalies or significant cerebrovascular accident), the family and care providers may choose compassionate care as a management approach for the infant.\n【67】 Initial medical management — Initial management is focused on stabilization of cardiac and pulmonary function and ensuring adequate pulmonary blood flow through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The goal of initial treatment is to stabilize and optimize the neonate's condition so that palliative repair can be performed.\n【68】 Administration of prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil) to maintain adequate ductal dependent pulmonary blood flow.   \"Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn\", section on 'Prostaglandin E1'.)\n【69】 General cardiorespiratory support for infants with respiratory compromise, hypotension, poor perfusion, acidosis, and hypothermia. These measures include respiratory support (eg, supplemental oxygen and/or mechanical ventilation), inotropic agents, and correction of acidosis and metabolic derangements (eg, hypoglycemia).   \"Diagnosis and initial management of cyanotic heart disease in the newborn\", section on 'General supportive care'.)\n【70】 Surgical management — The goal of staged single-ventricular palliation is to ensure adequate pulmonary and systemic blood flow with eventual separation of the two circulatory systems. As is true for most univentricular conditions (eg, hypoplastic left heart syndrome), the surgical management of TV atresia consists of three staged palliative procedures.   \"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Management and outcome\", section on 'Surgical management'.)\n【71】 First stage is performed in neonates\n【72】 Second stage (bidirectional Glenn procedure) is usually performed at three to six months of age\n【73】 Third stage (eg, Fontan procedure) is usually performed at two to five years of age\n【74】 First stage — The first stage of surgery is performed in the neonatal period. The goals of the initial palliation are to ensure that blood exiting the right atrium is unimpeded, provides adequate pulmonary blood flow, protects the pulmonary artery bed from high pressures that could result in higher risk for subsequent operations, and ensures unobstructed flow from the left ventricle (LV) to the aorta. The choice of initial palliative intervention depends on the anatomic variant . Outcomes in the various subtypes are generally comparable . The general approach is as follows:\n【75】 Type I TV atresia (with normally related great arteries):\n【76】 Type II TV atresia (with transposition of great arteries):\n【77】 Interstage management — After the initial stage of palliation, the infant should be followed with close cardiac monitoring for signs of progressive cyanosis or congestive heart failure if necessary. Prior to stage II and stage III, a comprehensive evaluation including echocardiography and cardiac catheterization is undertaken to evaluate for hemodynamic and anatomic suitability. Interventions to address any residual anatomic lesions such as branch pulmonary artery stenosis, aortic coarctation, and coiling aortopulmonary collaterals can be undertaken during these catheterizations. Interstage management is discussed in greater detail separately.   \"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Management and outcome\", section on 'Post-stage I management'.)\n【78】 Second stage — The second palliative procedure for both type I and type II lesions is a cavopulmonary anastomosis (bidirectional Glenn procedure). This stage of palliation is typically performed at three to six months of life when infants experience progressive cyanosis as they begin to outgrow their neonatal shunt. This surgery involves removal of the original shunt and direct anastomosis of the superior vena cava to the right pulmonary artery. The Glenn procedure relies on passive venous drainage from the superior vena cava directly into the pulmonary artery. However, there is persistent systemic desaturation due to continued inferior vena cava flow into the right atrium. Surgical mortality following a traditional bidirectional Glenn procedure is low (between 1 and 2 percent). Outcomes following the bidirectional Glenn procedure in patients with single-ventricle physiology are discussed in greater detail separately.   \"Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: Management and outcome\", section on 'Stage II: Cavopulmonary shunt'.)\n【79】 Third stage — The third stage (the Fontan procedure) creates a venous pathway (total cavopulmonary connection) that directs the inferior vena caval flow into the pulmonary arteries, resulting in the entire systemic venous return flowing passively into the pulmonary arteries . This creates a system with a single ventricle pumping blood into separate, in-series systemic and pulmonary circulations, thereby relieving cyanosis.\n【80】 OUTCOME\n【81】 Survival — Better patient selection, improved surgical techniques, and advances in perioperative care have contributed to lowering perioperative mortality in patients undergoing staged palliative repair. Interstage mortality continues to be an important contributor to reduced life expectancy in these patients . In the contemporary era, approximately 90 percent of patients with TV atresia survive to the age of one year; 10-year survival is approximately 80 percent .

There is a spectrum of anatomic variants based on the morphology of the atresia and the presence of other cardiac structural lesions (eg, ventricular septal defect [VSD] and abnormal anatomy of the great arteries).  'Anatomy' above.)\n【92】 Anatomic classification for TV atresia is based upon :\n【93】 In all forms of TV atresia, the only exit of blood from the right atrium is through an interatrial communication.

Severe compression results in direct tissue trauma and sequelae of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Once the compressive forces are released, muscle injury and swelling can occur, with possible muscle necrosis and neurologic dysfunction in the affected areas. Systemic manifestations resulting from crush injury, which is defined as crush syndrome, can result in organ dysfunction or death. It is imperative that rescuers and health care professionals recognize crush injury to avoid missing a narrow window of time in which to provide intensive fluid resuscitation, which may limit acute kidney injury.\n【2】 Severe crush injury in adults is reviewed. Prevention of crush syndrome and other causes of rhabdomyolysis are reviewed separately.   \"Pathophysiology, classification, and causes of acute extremity compartment syndrome\" and  \"Crush-related acute kidney injury\" and  \"Rhabdomyolysis: Epidemiology and etiology\".)\n【3】 DEFINITIONS AND MECHANISM OF INJURY\n【4】 Crush injury — Crush injury is the result of physical trauma from prolonged compression of the torso, limb(s), or other parts of the body. The resultant injury to the soft tissues, muscles, and nerves can be due to the primary direct effect of the trauma or ischemia related to compression. In addition to possible direct muscle or organ injury, after release of the compressive force, severe crush injury results in swelling in the affected areas, with possible muscle necrosis and neurologic dysfunction. This soft tissue injury can also be due to a secondary injury from subsequent compartment syndrome.\n【5】 Nontraumatic presentations of crush injury include patients with prolonged immobilization while intoxicated or under anesthesia. In such cases, the weight of the body part alone without relief may produce a compartment syndrome and rhabdomyolysis. Other causes of impaired consciousness such as stroke or coma can also result in prolonged immobilization with crush injury. The affected muscle compartment may be the one lying on a hard surface or may be caused by one extremity crossing over another, increasing local pressure. Gluteal compartment syndrome has been described in postoperative, intoxicated, and comatose patients with prolonged immobilization and may lead to crush syndrome, especially as presentation or recognition is frequently delayed . Other causes of nontraumatic crush syndrome have been described, including ischemic, metabolic, toxicologic, and oncologic causes of rhabdomyolysis.\n【6】 Crush syndrome — Crush syndrome is defined as the systemic manifestations resulting from crush injury, which can result in organ dysfunction (predominantly acute kidney injury [AKI], but multisystem organ injury can also occur), or death . The manifestations of crush syndrome are the systemic consequences of muscle injury, specifically rhabdomyolysis, which commonly result in AKI.\n【7】 Crush syndrome can also manifest in other situations where there is compression of the tissues. As examples, crush syndrome can occur with prolonged immobilization, burns, and electrical injury. Crush syndrome is the second leading cause of death in earthquakes, following direct trauma.\n【8】 Mechanism of injury — Typical causes of crush injury include being trapped under a vehicle or related to industrial, construction, or agricultural accidents . In natural disasters such as major earthquakes, 3 to 20 percent of mass casualties may involve crush injuries due to building collapse and entrapment . Mass crowd stampedes can cause crush injuries as well as traumatic asphyxia .  'Traumatic asphyxia' below.)\n【9】 The compressive force causes direct tissue damage while occluding venous outflow. With prolonged compression, the resultant cellular death, in particular myonecrosis, may lead to crush syndrome. Clinical deterioration including death can occur within 20 minutes of extrication, leading to the nickname of \"smiling death\". The victim, smiling after extrication and rescue, suddenly arrests from ventricular fibrillation from the efflux of potassium, phosphorus, and myoglobin from the areas of injury. Delayed complications and death that occur as a result of renal failure were well documented in patients extricated from collapsed buildings during historic earthquakes and during the 1941 London Blitz bombings .\n【10】 Primary prevention of crush injury might be possible only via industrial safety regulations, building codes, and injury prevention programs. Once a crush injury has occurred, secondary prevention of crush syndrome may be possible with timely management at the scene of injury and carried on through field care, prehospital transport, and initial hospital care.  'Extrication and on scene management' below.)\n【11】 EXTRICATION AND ON SCENE MANAGEMENT — Patients with crush injuries are often trapped at the scene. Individual victims or small numbers of individuals experiencing injury may be extricated by bystanders or professional rescuers and receive prehospital care via emergency medical services (EMS).\n【12】 However, large-scale mass trauma events such as earthquakes and major building collapses in natural or manmade disasters may entrap dozens to thousands of victims. This may require the deployment of Urban Search and Rescue teams (USAR), which in the United States are in partnership with local fire departments, law enforcement agencies, federal and local governmental agencies, and private companies.\n【13】 Extrication time is strongly associated with earthquake-related mortality. Children and older individuals are highly vulnerable. Entrapment >24 hours is highly associated with mortality. A limited number of survivors may be extricated from 48 hours to 14 days later . Survivors are frequently found in voids in the collapsed structure. Most deaths occur in victims trapped beneath rubble who received forces too great to withstand; other causes of death include dust inhalation, traumatic asphyxia, head injury, or multiple injuries. In addition, in many events, rescuers may comprise a significant percentage or even a majority of casualties. Extrication of victims from collapsed structures is hazardous, and the risk of secondary collapse is significant.\n【14】 Confined space medicine — Since extrication of victims may require tunneling and supporting debris, and victims may be physically entrapped, \"scoop and run\" is often not possible, requiring initial crush injury care and crush syndrome prevention to be provided by rescuers inside the structure termed \"confined space medicine\" (CSM) . Delivery of medical care in such environments is hazardous and requires special training with attention to managing hazards such as dust, temperature extremes, hazardous materials and gases, fire, explosions, secondary collapse, and providing care while wearing personal protective equipment. The safety of the rescuers is paramount, and safety is the responsibility of the scene incident commander and the incident command system .\n【15】 While most mass crush injury events are associated with earthquakes, terrorist bombings are increasingly a cause of structural collapse. In these circumstances, crush injuries may be associated with blast injury, fire, or toxic inhalation. Local endemic diseases may also represent a threat to victims and rescuers.\n【16】 Support of airway, breathing, circulation — Crush injury to the chest is a significant source of respiratory failure and death. Patients may require oxygen, airway adjuncts such as oral and nasal airways, intubation (at times a surgical airway), and the use of portable ventilators. Inhalation injury due to dust or associated with hot gases, such as in fire or bombings, can also require advanced airway management. Provision of CSM trauma care may require airway management in unusual positions and orientations.   \"Inhalation injury from heat, smoke, or chemical irritants\".)\n【17】 Pneumothorax, hemothorax, flail chest, and pulmonary contusion may require chest decompression (eg, needle or finger decompression, chest tube) during extrication care.   \"Initial evaluation and management of chest wall trauma in adults\" and  \"Thoracostomy tubes and catheters: Indications and tube selection in adults and children\".)\n【18】 Hypovolemia may be due to a number of reasons. For patients with prolonged entrapment, dehydration is a common cause of hypovolemia and is a leading cause of death. Hemorrhage, third spacing, and burns may also cause hypovolemia. Hemorrhage from traumatic injuries may be delayed due to compression of wounds or organ injuries until after extrication. Immediate management of hypovolemia and prevention of crush syndrome and death from post-release hyperkalemia requires rapid access with large-bore intravenous catheters and administration of isotonic saline. Potassium-containing solutions should be avoided. Crush injury without adequate fluid resuscitation develops into crush syndrome. Urine output is monitored during prolonged field care.   \"Crush-related acute kidney injury\".)\n【19】 USAR teams, CSM paramedics, and EMS paramedics use fluid administration algorithms to prevent crush-related acute kidney injury . Typically, a 1000 mL/hour bolus of normal saline is initially administered to adults for two hours, then reduced to 500 mL/hour (algorithm 1) . Smaller volumes such as 10 cc/kg are recommended for those with known heart failure, renal failure, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n【20】 Extremity reperfusion and hyperkalemia — Upon release of a trapped extremity, patients can have minimal symptoms and the extremity may be only mildly erythematous or ecchymotic, or it can be obviously mottled and ischemic.\n【21】 Any pain can be managed with opioids or ketamine according to local EMS protocols .\n【22】 The release of potassium from injured and necrotic muscles and other tissues can lead to a rapid onset of hyperkalemia and ventricular fibrillation. Prehospital administration of intravenous crystalloid is the mainstay of treatment (algorithm 1) and is associated with improved outcomes.   \"Crush-related acute kidney injury\", section on 'Prevention of hyperkalemia' and  \"Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults\".)\n【23】 A prehospital electrocardiogram tracing can detect the peaked T-waves and widened QRS of hyperkalemia and can be treated by the paramedic with calcium chloride, inhaled albuterol, and intravenous insulin, depending on local medical direction.\n【24】 Placement of tourniquets to isolate a crushed limb with intent of preventing the release of potassium and other cellular contents into the circulation from an extremity has not been supported by evidence and is not recommended . Tourniquets should only be used to control extremity bleeding. Similarly, prophylactic fasciotomy should not be performed in the field due to the infection risks .  'Extremity crush injury' below.)\n【25】 Furthermore, prehospital amputation of severely crushed or mangled limbs solely to avoid crush syndrome is also not supported by evidence and increases the risk of stump infection. However, amputation may be needed as a last resort to extricate a victim.  'Field amputation' below.)\n【26】 Field amputation — Some patients who are trapped have extremities that cannot be extricated from debris or structure in a timely fashion (eg, structural failure imminent). In such cases, amputation in the field may be required as a last resort for extrication. Manual or powered saws have been used depending on available space, resources, and risk of explosive gases.   \"Techniques for lower extremity amputation\".)\n【27】 In some jurisdictions, the protocol may include an incident-command trained surgical emergency team from a trauma center to provide surgical expertise beyond the paramedic's scope of practice. Whenever possible, a surgical team, if available, should be dispatched to perform this procedure. Typically, a tourniquet is applied and a guillotine amputation as distally as possible is performed, although a through-knee amputation may be appropriate if the lower leg is nonviable. Anesthesia and analgesia should also be provided as tolerated. Suggestions for appropriate drugs and equipment safe for use in confined and hazardous environments are available .\n【28】 Triage and transport — Triage at the scene, rapid transport of \"immediate\" triage category patients via cleared routes, and retriage at the hospital are essential for optimal survival (algorithm 2).\n【29】 Scene triage usually uses three categories to determine priority to receive treatment at the scene and transport: \"immediate\" patients are treated and transported first, followed by the \"delayed\" category. \"Minor\" category patients may be treated and released at the scene or transported last. An \"expectant\" category is often used for patients with a low likelihood of survival, such as postcardiac arrest patients, severe head injuries, patients in persistent shock, and patients with massive burns; these patients may receive palliative care\n【30】 The majority of patients, typically 80 to 85 percent in mass casualty events such as earthquakes, require only basic medical care without major procedures or organ support. Typically, in bombings with building collapse scenarios, approximately 50 percent of patients arrive at the facility in the first hour and have lower acuity and higher survival than the remaining half, who will arrive over the next eight hours or more . Lower acuity patients should be triaged quickly, treated rapidly, and discharged. Many facilities will use alternative external spaces to triage directly outside the facility to prevent patients with minor injuries from even entering the hospital . This avoids filling the hospital before more severely injured patients arrive. Only approximately 15 to 20 percent of earthquake casualties will require hospitalization, major procedures, or organ support. This latter group is at risk of death, and mortality in this group is termed the \"critical mortality rate.\"\n【31】 Secondary transport may be limited by the condition of the patient; some crush injury patients may have hemorrhage from wounds or internal injuries, hemorrhagic shock, hyperkalemia, and respiratory failure, which may reduce the distance the patient is able to travel or may require critical care transport logistics. In situations of overwhelmed and destroyed local resources, triage decisions may be needed to determine those likely to survive transport and subsequent care. Patients with a low likelihood of survival, such as post-cardiac arrest patients, severe head injuries, patients in shock, patients with massive burns, or patients with multiple organ failures, may not be good candidates for secondary transport.   \"Overview of the management of the severely burned patient\", section on 'Triage and transfer' and  \"Overview of the management of the severely burned patient\", section on 'Combined burn/trauma'.)\n【32】 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS — Crush injury refers to trauma caused by a direct crushing force. In addition to the direct tissue damage, the compressive force prevents venous outflow, leading to accumulation of potassium, phosphorus, and myoglobin in the tissues. Venous obstruction may be also associated with extremity edema.\n【33】 Traumatic asphyxia — Severe crush injury to the chest (eg, heavy object, stampede) can result in traumatic asphyxia. This is due to the significant increase in the thoracic pressure and pressure within the superior vena cava; this increased pressure in addition to attempts at inspiration against a closed glottis can lead to capillary rupture in the head and neck. The classic appearance is of cervicofacial cyanosis, edema, subconjunctival hemorrhage, and petechial eruptions on the face, neck, and torso above where the object was compressing the victim . This injury is typically , as more than a few minutes of asphyxia results in death. Traumatic asphyxia has been seen in crowd crush events, such as stampedes at sports, religious, music, and political events. Victims may also have been trampled and have musculoskeletal injuries and fractures. Traumatic asphyxia may be combined with liver and spleen lacerations, rib fractures, pulmonary contusions, and anoxic brain injury .\n【34】 Hypovolemia — Crush injury patients commonly have hypovolemic shock in the first few hours of presentation. This may be from an obvious source due to external hemorrhage from an injured extremity or occult, related to organ injury. Another possible cause of hypovolemic shock in crush injury patients is a distributive shock associated with third spacing and the inflammatory response to the reperfusion injury and cell death .\n【35】 It is critical to recognize and treat the cause of shock to prevent further tissue ischemia and cell death. Hypotension may also worsen the risk of developing subsequent acute kidney injury (AKI).  'Sequelae of crush injury' below.)\n【36】 Extremity crush injury — Crush injury to the extremity can present clinically within a spectrum from generalized swelling and erythema to blisters and purpura to open fractures and mangled extremities with ischemia. In addition to management of the expected orthopedic and vascular issues associated with this type of injury, awareness is needed for the potential of these patients to develop acute compartment syndrome and rhabdomyolysis. These can occur either due to the crushing direct trauma causing tissue swelling or due to the prolonged hypoperfused state causing an ischemia-reperfusion injury that can result in swelling, acute compartment syndrome, and rhabdomyolysis. Prolonged compression can lead to cell death, causing muscle necrosis and rhabdomyolysis . This can be associated with compartment syndrome and systemic manifestations of tissue damage leading to crush syndrome. Prolonged compression of major arteries can also lead to intimal injury and thrombosis, which further exacerbates distal ischemia.   \"Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities\" and  \"Rhabdomyolysis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\" and  \"Crush-related acute kidney injury\".)\n【37】 Organ injury — Blunt injury to the thorax or abdomen can also result in pulmonary contusion, cardiac contusion, rib fractures, pelvic fracture, hemothorax, pneumothorax, and other blunt solid and hollow viscus injuries. Prolonged compression has even been associated with spinal cord injury without fracture . Blunt injury from the crush mechanisms can be complicated by concomitant penetrating injury as a result of projectiles.\n【38】 Sequelae of crush injury\n【39】 Acute kidney injury — (AKI) — The development of AKI can be multifactorial. While crush syndrome can cause AKI due to the directly nephrotoxic effects of heme products and the tubular obstruction by myoglobin and urate crystals, hypotension and hypoperfusion can also contribute to acute tubular necrosis . Crush-related AKI manifests as rhabdomyolysis and myoglobulinemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and myoglobinuria.   \"Crush-related acute kidney injury\".)\n【40】 The prognosis for those with AKI who survive and do not become chronically dialysis-dependent is good. Older individuals and those with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk for progression to end-stage kidney disease. Even with optimal circumstances, the risk of dialysis is approximately 10 percent .\n【41】 Acute respiratory distress syndrome — Acute respiratory distress syndrome can also occur following severe crush injury. Contributing factors can be large-volume crystalloid resuscitation, the inflammatory response to injury, tissue necrosis, distributive shock, or fat embolism syndrome associated with long-bone fractures.   \"Crush-related acute kidney injury\" and  \"Fat embolism syndrome\" and  \"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Clinical features, diagnosis, and complications in adults\" and  \"Acute respiratory distress syndrome: Fluid management, pharmacotherapy, and supportive care in adults\".)\n【42】 HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE CRUSH INJURY\n【43】 Initial trauma management — The initial management of trauma patients at the emergency department is described in the Advanced Trauma Life Support program.   \"Initial management of trauma in adults\".)\n【44】 Administration of isotonic saline initiated in the field should be continued with close monitoring of urine output (algorithm 1).\n【45】 Ongoing trauma management — The management of patients with crush injury includes all the components of care used for other trauma patients.   \"Overview of inpatient management of the adult trauma patient\".)\n【46】 Clinical monitoring — Clinical examination and laboratory studies should be performed several times each day until stabilized. These include electrolytes (particularly serum sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate), creatinine, and arterial blood gases with lactate and/or base deficit. A urinary bladder catheter should be placed upon admission for close monitoring of urine output.\n【47】 For patients with an overt history or history suggestive of crush injury, the patient should be monitored continuously, and electrolytes (particularly potassium, calcium, and phosphate) and arterial blood gas should be obtained. Urine myoglobin and creatine kinase can be obtained to detect rhabdomyolysis.   \"Rhabdomyolysis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\" and  \"Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury\" and  \"Prevention and treatment of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury (including rhabdomyolysis)\".)\n【48】 Mangled extremities — Some extremity crush injuries are so severe, the injured limb will be of questionable viability. The need for amputations varies widely (3 to 59 percent) depending on delays in extrication, associated injuries, and local resources. Guidelines suggest that amputation should be restricted to cases where a limb is nonsalvageable or when injuries to the limb are causing sepsis, systemic inflammation, or uncontrollable hemorrhage . Decision-making regarding limb salvage is clinical; scoring systems such as the mangled extremity severity score (MESS) have not been shown to be predictive and have worse performance compared with the judgment of experienced surgeons. In a mass casualty situation, the resources such as blood transfusion needed to attempt limb salvage may be inadequate, and amputation may be more likely to be necessary.   \"Severe upper extremity injury in the adult patient\" and  \"Severe lower extremity injury in the adult patient\" and  \"Surgical management of severe upper extremity injury\" and  \"Surgical management of severe lower extremity injury\".)\n【49】 Severe crush injury is a known cause of acute extremity compartment syndrome. Early recognition, evaluation, and treatment of compartment syndrome reduces the risk of crush syndrome and limb loss. Fasciotomy to fully decompress all involved compartments is the definitive treatment for established extremity compartment syndrome in the great majority of cases . Delays in performing fasciotomy increase morbidity, including the need for amputation. The clinical features of acute extremity compartment syndrome and fasciotomy, including the difference between upper and lower extremities, are reviewed separately.   \"Pathophysiology, classification, and causes of acute extremity compartment syndrome\", section on 'Classification' and  \"Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities\" and  \"Upper extremity fasciotomy techniques\" and  \"Lower extremity fasciotomy techniques\".)\n【50】 Controversy exists over the role of prophylactic fasciotomy in severe crush injury. In the authors' experience in a level 1 trauma center, we do not perform prophylactic fasciotomy for severe crush injury. We typically perform fasciotomies only if established acute compartment syndrome is present clinically on admission or if measured compartment pressures demonstrate a difference between the diastolic blood pressure and the compartment pressure (delta pressure) of 30 mmHg or less. Impending compartment syndrome in indeterminate cases might be suspected by rising measured compartment pressures and is managed by serial examinations, and may lead to fasciotomies as the delta pressure falls to 30 mmHg or less. Prophylactic fasciotomy in the absence of measured compartment pressure elevation is also not recommended in mass crush injury events. In several earthquake studies, routine use of fasciotomy in crushed limbs has not led to improvement in outcomes, but rather to higher rates of bleeding, infection, and amputation . In resource-limited environments, good outcomes from fasciotomy seem less assured, and a more limited role for fasciotomy may be appropriate to avoid unnecessary fasciotomies and excess infections. Such fasciotomies consume scarce operating room time and increase wound-care workload when resources are limited. In such scenarios, some authors recommend that fasciotomy in severely crushed limbs be performed only in established acute compartment syndromes, when distal pulses are significantly diminished or lost .\n【51】 Fasciotomy for late compartment syndrome, after eight hours, is also controversial. Extensive myonecrosis is very likely to be present, and performing fasciotomy without amputation obliges the clinician to perform serial surgical debridements and to monitor the wound and patient carefully for wound sepsis and systemic problems, such as rhabdomyolysis and renal failure. The authors recommend avoidance of late fasciotomy in resource-limited events.\n【52】 Organ injury — Torso crush injuries are associated with solid injuries, including hepatic and splenic lacerations, as well as hollow viscus injuries. The likelihood of these injuries may be increased in structural collapses caused by bombings. Mortality rates are higher for those with associated thoracic or abdominal injuries. Specific management of traumatic injuries is reviewed separately.\n【53】 Renal replacement therapy and mass casualty events — Once acute kidney injury is established, aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is no longer appropriate. Hemodialysis is initiated for the usual indications of volume overload, hyperkalemia, severe acidemia, and uremia. Crush injury can be associated with very rapid and severe onset of hyperkalemia, and hemodialysis may be required two or more times a day to control.   \"Crush-related acute kidney injury\", section on 'Treatment of established acute kidney injury'.)\n【54】 Earthquakes and other mass casualty events leading to large numbers of crush syndrome patients may place severe demands on local health care systems. Mass crush injuries may produce excess demand on dialysis facilities and critical care units, with a need for more dialysis machines and operators as well as ventilators and critical care unit health providers. The need for acute hemodialysis may overwhelm local resources and threaten access for chronic hemodialysis patients. This may require the activation of surge plans, equipment caches, or secondary transport of casualties to areas with still intact infrastructure able to manage these casualties. Critically ill, multiply injured patients in the intensive care unit may require continuous renal replacement therapies, which place additional demands on dialysis resources and personnel. While there are limited data on the optimal technique of continuous renal replacement in rhabdomyolysis, a small trial reported that myoglobin clearance was improved using continuous venovenous hemodialysis with high cutoff dialyzer and regional citrate anticoagulation compared with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration with regional citrate anticoagulation .\n【55】 Within the United States, the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS) may provide a Crush Injury Specialty Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT), which provides advice to local facilities. Evacuation of dialysis patients to other areas of the United States coordinated by the NDMS is another strategy.\n【56】 Worldwide, in 1989 the International Society of Nephrology created the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force, which offers personnel, material, advice, and psychological support to support providers and paramedics for any disaster that involves renal disease .\n【57】 When inadequate numbers of hemodialysis machines are available, peritoneal dialysis can be used, despite its slower clearance of potassium . Any mass casualty event can make a severe demand on ventilators and respiratory care providers. All states should have a ventilator allocation plan based on the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention influenza planning.\n【58】 Psychosocial support — Psychologic trauma is a component of crush injury. Family and other caregivers, health care workers, and uninjured victims may also experience shock and grief and later depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Suicide is a risk for disaster survivors, first responders, and health care providers . Disaster response planning should include plans to provide emotional, psychologic, psychiatric, and social support to all who need it .   \"Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Treatment overview\".)\n【59】 MORTALITY — The majority of mortality in mass crush injuries occurs at the scene due to traumatic asphyxia, severe traumatic brain injury, and severe hemorrhagic shock . \"Time under the rubble\" is an important determinant of survival. Historically, 80 percent of entrapped victims die quickly by the direct effects of trauma or traumatic asphyxia, 10 percent survive with minor trauma, while 10 percent are badly injured. Among those, 40 to 70 percent develop crush syndrome. Other complications of crush injury, including non-acute kidney injury-associated hyperkalemia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sepsis, can also lead to death.\n【60】 Mortality related to crush syndrome varies depending on patient and local factors; patients with rhabdomyolysis-induced renal failure have a mortality of approximately 20 percent, but this rate will be higher in patients with multiple injuries or multiorgan failure and when local resources are overwhelmed .\n【61】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": General issues of trauma management in adults\" and  \": Severe blunt or penetrating extremity trauma\" and  \": Thoracic trauma\" and  \": Health concerns following a disaster\" and  \": Extremity compartment syndrome\" and  \": Thoracic and lumbar spine injury in adults\" and  \": Traumatic abdominal and non-genitourinary retroperitoneal injury\".)\n", "title": "成人严重挤压伤", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/severe-crush-injury-in-adults?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E9%BC%BB%E5%88%9B%E4%BC%A4%E6%80%A7%E5%88%87%E6%96%AD&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:13:49"}

Clinical features of atopic dermatitis include skin dryness, scaling, erythema, oozing, crusting, and lichenification. Pruritus is a hallmark of the condition and is responsible for much of the disease burden for patients and their families and caregivers. The goals of treatment include reducing symptoms and signs, preventing exacerbations and minimizing therapeutic risks. Standard treatment modalities for the management of these patients are centered on the use of topical anti-inflammatory preparations and moisturization of the skin, but patients with severe disease may require phototherapy or systemic treatment .\n【2】 ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY — For the management of the individual patient, it is important that clinicians evaluate the extent and characteristics of the rash (eg, presence of erythema, excoriations, oozing, lichenification, clinical signs of bacterial superinfection) and ask general questions about itch, skin pain, sleep, impact on daily activities, frequency of flares, and persistence of disease . Importantly, erythema is difficult to assess in patients with darkly pigmented skin, and therefore, severity of atopic dermatitis can be underestimated in these patients. Marked lichenification indicates that itching or rubbing has been chronic and may reflect undertreatment.\n【3】 The physician-reported Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI; 0 to 72)\n【4】 The Investigator Global Assessment (IGA; 0 = clear, 1 = almost clear, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe)\n【5】 The joint-reported Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD; 0 to 103)\n【6】 The patient-reported Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM; 0 to 28)\n【7】 The Peak Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (0 to 10)\n【8】 Mild – Areas of dry skin, infrequent itching (with or without small areas of redness); little impact on everyday activities, sleep, and psychosocial well-being\n【9】 Moderate – Areas of dry skin, frequent itching, redness (with or without excoriation and localized skin thickening); moderate impact on everyday activities and psychosocial well-being, frequently disturbed sleep\n【10】 Severe – Widespread areas of dry skin, incessant itching, redness (with or without excoriation, extensive skin thickening, bleeding, oozing, cracking, and alteration of pigmentation); severe limitation of everyday activities and psychosocial functioning, nightly loss of sleep\n【11】 GENERAL APPROACH — The optimal management of atopic dermatitis requires a multipronged approach that involves patient education, hydration of the skin and restoration of the skin barrier function, pharmacologic treatment of skin inflammation, and elimination of exacerbating factors (algorithm 1) .\n【12】 Patient education — Patient education is an important component of the management of atopic dermatitis. A systematic review of nine randomized trials (>2000 participants) of educational interventions for atopic dermatitis suggests that children and their parents/caregivers may benefit from structured education provided by nurses or multidisciplinary teams . In the largest of these trials, which included 992 children and adolescents with atopic dermatitis and their families, a six-week education program was compared with no intervention . The program consisted of two-hour weekly sessions (covering medical, nutritional, and psychologic issues) led by a multidisciplinary team of dermatologists or pediatricians, psychologists, and dietitians. After one year, the decrease in the severity (based on the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis [SCORAD] score) was greater in the intervention groups than in the control groups for all ages groups (from 3 months to 18 years). There was also improvement in subjective assessment of severity, itching behavior, and emotional coping for patients aged 8 to 12 years (not assessed in younger children and not significant for ages 13 to 17 years).\n【13】 Maintaining skin hydration\n【14】 Bathing practices\n【15】 Frequency of bathing — Most experts recommend a hydrating bath using mild or soap-free cleansers followed by immediate emollient application to prevent skin drying, but others recommend a shower of short duration. We feel that either option is reasonable but suggest less frequent bathing in infants and up to daily bathing/showering in older children and adults. Only a few, small trials have addressed this controversy .\n【16】 A small, randomized, single-blind, crossover trial examining the effect of frequent (twice daily) versus infrequent (twice weekly) soak-and-seal baths in 42 children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis found that frequent bathing was associated with a greater decrease of SCORAD score from baseline compared with infrequent bathing (mean difference in SCORAD 21.2 [95% CI 4.9-27.6]) .\n【17】 Another study of 1303 infants showed higher transepidermal water loss and higher prevalence of atopic dermatitis at three months of age in those who bathed at least daily versus two to four times weekly; however, the risk of developing atopic dermatitis at 12 months was similar in the two groups .\n【18】 Bath additives — We agree with the American Academy of Dermatology’s recommendation against the use of bath additives for atopic dermatitis . Despite the lack of high-quality studies providing evidence of benefit, bath emollient additives (eg, liquid paraffin, oils with or without emulsifiers, colloidal oatmeal) are widely used to improve skin hydration and supported by national and international guidelines . The one exception may be the addition of sodium hypochlorite (bleach) to a 0.005% concentration to reduce the cutaneous load of S. aureus.  'Management of infection' below.)\n【19】 Emollients and moisturizers — Skin hydration is a key component of the overall management of patients with atopic dermatitis. To maintain skin hydration, emollients should be applied at least two times per day and preferably immediately after bathing or hand washing, when the skin is well hydrated.\n【20】 Based on both physician and patient assessment, the use of any moisturizers reduced eczema severity and itch compared with no use, resulted in fewer flares, and reduced the need for topical corticosteroids.\n【21】 In three studies, patients found that a moisturizer containing glycyrrhetinic acid (a natural anti-inflammatory agent) was four times more effective than vehicle in reducing eczema severity.\n【22】 In four studies, patients using a cream containing urea (a humectant agent) reported improvement more often than those using a control cream without urea.\n【23】 Three studies assessed a moisturizer containing glycerol (a humectant agent) versus control. More patients in the glycerol group experienced skin improvement, both by physician and patient assessment.\n【24】 Four studies examined oat-containing moisturizers versus no treatment or control. No significant difference in skin improvement was noted between groups, although patients using oat moisturizers tended to have fewer flares and reduced need for topical corticosteroids.\n【25】 Elimination of exacerbating factors\n【26】 General considerations — Exacerbating factors that disrupt an already abnormal epidermal barrier include :\n【27】 Excessive bathing without subsequent moisturization\n【28】 Low-humidity environments\n【29】 Emotional stress\n【30】 Xerosis (dry skin)\n【31】 Overheating and sweating\n【32】 Use of hard water\n【33】 Exposure to solvents and detergents\n【34】 Avoiding pruritogens and irritants, such as rough wool clothing, fragranced soaps, perfumes, detergents, household cleaning products, chemical substances\n【35】 Treating skin infections  'Management of infection' below)\n【36】 Managing stress and anxiety\n【37】 Aeroallergens and food allergens — Whether environmental or food allergens are exacerbating factors in patients with atopic dermatitis is controversial.   \"Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)\".)\n【38】 Environmental allergens – Hypersensitivity to house dust mites (eg, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Dermatophagoides farinae), animal danders, molds, and pollens is thought to be associated with flares of atopic dermatitis and disease severity . In one study, a linear relationship was observed between the degree of sensitization to dust mite and cat dander and severity of atopic dermatitis .\n【39】 However, despite the hypersensitivity of many individuals with atopic dermatitis to house dust mites, reduction of house dust mite antigens in the patient's environment has not been found useful for disease control .\n【40】 Food allergens – Exacerbation of atopic dermatitis by food allergens is uncommon. Although approximately 50 percent of children with atopic dermatitis have positive skin prick tests or specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) to one or more food allergens (in particular, cow's milk, egg, wheat, and peanut), food sensitization is clinically irrelevant for the course of atopic dermatitis in most cases . Thus, dietary interventions are not helpful in reducing the severity or preventing flares in unselected patients.\n【41】 A systematic review of nine randomized trials including 421 children and adults with atopic dermatitis indicated lack of benefit of either milk and egg exclusion, a few-foods diet, or an elemental diet in unselected patients with atopic dermatitis . Moreover, food restriction in toddlers may result in lower Z-scores of weight, height, head circumference, and body mass index for age . One trial suggests that an egg-free diet may be helpful for infants with proven sensitivity to eggs .\n【42】 Little is known on the role of food allergy in adults with atopic dermatitis, but adults with atopic dermatitis and birch allergy may experience worsening if they ingest birch pollen-related foods .\n【43】 Contact irritants and allergens — Patients with atopic dermatitis are more susceptible to both irritant and allergic contact dermatitis and would benefit from identification of triggers and avoidance. An example of irritant contact dermatitis in patients with atopic dermatitis is the lip licker's dermatitis of the perioral area due to contact with saliva  or dermatitis on the palmar and dorsal aspects of the hands due to frequent hand washing or use of hand sanitizers.\n【44】 PATIENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE DISEASE\n【45】 Topical corticosteroids — Topical corticosteroids and emollients are the mainstay of therapy for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (algorithm 1) . Regardless of disease severity, emollients should be liberally used multiple times per day as they soothe the skin and reduce the need for topical corticosteroids. Emollients can be applied before or after topical corticosteroids .  'Emollients and moisturizers' above.)\n【46】 Selection of topical corticosteroid potency and formulation – The choice of topical corticosteroid potency should be based on the patient's age, body area involved, and degree of skin inflammation. It should be noted that ointment formulations tend to be more potent and have superior emollient properties than their cream counterparts. Cream formulations contain more additives than ointments and are more likely to burn or sting. Oil formulations spread more easily and are useful for scalp or large body surface areas. However, the choice of formulation should also be based on patient’s preference.\n【47】 Administration – Published guidelines recommend twice-daily application for most topical corticosteroids during acute flares, but there is evidence suggesting that once-daily application may result in similar efficacy .\n【48】 Mild disease – For patients with mild atopic dermatitis, we suggest a low-potency (groups 5 and 6  once to twice daily until three to five days after clearance or up to two weeks. Following clearance, maintenance treatment with emollients alone is usually sufficient.\n【49】 Moderate disease – For patients with moderate to severe disease, we suggest medium- to high-potency (groups 2 to 4\n【50】 Face and skin folds – The face and skin folds are areas at higher risk for atrophy with corticosteroids. Initial therapy in these areas should start with a low-potency steroid (group 6  may produce a more rapid response, after which patients can be switched to lower-potency preparations.\n【51】 Topical calcineurin inhibitors, which do not cause skin atrophy or ocular toxicity, are an alternative to topical corticosteroids  'Topical calcineurin inhibitors' below). Other nonsteroidal topical treatments such as crisaborole and topical ruxolitinib are also safe for sensitive areas.  'Crisaborole' below and 'Topical ruxolitinib' below.)\n【52】 Ear canal – Fluocinolone 0.01% oil or topical corticosteroid-based ophthalmic solutions (eg, prednisolone 1% ophthalmic solution) can be used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis involving the ear canal. If using a cream or ointment, a cotton-tipped stick may facilitate the application.   \"External otitis: Treatment\", section on 'Glucocorticoids'.)\n【53】 Efficacy and adverse effects – A systematic review of randomized trials identified 83 studies of topical corticosteroids for atopic dermatitis . Although studies were of poor methodologic quality and short duration (<4 weeks), all indicated a greater efficacy of topical corticosteroids compared with placebo.\n【54】 Long-term use of topical corticosteroids, especially high- or super high-potency preparations, on large body areas may lead to systemic absorption with adrenal suppression and other systemic adverse events, such as osteoporosis and type 2 diabetes . Local adverse effects include skin thinning (including striae), telangiectasias, hypertrichosis, folliculitis, and contact dermatitis but are generally limited to chronic use of stronger topical corticosteroids. The use of topical corticosteroids on the eyelids, where the skin is thinnest, can lead to adverse ocular effects (eg, glaucoma or cataracts).   \"Topical corticosteroids: Use and adverse effects\", section on 'Adverse effects'.)\n【55】 Topical calcineurin inhibitors — The topical calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are nonsteroidal, immunomodulating agents that do not cause skin atrophy or other corticosteroid-induced adverse effects . They can be used as an alternative to topical corticosteroids for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis involving the face, including the eyelids, neck, and skin folds .\n【56】 Available formulations – Tacrolimus ointment comes in two strengths: 0.1% and 0.03%. Both are approved for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis but are frequently used for milder disease as well. Topical tacrolimus 0.1% is approved for patients >16 years in the United States, Canada, and Europe but has been extensively used off-label in younger children. The 0.03% formulation is approved for children ≥2 years but has been widely used off-label in younger children over the past 20 years.\n【57】 Administration – Tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream are applied twice daily to the affected areas.\n【58】 Efficacy – Topical tacrolimus 0.1% is equal in strength to a medium-potency (group 4  topical corticosteroid; topical tacrolimus 0.03% is equal in strength to a group 4 to 5 topical corticosteroid . Pimecrolimus 1% cream is comparable in efficacy to a low-potency topical corticosteroid and is slightly less effective than tacrolimus 0.03% .\n【59】 The efficacy of topical calcineurin inhibitors has been demonstrated in several randomized trials and systematic reviews . Tacrolimus ointment (particularly the 0.1% preparation) may be more effective than pimecrolimus cream, although it may also cause greater local irritation.\n【60】 A meta-analysis of 25 randomized trials that included nearly 7000 patients showed that tacrolimus 0.1% was more effective than vehicle for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis . Both tacrolimus 0.03% and 0.1% were more effective than hydrocortisone acetate 1%. Tacrolimus 0.1% was comparable in efficacy with hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1%, but tacrolimus 0.03% was less effective. Pimecrolimus was more effective than vehicle in the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis and in preventing flares but was less effective than betamethasone valerate 0.1%. None of the included trials compared pimecrolimus with topical hydrocortisone.\n【61】 In a subsequent meta-analysis of four randomized trials comparing tacrolimus with pimecrolimus in more than 1800 patients with atopic dermatitis, tacrolimus 0.1% ointment was more effective than pimecrolimus 1% cream after six weeks of therapy in adult patients (relative risk 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.72) . Tacrolimus 0.03% was superior to pimecrolimus 1% (relative risk 0.65, 95% CI 0.57-0.75) in children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, but the two agents were equally effective in those with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis.\n【62】 In a meta-analysis of 31 randomized trials, pimecrolimus was significantly better than vehicle in preventing flares at six months . However, pimecrolimus was less effective than medium-potency topical corticosteroids (triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% and betamethasone valerate 0.1%) and tacrolimus 0.1%.\n【63】 Adverse effects – Transient burning, stinging, erythema, and pruritus at the application site are the only adverse effects (including in real world experience) . Because burning and stinging are more intense when applied to severely inflamed skin, a topical corticosteroid is often used first for several days to reduce inflammation before introducing a topical calcineurin inhibitor. Tacrolimus 0.03% or pimecrolimus 0.1% are generally better tolerated than tacrolimus 0.1%. Refrigerating topical calcineurin tube for 15 to 20 minutes prior to skin application may reduce the burning sensation\n【64】 Safety – Because of early concerns raised by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about a theoretical link between the use of topical tacrolimus and pimecrolimus and cancer (particularly lymphoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer), based on the cancer risk associated with systemic tacrolimus at immunosuppressive doses , this group of topical immunomodulators was given a boxed warning. However, randomized trials in adults and children  and several long-term studies have shown no evidence of a link to internal malignancies or skin cancer . In 2021, the boxed warning was removed in Canada, but it remains in the United States.\n【65】 The results of additional safety studies are summarized below:\n【66】 The Pediatric Eczema Elective Registry (PEER) is an industry-sponsored, ongoing, cohort study established in 2004 as part of the postmarketing commitments for the approval of pimecrolimus to evaluate the risk of malignancy in children. Among 7500 children enrolled between 2004 and 2014, five malignancies (two leukemias, one osteosarcoma, and two lymphomas) were reported . The standardized incidence ratio, based upon the age-standardized Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results R) Program population, was 1.2 (95% CI 0.5-2.8) for all malignancies, 2.9 (95% CI 0.7-11.7) for lymphoma, and 2.0 (95% CI 0.5-8.2) for leukemia. Although the excess risk of lymphoma and leukemia is not statistically significant, the authors acknowledge that the small sample size and the resulting wide confidence interval may not allow the exclusion of all risk.\n【67】 A 2015 meta-analysis did not find a statistically significant association between the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors and risk of lymphoma , although an included cohort study reported a fivefold increased risk of T cell lymphoma in patients exposed to topical tacrolimus (relative risk 5.44, 95% CI 2.51-11.79) .\n【68】 A 2018 European, multicenter, cohort study that included more than 147,000 adults and children initiating tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, nearly 600,000 users of topical corticosteroids, and 257,000 untreated subjects found an increased risk of lymphoma (of borderline statistical significance) associated with tacrolimus compared with topical corticosteroids in children but not in adults (incidence rate ratio 3.74, 95% CI 1.00-14.06 and incidence rate ratio 1.76, 95% CI 0.81-3.79, respectively) .\n【69】 A 2020 international, cohort study of nearly 8000 children (mean age at enrollment 7.1 years) with atopic dermatitis exposed to tacrolimus ointment before the age of 16 years did not demonstrate an increased incidence of any cancers among tacrolimus users compared with the general population (standardized incidence ratio 1, 95% CI 0.37-2.20) . There were no instances of lymphoma.\n【70】 A 2021 meta-analysis of eight cohort studies with more than 400,000 treated participants and more than 1,700,000 controls and three case-control studies with nearly 4000 cases and 14,000 controls found no association between the use of topical calcineurin inhibitors and cancer overall . However, the risk of lymphoma was higher among patients treated with topical calcineurin inhibitors compared with controls treated with either vehicle or topical corticosteroids (risk ratio 1.86, 95% CI 1.39-2.49 and risk ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.13-1.61, respectively).\n【71】 Off-label use in infants – In the absence of long-term studies evaluating their efficacy and safety compared with low- or mid-potency topical corticosteroids, both tacrolimus and pimecrolimus have been used off-label in children as first-line treatment for atopic dermatitis and in children <2 years . Several studies have demonstrated their safety in this age group .\n【72】 A five-year, randomized trial evaluated the safety and long-term efficacy of pimecrolimus 1% cream compared with low-potency (1% hydrocortisone) or medium-potency (0.1% hydrocortisone butyrate) topical corticosteroids in more than 2400 infants 3 to 12 months of age with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis . At five years, the overall treatment success, measured by an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score, was achieved in approximately 89 percent of children in the pimecrolimus group and in 92 percent of children in the topical corticosteroid group. Vaccine responsiveness, growth, immune function, and cancer rates were similar in the two groups. The overall rates of adverse events were also similar in the two groups, although episodes of bronchitis, infected eczema, impetigo, and nasopharyngitis were slightly more frequent in the pimecrolimus group. Since the rates of cutaneous adverse events (eg, skin irritation, atrophy, telangiectasias) were not reported in this trial, the advantage of using pimecrolimus rather than low- to mid-potency topical corticosteroids for infants with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis remains unclear.\n【73】 Other topical treatments\n【74】 Crisaborole — Crisaborole is a boron-based, small molecule, topical phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor approved by the FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in adults and children three months of age and older .\n【75】 Administration – Crisaborole 2% ointment is applied twice daily to the affected areas.\n【76】 Efficacy – In two phase 3, multicenter, randomized trials that included 1522 patients ≥2 years of age with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis receiving crisaborole 2% ointment or vehicle twice daily for 28 days, more patients in the crisaborole groups than in the vehicle groups achieved an investigator global assessment (IGA) score of clear/almost clear at day 29 (32.8 and 31.4 percent versus 25.4 and 18.0 percent ) . Crisaborole-related adverse events occurred in 4.4 percent of patients and were limited to burning or stinging at the site of application.\n【77】 In a 48-week, open-label, extension study that included 517 patients (60 percent children) who had completed the trials above, adverse events, most frequently exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, burning/stinging, and infection at the application site occurred in 10 percent of patients . Diarrhea or vomiting, side effects observed with oral PDE4 inhibitors, were reported by 1 to 2 percent of patients throughout the study. Rescue therapy with topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors was needed by 22 percent of children, 26 percent and adolescents, and 13 percent of adults. Although crisaborole seems to be generally safe for long-term use, its efficacy remains uncertain due to the strong placebo effect noted in trials .\n【78】 Adverse effects – In clinical practice, the burning and stinging associated with application is reported much more frequently. In a retrospective study of 41 patients using crisaborole for atopic dermatitis, 32 percent reported skin pain . To increase tolerance, a topical corticosteroid can be used for a few days before starting crisaborole. Refrigerating the medication tube or diluting crisaborole with an emollient may help decreasing pain at the application site. Regardless, the high incidence of application-related discomfort decreases compliance and can preclude use.\n【79】 Systemic exposure to crisaborole has been shown to be limited even after maximal use (3 mg/cm2) .\n【80】 Topical ruxolitinib — Topical ruxolitinib 1.5% is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor (JAK1/2) approved in September 2021 by the US FDA for the short-term treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis in immunocompetent patients older than 12 years whose disease is not controlled with topical prescription therapies.\n【81】 Administration – Topical ruxolitinib is applied twice daily to affected areas of the skin.\n【82】 Efficacy – The efficacy of topical ruxolitinib was evaluated in two eight-week, randomized, phase 3 trials with identical design (TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD2) that included 631 and 618 adolescent and adult patients, respectively, with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (IGA score of 2/3) involving up to 20 percent of the body area surface . Patients were treated with 0.75% ruxolitinib cream, 1.5% ruxolitinib cream, or vehicle twice daily. At eight weeks, more patients in the ruxolitinib groups than in the vehicle group achieved the primary endpoint of an IGA score of 0/1 (clear or almost clear) in both trials (50 and 39 percent, respectively, in the 0.75% cream groups; 54 and 51 percent, respectively, in the 1.5% cream groups; and 15 and 8 percent, respectively, in the vehicle group). More patients in both ruxolitinib groups than in the vehicle group achieved a 75 percent reduction in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) and a clinically relevant reduction in pruritus. Adverse events occurred in approximately 30 percent of patients in each group. Burning and pruritus at application site, upper respiratory infection, and headache were the most common.\n【83】 Safety – Although topical ruxolitinib appears promising for the short-term management of atopic dermatitis, data on long-term safety and potential adverse effects due to systemic absorption are lacking. A pharmacokinetic study performed in the setting of TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD2 found that at eight weeks the mean steady state plasma concentrations of ruxolitinib after applications of 0.75% and 1.5% cream were low (<20 percent of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration for JAK2 inhibition in human whole blood assays), and the drug bioavailability was approximately 6 percent . Nonetheless, a boxed warning for serious infections, major cardiovascular events, thrombosis, malignancies, and all-cause mortality, reflecting the risk of patients taking JAK inhibitors orally (and specifically tofacitinib in older adults with rheumatoid arthritis), was issued for topical ruxolitinib.\n【84】 Topical delgocitinib — Delgocitinib is a topical pan-JAK inhibitor that is approved in Japan (0.5% ointment) for adult patients with atopic dermatitis.\n【85】 Experimental topical therapies — Several topical therapies are in clinical trials for treating atopic dermatitis.\n【86】 Roflumilast – Roflumilast is a topical PDE4 inhibitor that is reportedly more potent than crisaborole and without the associated stinging or burning. In a pivotal phase 3, four-week, randomized trial evaluating roflumilast 0.15% cream once daily in patients ≥6 years, more patients in the roflumilast group than in the vehicle group achieved the primary endpoint of IGA 0/1 with a two-grade improvement from baseline (32 versus 15 percent, respectively) .\n【87】 Tapinarof – Tapinarof is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonist that has been shown to improve barrier function, reduce inflammation, and reduce itch. In a phase 2, dose-finding trial in patients aged 12 to 65 years with atopic dermatitis, more patients receiving tapinarof 1% cream twice daily achieved an IGA score of 0/1 at week 12, compared with dose receiving vehicle (53 versus 24 percent) . Similar results were seen in a subsequent phase 2b randomized trial in adolescents and adults with atopic dermatitis .\n【88】 Topical formulations of roflumilast and tapinarof were both approved by the FDA in 2022 for the treatment of plaque psoriasis.\n【89】 Topical brepocitinib – Brepocitinib is an investigative small molecule tyrosine kinase 2/JAK1 inhibitor that can block the IL-12 and IL-23 pathways. A topical formulation of brepocitinib 0.1, 0.3, 1, or 3% applied once or twice daily was evaluated in a six-week, phase 2b, randomized trial in 292 adolescents and adults with mild or moderate atopic dermatitis (mean baseline EASI score 7.3) . At six weeks, patients in the brepocitinib 1% groups had a greater mean percentage reduction of EASI score from baseline (-70 and -75 percent for once-daily and twice-daily application, respectively) compared with vehicle (-44 and -47 percent, respectively). Adverse events occurred in 34 percent of patients, with the most common being nasopharyngitis and worsening of atopic dermatitis. Plasma levels of brepocitinib were generally low but showed a dose-related increase.\n【90】 Bacteriotherapy – Bacteriotherapy using the commensal organism Staphylococcus hominis A9 (ShA9) isolated from healthy human skin has been investigated as a topical therapy for atopic dermatitis. ShA9 kills S. aureus and inhibits the expression of a staphylococcal pro-inflammatory toxin. In a phase 1 randomized trial, application of topical ShA9 versus vehicle on the forearm skin of 54 adults with S. aureus-positive atopic dermatitis for one week was shown to be safe and resulted in a significant decrease in S. aureus density and increase in ShA9 DNA .\n【91】 Assessing adherence to topical treatment — Poor adherence to prescribed topical therapies is a major cause of exacerbation of atopic dermatitis .   \"Evaluation and management of severe refractory atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults\", section on 'Identifying the causes of recalcitrant disease'.)\n【92】 Maintenance and prevention of relapses — While many patients with mild atopic dermatitis respond well to intermittent, anti-inflammatory therapy for flares, those with moderate to severe disease typically require more chronic suppression of the cutaneous immune activation. For patients with dermatitis recurring at the same limited areas, we suggest proactive, intermittent therapy with mid- to high-potency topical corticosteroids (groups 3 to 5 .\n【93】 Pooled data from four randomized trials showed that topical fluticasone propionate once daily for two consecutive days per week for 16 weeks reduced the risk of a subsequent flare by 54 percent (relative risk [RR] 0.46, 95% CI 0.38-0.55; number needed to treat [NNT] 2). No serious adverse events were reported.\n【94】 Pooled data from three randomized trials showed that topical tacrolimus once daily two to three days per week for 10 to 12 months reduced the risk of a subsequent flare by 22 percent (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60-0.78; NNT 4).\n【95】 Use of systemic corticosteroids for acute exacerbations — In general, use of systemic corticosteroids should be avoided for treatment of atopic dermatitis, given their many adverse effects, the high risk of rebound on discontinuation, and the availability of newer systemic therapies that are safer than conventional immunosuppressants .   \"Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids\" and  \"Management of severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in children\", section on 'Systemic corticosteroids'.)\n【96】 PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE DISEASE\n【97】 Our approach — Patients with persistent, moderate to severe disease despite optimal topical therapy require a systemic treatment to achieve adequate disease control . Before starting systemic therapies, it is good clinical practice to re-evaluate patients to exclude concurrent diseases or reactions that may influence response (eg, infection, contact dermatitis) and to confirm the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.\n【98】 We suggest dupilumab or tralokinumab as first-line therapy for most adult and pediatric patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis that is not controlled by topical therapies.\n【99】 Oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors (abrocitinib, upadacitinib, baricitinib) may be considered for short-term treatment in select patients who do not have contraindications to their use (eg, age >65 years, cardiovascular risk factors, previous cancer, previous major adverse cardiovascular events, or thromboembolic event) in the following situations:\n【100】 Control of seasonal flares\n【101】 Atopic dermatitis that does not respond to biologics\n【102】 Patients who have concomitant alopecia areata or vitiligo\n【103】 Narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) phototherapy, if available and acceptable to the patient, is an alternative first-line therapy in combination with topical corticosteroids for adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis  'Phototherapy' below). Phototherapy is generally not suitable for infants and young children. Disadvantages of phototherapy include cost, the need for multiple office visits per week and related risk of poor adherence, and poor tolerance when the skin is very inflamed.\n【104】 Phototherapy — NBUVB is a treatment option for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents    \"UVB phototherapy (broadband and narrowband)\"):\n【105】 Administration – Phototherapy is usually administered in the office two to three times per week. Topical corticosteroids are typically continued as needed during phototherapy. Additional emollients may be necessary, since phototherapy may increase skin dryness. An alternative to office-based phototherapy is the use of a home ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy unit prescribed by the treating clinician. However, insurance coverage of these units varies.   \"Treatment of psoriasis in adults\", section on 'Home phototherapy'.)\n【106】 Efficacy – Phototherapy for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis has been evaluated in a several randomized trials and systematic reviews. In a 2021 systematic review of 32 randomized trials that included 1219 patients, NBUVB was effective in reducing the clinical signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis . Observational studies indicate that NBUVB is associated with long-term remission and reduced use of topical corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, and antihistamines .\n【107】 Adverse effects – Short-term adverse effects of UVB phototherapy include erythema, skin dryness, pruritus, blistering, and increased frequency of recurrent herpes simplex. Data are conflicting on whether prolonged exposure leads to an increased risk of melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer, but the risk is assumed to be very small  .\n【108】 Systemic therapies\n【109】 Biologic agents\n【110】 Dupilumab — Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to the alpha subunit of the IL-4 receptor and inhibits downstream signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, cytokines of T helper type 2 (Th2) lymphocytes that play a key role in atopic diseases (including asthma and atopic dermatitis). In the United States and Europe, dupilumab is approved for the treatment of adults and children aged six months and older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis that is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies; in Canada, it is approved for adults and children older than six years . Compared with conventional immunosuppressive agents, dupilumab has a favorable safety profile and may be used for long-term treatment of atopic dermatitis . However, cost and access may limit its use. In some cases, contact allergy testing may be required for patients prior to initiation.\n【111】 Administration – Dupilumab is administered as subcutaneous injections every two to four weeks. In adults, an initial dose of 600 mg is followed by a maintenance dose of 300 mg every other week. In children ≥6 months and in adolescents, dosing is based on body weight .\n【112】 Concurrent use of topical therapies – Topical corticosteroids and other topical agents are usually continued as needed during treatment with dupilumab unless they are no longer needed to maintain disease control.\n【113】 Efficacy — Multiple randomized trials in adults and children have documented dupilumab efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis:\n【114】 A network meta-analysis of 74 randomized trials with more than 8000 participants indicated (with a high degree of certainty) dupilumab as the most effective treatment in achieving a 75 percent reduction in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) score (risk ratio 3.04, 95% CI 2.51-3.69) and improving the Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) score (mean difference 7.3, 95% CI 6.61-8.00) during short-term follow-up when compared with placebo . Dupilumab was also ranked first among other investigational and noninvestigational biologics in terms of achieving EASI-75 and improving POEM scores during short-term follow-up. However, due to the lack of comparative data, the ranking of conventional immunosuppressive treatments for efficacy compared with dupilumab and other biologic agents remained uncertain.\n【115】 Studies in adults:\n【116】 Dupilumab 300 mg or placebo given by subcutaneous injection weekly or every other week was evaluated in two, phase 3 randomized trials of identical design (SOLO1 and SOLO2) that included 671 and 708 adult patients, respectively, with longstanding, moderate to severe atopic dermatitis uncontrolled by topical treatments . At 16 weeks, more patients on dupilumab achieved the primary endpoint of an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of clear or almost clear (approximately 40 versus 10 percent) compared with placebo. There were no differences between trials and between weekly or biweekly dupilumab regimens. An EASI-75 score was achieved by 44 to 52 percent of patients receiving dupilumab versus 12 to 15 percent of those receiving placebo. Rescue treatment was required in approximately 50 percent of patients receiving placebo and 15 to 20 percent of those receiving dupilumab. Serious adverse events were rare in all groups. However, injection site reactions and conjunctivitis occurred more frequently in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo group.\n【117】 In the SOLO1 and SOLO2 trials, patients who failed to achieve IGA score of clear or almost clear with dupilumab at week 16  often had greater improvement in secondary outcome measures, including pruritus (numerical rating scale -35 versus -9 percent) and quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI] score ≥4-point improvement, 59 versus 24 percent) .\n【118】 The long-term efficacy and safety of dupilumab was subsequently evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial (LIBERTY AD CHRONOS) . In this study, 740 patients were treated with dupilumab 300 mg once weekly, dupilumab 300 mg every two weeks, or placebo for 52 weeks. All patients received concurrent treatment with topical corticosteroids (or topical calcineurin inhibitors, if indicated) and were allowed to receive rescue treatments (topical or systemic medications or phototherapy) after two weeks of dupilumab. The two coprimary endpoints were the proportion of patients with both an IGA score of 0/1 (clear/almost clear) or a two-point or higher reduction from baseline at week 52 and the proportion of patients achieving EASI-75 from baseline to week 52. At week 52, more patients in the dupilumab plus topical corticosteroids groups achieved the IGA endpoint and EASI-75 compared with those receiving placebo plus topical corticosteroids (approximately 40 versus 13 percent, and 65 versus 22 percent, respectively). The rates of adverse events were similar in the three groups (83 to 88 percent). However, patients in the dupilumab groups experienced an approximately twofold higher frequency of eye disorders and noninfectious conjunctivitis.\n【119】 An open-label, extension study of patients enrolled in previous randomized trials who continued treatment with dupilumab 300 mg weekly confirmed a sustained efficacy of dupilumab, with more than 60 percent of patients achieving a 90 percent reduction in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-90) score at 56 and 76 weeks . Approximately 50 percent of patients received additional treatment with topical corticosteroids (44 percent) and topical calcineurin inhibitors (13 percent). Four percent of patients required rescue systemic therapy.\n【120】 In a study evaluating the efficacy of dupilumab in 138 consecutive adult patients with difficult-to-treat atopic dermatitis in a real-life setting, treatment with dupilumab for 16 weeks induced a mean reduction of the EASI score of 73 percent . A 50 percent reduction in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-50), EASI-75, and EASI-90 scores was achieved by 86, 62, and 24 percent of patients, respectively. Improvement also occurred in patient-reported outcomes, including POEM score, pruritus, and quality of life. The most frequent adverse effects were conjunctivitis and eye irritation in 34 and 25 percent of patients, respectively .\n【121】 Studies in children and adolescents:\n【122】 In a phase 3, randomized trial, 251 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were treated with dupilumab 200 or 300 mg every two weeks, dupilumab 300 mg every four weeks, or placebo for 16 weeks . Most participants had associated comorbidities, including allergic rhinitis (66 percent), asthma (54 percent), and food allergy (61 percent). The coprimary endpoints (proportion of patients with ≥75 percent improvement from baseline in the EASI and an IGA score of 0/1 [clear or almost clear]) were achieved by a higher proportion of patients in both the every-two-weeks and every-four-weeks groups compared with the placebo group (EASI-75: 42, 38, and 8 percent, respectively; IGA 0/1: 24, 18, and 2 percent, respectively). The most common adverse events were worsening of atopic dermatitis, skin infection, upper respiratory infection, and conjunctivitis. The last was more frequent in the dupilumab groups than in the placebo group (10 to 11 versus 5 percent, respectively).\n【123】 A 16-week, phase 3, randomized trial examined the efficacy and safety of dupilumab plus topical corticosteroids in children . In this study, 367 children aged 6 to 11 years with severe atopic dermatitis inadequately controlled with topical medications were treated with dupilumab 300 mg every four weeks, a weight-based regimen of 100 to 200 mg every two weeks, or placebo, in combination with a medium-potency topical corticosteroid. More patients in the dupilumab 300 mg and 100 or 200 mg groups achieved the coprimary endpoints (IGA score of 0 to 1 or EASI-75) at week 16 than in the placebo group (33, 30, and 11 percent; and 67, 70, and 27 percent, respectively). Adverse events occurred in 73 percent of patients in the placebo group and in 65 to 67 percent of patients in the dupilumab groups. Injection site reactions and conjunctivitis were more common with dupilumab.\n【124】 A 16-week, phase 3, randomized trial examined the efficacy and safety of dupilumab given at the dose of 200 mg if 5 to <15 kg or 300 mg if 15 to <30 kg plus a very low-potency topical corticosteroid in 162 children aged six months to six years . At 16 weeks, more patients in the dupilumab group than in the placebo group achieved the primary endpoint of IGA 0/1 (28 versus 4 percent). Approximately 10 percent of patients in the dupilumab group experienced conjunctivitis. Both groups had similar incidences of injection site reactions. Across various ages, the frequency of skin infections in the group on placebo was approximately twice that with dupilumab.\n【125】 A phase 3, open-label extension study provided long-term data on dupilumab treatment in 294 adolescents . By 52 weeks, 43 percent of patients on 300 mg of dupilumab every two or four weeks had an IGA score of 0/1 and 29 percent had maintained IGA 0/1 for 12 consecutive weeks (weeks 40 to 52), after which dupilumab was discontinued per protocol. After a mean of 18 weeks, 57 percent of patients relapsed and required dupilumab reinitiation.\n【126】 Postapproval studies have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 blockade reduces skin infections and S. aureus colonization, and improves atopic comorbidities .\n【127】 Adverse effects — Frequent adverse effects of dupilumab include injection site reactions, conjunctivitis, and facial redness. Eosinophilia is frequent, often starting approximately four weeks after dupilumab initiation and tends to decrease by 16 weeks. Increased frequency of herpes simplex virus infection was reported in some but not all trials. A psoriasis-like eruption, development of psoriasis during therapy, and arthritis have been rarely reported . Concomitant treatment of these adverse events often allows for dupilumab continuation. Of note, no worsening or progression to a generalized reaction has been noted upon continuation of dupilumab therapy.\n【128】 Ocular adverse effects – Ocular surface disease induced by dupilumab has been reported in approximately 11 percent of patients with atopic dermatitis participating in randomized trials of dupilumab and in up to 26 percent of patients in prospective or real-life studies . Ocular surface disease includes conjunctivitis and, infrequently, keratitis, eye dryness, burning or stinging, pruritus, blepharitis, and blurred vision . In most cases, ocular surface disease appeared in the first weeks or months of treatment, was generally mild or moderate, and resolved with continued dupilumab treatment .\n【129】 Dupilumab facial redness – Exacerbation or new onset of head and neck dermatitis (\"dupilumab facial redness\") has been reported in approximately 4 to 10 percent of adult patients treated with dupilumab after a median time of 65 days after initiating dupilumab . This reaction has also been reported in up to 29 percent of children and adolescents treated with dupilumab . In a Danish real-world study, head and neck dermatitis was still present in most patients after 104 weeks of treatment .\n【130】 The pathogenesis of dupilumab-induced head and neck dermatitis is unclear. It may represent site-specific treatment failure, unmasking of existing allergic contact dermatitis or psoriasis , topical steroid withdrawal , dupilumab-induced Malassezia hypersensitivity reaction, or Demodex proliferation resulting in rosacea. Patch testing can be helpful to uncover potential contact allergens.\n【131】 Topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, topical and systemic antifungals, and ivermectin have been used in a few patients with dupilumab facial redness with variable results .\n【132】 Seronegative arthritis and enthesitis/enthesopathy – There have been several reports of inflammatory arthritis and enthesitis associated with dupilumab treatment, in most cases occurring during the first few months of treatment . It has been hypothesized that the blockade of IL-4 and IL-13, critical cytokines of the Th2 immune response, may activate the IL-23/IL-17 axis, resulting in the paradoxical emergence of T helper type 17 (Th17) diseases, including spondyloarthropathy-pattern arthritis and occasional anterior uveitis.\n【133】 An analysis of nearly 38,000 dupilumab adverse reactions reported to VigiBase (the World Health Organization's global pharmacovigilance database of adverse drug reactions) found that musculoskeletal and connective tissue were the third most affected systems (n = 3452, 9.1 percent) . Specifically, dupilumab was associated with diseases sharing Th17 immunogenetics, including seronegative arthritis (odds ratio 9.6, 95% CI 3.1-30.1), enthesitis/enthesopathy (odds ratio 12.7, 95% CI 6.5-24.5), and iridocyclitis (odds ratio 3.8, 95% CI 1.0-7.6). Dupilumab was not associated with humoral-mediated autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and scleroderma. These data suggest that all patients initiating treatment with dupilumab should be counseled about the risk of new-onset joint pain, and that if it occurs, it is generally mild and can be conservatively managed without a need to discontinue dupilumab .\n【134】 Psoriasis/psoriasiform dermatitis – Suppression of the Th2 pathway in patients with atopic dermatitis may lead to the development of psoriasis in predisposed patients, due to a shift towards a skewed Th1/Th17 pathway. There is some thought that this reaction is distinct from classical psoriasis . In a postapproval systematic review, 47 adult patients on dupilumab developed psoriasis at a median time of 3.7 months after its initiation . Nearly one-half (48 percent) discontinued dupilumab, leading to complete resolution in 40 percent and variable improvement in another 48 percent with use of typical psoriasis treatments. In a pediatric retrospective review, six children developed psoriasiform lesions at a median time of eight months after dupilumab initiation . Most experienced full clearance of their psoriasiform lesions with the initiation of concomitant topical corticosteroids and continuation of dupilumab, suggesting that the management in adults versus children is different.\n【135】 Diagnosis of mycosis fungoides following dupilumab treatment — There are several reports of patients who were treated with dupilumab for atopic dermatitis and were subsequently diagnosed with mycosis fungoides or Sézary syndrome . A 2023 systematic review found 11 reports with 23 cases (19 adults with onset of atopic dermatitis during adulthood) diagnosed with mycosis fungoides/Sézary syndrome after treatment with dupilumab for presumed atopic dermatitis . Dupilumab has also been associated with the rapid progression of mycosis fungoides in patients with mycosis fungoides who received off-label dupilumab for the management of pruritus associated with mycosis fungoides .\n【136】 Tralokinumab — Tralokinumab is a fully human monoclonal anti-IL-13 antibody. It is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis that is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies in adults, in the United States, and in adults and adolescents 12 years and older in Europe.\n【137】 Administration – In adults, tralokinumab is administered subcutaneously with a loading dose of 600 mg followed by 300 mg every other week.\n【138】 Efficacy – The efficacy of tralokinumab as monotherapy or in combination with topical corticosteroids has been evaluated in several randomized trials:\n【139】 In two identical, randomized trials (ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2), 1596 adult patients with atopic dermatitis who were candidates for systemic therapy received subcutaneous tralokinumab 300 mg as monotherapy or placebo every other week for 16 weeks . An IGA score of 0/1 (clear/almost clear) was achieved by 16 and 22 percent of patients in the tralokinumab groups in ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2, respectively, compared with 7 and 11 percent of patients in the placebo groups, respectively. EASI-75 was achieved by 25 and 33 percent of patients in the tralokinumab groups, respectively, versus 13 and 11 percent of those in the placebo groups, respectively. Tralokinumab was also more effective than placebo in reducing the Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score, improving pruritus, and improving quality of life. The majority of tralokinumab responders at week 16 maintained response at week 52 with continued treatment. Adverse events, most commonly atopic dermatitis flares and viral upper respiratory infections, occurred with similar frequency in the tralokinumab and placebo groups and were nonserious in most cases. Conjunctivitis was two- to over threefold more common in patients receiving tralokinumab compared with those receiving placebo.\n【140】 In the ECZTRA 3 trial, 380 patients were treated with tralokinumab 300 mg every two weeks or placebo in combination with a mid-potency topical corticosteroid (mometasone furoate 0.1%) applied as needed . At 16 weeks, more patients in the tralokinumab group than in the placebo group achieved an IGA score of 0/1 (39 versus 26 percent, respectively) and EASI-75 (56 versus 36 percent, respectively). The overall frequency of adverse events, including viral upper respiratory infection, headache, and exacerbation of atopic dermatitis (in most cases mild or moderate), was similar in both groups. Conjunctivitis was more common in patients receiving tralokinumab than in those receiving placebo (11.1 versus 3.2 percent, respectively). Similar trends were observed with concomitant topical corticosteroid use in the ECZTRA 7 trial of adults who were previously on cyclosporine therapy.\n【141】 In the ECZTRA 6 study that included patients aged 12 to 17 years with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, more patients receiving tralokinumab 150 or 300 mg achieved than those receiving placebo achieved an IGA score of 0/1 (21.4 and 17.5 percent, respectively, versus 4.3 percent) and EASI-75 (28.6 and 27.8 percent, respectively, versus 6.4 percent) by week 16 . Similar to adult studies, the most common adverse events were viral upper respiratory tract infections, exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, injection site reactions, asthma, and headache. Conjunctivitis occurred in 3 to 4 percent of patients taking tralokinumab versus 2 percent of patients taking placebo.\n【142】 In a network meta-analysis of 60 randomized trials with over 16,000 participants, tralokinumab at the approved dosing of 600 then 300 mg every two weeks was found to be slightly less effective than dupilumab in reducing EASI at the same dose during 16 weeks .\n【143】 Adverse events – In a pooled analysis of five randomized trials with 2285 participants, adverse events occurred with similar frequencies in the tralokinumab and placebo groups (66 and 67 percent, respectively) . The most common adverse events occurring with higher frequency with tralokinumab than with placebo included: viral upper respiratory tract infection (15.7 versus 12.2 percent); conjunctivitis (5.4 versus 1.9 percent); and injection-site reaction (3.5. versus 0.3 percent). Skin infections requiring systemic treatment occurred with lower frequency in the tralokinumab groups, compared with placebo groups (2.6 versus 5.5 percent).\n【144】 Experimental biologics — Lebrikizumab, nemolizumab, eblasakimab, and OX40/OX40L targeting biologics are being evaluated for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in clinical trials.\n【145】 Lebrikizumab – Lebrikizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to soluble IL-13 .\n【146】 In a phase 3, randomized trial that included 211 adults and adolescent patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, more patients receiving subcutaneous lebrikizumab (loading dose of 500 mg at baseline and week 2, followed by 250 mg every two weeks thereafter) in combination with low- to mid-potency topical corticosteroids achieved an IGA score of 0/1 at week 16 than those receiving placebo plus topical corticosteroids (41 and 22 percent, respectively) . Adverse events were more frequent in the lebrikizumab group than in the placebo group (43 versus 35 percent) and included conjunctivitis, headache, herpes infection, hypertension, and injection site reaction.\n【147】 In two identical phase 3 randomized trials (ADvocate1 and ADvocate2) that included a total of 851 adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis receiving lebrikizumab (loading dose of 500 mg at baseline followed by 250 mg every other week) or placebo, more patients in the lebrikizumab groups than in the placebo groups achieved an IGA score of 0/1 at week 16 (43 and 33 percent versus 13 and 11 percent, respectively) . Lebrikizumab-related adverse events included conjunctivitis and mild eosinophilia.\n【148】 In a 52-week extension study of the ADvocate1 and ADvocate2 trials, 71 percent of patients receiving lebrikizumab 250 mg every two weeks, 77 percent of those receiving lebrikizumab 250 mg every four weeks, and 48 percent of those receiving placebo maintained an IGA score of 0/1 . Treatment-related adverse effects included worsening of atopic dermatitis (9 percent), conjunctivitis (8 percent), and nasopharyngitis (8 percent).\n【149】 Eblasakimab – Eblasakimab is an IL-13R-alpha-1 monoclonal antibody that is being evaluated in a phase 2b randomized trial for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients.\n【150】 Nemolizumab – Nemolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the receptor of IL-31, a cytokine known to be associated with pruritus via IL-31 receptor activation . Several studies indicate that nemolizumab may be effective in controlling pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis .\n【151】 A phase 2, 12-week, randomized trial evaluated the efficacy of nemolizumab for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis not controlled by topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors . In this study, 264 patients received subcutaneous nemolizumab at a dose of 0.1, 0.5, or 2 mg per kg of body weight or placebo every four weeks or nemolizumab at a dose of 2 mg per kg every eight weeks with placebo given at week 4. At 12 weeks, pruritus was reduced by 44, 60, and 63 percent in the 0.1, 0.5, and 2 mg groups, respectively, versus 21 percent in the placebo group. The body surface area affected by atopic dermatitis decreased by 8, 20, and 19 percent in the 0.1, 0.5, and 2 mg groups, respectively, compared with 16 percent in the placebo group. Adverse events occurred in approximately 70 percent of patients in all study groups and were generally mild, with the most frequent being exacerbation of atopic dermatitis and respiratory tract infections.\n【152】 The efficacy of nemolizumab in reducing pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis was confirmed in a subsequent Japanese randomized trial that included 215 patients aged 13 years or older with atopic dermatitis and moderate to severe pruritus . Patients received subcutaneous nemolizumab 60 mg or placebo every four weeks for 16 weeks plus topical therapy for atopic dermatitis (eg, medium-potency topical glucocorticoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors). At week 16, the least squares mean of the pruritus visual analogue scale score (primary endpoint) was reduced by 43 percent in the nemolizumab group compared with 21 percent in the placebo group. Adverse events occurred in 71 percent of patients in both groups and were generally mild. In the nemolizumab group, four treatment-related adverse events (atopic dermatitis exacerbation, Meniere disease, alopecia, and peripheral edema) occurred in three patients.\n【153】 Although nemolizumab appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis and the interruption of the itch-scratch cycle, larger studies of longer durations are needed to evaluate its long-term efficacy and safety.\n【154】 Agents targeting OX40/OX40L – Agents that bind to OX40, a costimulatory receptor on activated T cells (telazorlimab/GBR 830 and rocatinlimab/AMG 451/KHK4083) or to the OX40 ligand (amlitelimab) have been evaluated in phase 2 studies in adults with promising results .\n【155】 JAK inhibitors — Given their ability to suppress multiple immune pathways, JAK inhibitors provide more rapid improvement in signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis, compared with biologics. Oral administration is an additional advantage of systemic JAK inhibitors over biologics, which require subcutaneous injection. However, because of the potential risk of associated serious adverse events, benefits and risks should be carefully evaluated in the individual patient prior to initiating treatment with oral JAK inhibitors.\n【156】 Abrocitinib — Abrocitinib is an oral Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) selective inhibitor approved in Europe, the United States, and Japan for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults whose disease is not controlled with other systemic therapies (including biologics) or when the use of those therapies is not indicated. In the United States, abrocitinib is also approved for children ≥12 years.\n【157】 Administration – Abrocitinib is administered orally at a dose of 100 mg daily, with the option to increase to 200 mg daily if there is an inadequate response.\n【158】 Efficacy – Several randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of abrocitinib in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. In head-to-head trials, abrocitinib 100 mg daily showed efficacy similar to that of dupilumab.\n【159】 In a phase 3, randomized trial, 387 patients aged 12 years or older with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis received oral abrocitinib 100 mg, abrocitinib 200 mg, or placebo once daily for 12 weeks . At 12 weeks, more patients in the abrocitinib 100 and 200 mg groups than in the placebo group achieved the IGA of clear or almost clear (24, 44, and 8 percent, respectively) and an EASI-75 response (40, 63, and 12 percent, respectively). Adverse events, including exacerbation of atopic dermatitis, nasopharyngitis, nausea, and headache, were reported in 69 and 78 percent of patients in the 100 and 200 mg abrocitinib groups, respectively, and in 57 percent of patients in the placebo group.\n【160】 In a 16-week, phase 3, randomized trial, 838 adult patients with atopic dermatitis unresponsive to topical treatments were randomized to receive abrocitinib 200 mg daily, abrocitinib 100 mg daily, dupilumab 300 mg subcutaneously every other week (after a loading dose of 600 mg), or placebo . All patients also received topical therapy. An IGA response of clear or almost clear at week 12 was observed in 48, 37, 37, and 14 percent of participants in the 200 mg abrocitinib group, 100 mg abrocitinib group, dupilumab group, and placebo group, respectively. An EASI-75 response at week 12 was observed in 70, 59, 58, and 27 percent of participants, respectively. The overall rate of adverse events was higher in the 200 mg abrocitinib group than in the other groups; the most frequent were nausea, acne, headache, and nasopharyngitis.\n【161】 In a 26-week, phase 3, randomized trial that included 727 patients comparing abrocitinib 200 mg daily with dupilumab 300 mg every other week, more patients in the abrocitinib group achieved the primary outcomes of a four-point or higher improvement in the Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale at week 2 (48 versus 26 percent; difference 22.6 percent, 95% CI 15.8-29.5) and EASI-90 at week 4 (29 versus 15 percent; difference 14.1 percent, 95% CI 8.2-20.05) . However, the differences between the two treatments were not statistically significant at week 26. Adverse effects occurred in 74 percent of patients in the abrocitinib group and included two fatalities (COVID-19 infection and cardiorespiratory arrest and intracranial hemorrhage). Serious adverse effects in the dupilumab group included nephrotic syndrome in one patient and rhabdomyolysis in another patient.\n【162】 In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in 256 adolescents (JADE TEEN), 46.2 percent of patients on abrocitinib 200 mg and 41.6 percent of those on abrocitinib 100 mg achieved an IGA 0/1 response versus 24.5 percent of adolescents treated with placebo . EASI-75 response was met in 72 percent of those on abrocitinib 200 mg, 68.5 percent on abrocitinib 100 mg, and 41.5 percent on placebo. Consistently, 55.4 percent of patients on abrocitinib 200 mg reached a Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale response of at least 4 compared with 52.6 percent of patients on abrocitinib 100 mg and 29.8 percent on placebo.\n【163】 Upadacitinib — Upadacitinib is an oral selective JAK1 inhibitor approved in the United States, Europe, and other countries for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in adults and children older than 12 years whose disease is not adequately controlled with other systemic drug products (including biologics) or when the use of those therapies is inadvisable.\n【164】 Administration – Upadacitinib is administered orally at the dose of 15 mg once daily. The dose can be increased to 30 mg daily if response is not adequate.\n【165】 Efficacy – Three multicenter, randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of upadacitinib in adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis as monotherapy or in combination with topical corticosteroids versus placebo  and versus dupilumab :\n【166】 In two replicate, multicenter trials, 847 and 836 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were randomized to receive oral upadacitinib 15 or 30 mg daily or placebo as monotherapy . At 16 weeks in both studies, more patients in the upadacitinib groups achieved the primary endpoint of EASI-75 than patients in the placebo groups (60 and 70 percent in the 15 mg groups and 73 and 80 percent in the 30 mg groups versus 47 and 46 percent in the placebo groups, respectively). In both trials, the proportion of patients who had a clinically meaningful improvement in pruritus was higher in the upadacitinib groups than in placebo groups, with improvements observed by day 2 in the upadacitinib 30 mg groups and by day 3 in the upadacitinib 15 mg groups. Treatment was well tolerated. The most frequently reported, treatment-emergent adverse events were acne (up to 17 percent in the upadacitinib 30 mg groups versus 2 percent in placebo groups), upper respiratory infections, nasopharyngitis, headache, and elevation of creatine phosphokinase.\n【167】 In a separate multicenter trial, 901 adults and adolescents with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were randomized to receive upadacitinib 15 or 30 mg daily plus once-daily, moderate-potency topical corticosteroids or placebo plus once-daily, moderate-potency topical corticosteroids . At 16 weeks, more patients in the upadacitinib 15 and 30 mg plus topical corticosteroids groups achieved EASI-75 than patients in the placebo plus topical corticosteroids group (65, 77, and 26 percent, respectively). Clinically significant improvement in pruritus at week 16 occurred in 52 and 64 percent of patients in the upadacitinib groups versus 15 percent in the placebo group. Median time to discontinuation of topical corticosteroids was shorter in the upadacitinib groups than in the placebo group (88, 57, and ≥120 days, respectively). Adverse events were more frequent in the upadacitinib groups than in the placebo group.\n【168】 In a subsequent randomized trial, 692 adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were randomized to receive upadacitinib 30 mg orally once daily or subcutaneous dupilumab 300 mg every 2 weeks for 24 weeks as monotherapy . More patients in the upadacitinib group than patients in the dupilumab group achieved the primary endpoint of EASI-75 at 16 weeks (71 versus 61 percent) and the secondary endpoints of EASI-75 at 2 weeks (44 versus 17 percent), EASI-90 at 16 weeks (61 versus 39 percent), and a 100 percent reduction in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-100) at 16 weeks (28 versus 8 percent). The proportion of patients achieving a clinically significant reduction in pruritus at week 16 was also higher for those treated with upadacitinib compared with those treated with dupilumab (55 versus 36 percent). Overall, adverse events occurred in 72 percent of patients receiving upadacitinib and 63 percent of those receiving dupilumab and included acne (more frequently in the upadacitinib group), conjunctivitis (more frequently in the dupilumab group), upper respiratory infection, and worsening of atopic dermatitis. Serious infections, including herpes zoster and eczema herpeticum, were rare and occurred more frequently in the upadacitinib group. One patient in the upadacitinib group died of influenza-related pneumonia.\n【169】 Baricitinib — Baricitinib is an oral JAK1/2 selective inhibitor approved in Europe, but not in the United States, for adults with atopic dermatitis. Multiple phase 3 studies have been completed in adults with atopic dermatitis, but only one phase 3 trial has been performed in children.\n【170】 A multicenter, randomized, phase 3 trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of baricitinib combined with topical corticosteroids in children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis . In this study, 483 patients aged 2 to <18 years were randomized to once-daily oral baricitinib 1 mg equivalent (low dose), 2 mg equivalent (medium dose), 4 mg equivalent (high dose), or placebo plus low- to medium-potency topical corticosteroids. At 16 weeks, more patients in the 4 mg baricitinib group achieved a validated IGA score of 0/1 (clear/almost clear) compared with those in the placebo group (42 versus 16 percent). There was no statistically significant difference in the proportion of patients achieving an IGA score of 0/1 in the baricitinib 1 mg, 2 mg, and placebo groups (18, 26, and 16 percent, respectively). Adverse events occurred with similar frequency (approximately 50 percent in all groups) and were mild or moderate in severity. Treatment-emergent adverse events included abdominal pain, acne, and headache.\n【171】 In two 16-week, phase 3 trials (BREEZE-AD1 and BREEZE-AD2) including a total of 1239 adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, more patients treated with baricitinib 2 and 4 mg per day as monotherapy achieved a validated IGA score of 0/1 (clear or almost clear) compared with placebo (11.4, 16.8, and 4.8 percent for baricitinib 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively, in BREEZE-AD1; 10.6, 13.8, and 4.5 percent for baricitinib 2 mg, baricitinib 4 mg, and placebo, respectively, in BREEZE-AD2) . Adverse events occurred in approximately 60 percent of patients in all groups. The most frequent adverse events reported in the baricitinib groups were nasopharyngitis and headache.\n【172】 In a 52-week extension study of two randomized clinical trials (BREEZE-AD3), baricitinib 4 and 2 mg demonstrated sustained long-term efficacy in adults .\n【173】 Safety concerns — The benefit of broader immune suppression comes at the cost of more potential adverse events, which requires close clinical surveillance and diligent laboratory monitoring. Long-term studies of the safety of oral JAK inhibitors in patients with atopic dermatitis are lacking. Data from a large, randomized safety trial of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (older than 50 years of age and with cardiovascular risk factors) indicated that the pan-JAK inhibitor tofacitinib may increase the risk of serious infections, major cardiovascular events (eg, heart attack, stroke), cancer (eg, lymphoma, lung cancer), thrombosis, and death . In the United States, Canada, and Europe, warnings regarding these risks have been added to prescription drug information.\n【174】 Nontargeted immunosuppressive agents\n【175】 Cyclosporine — Oral cyclosporine is rarely used for infants and young children with atopic dermatitis. In older children and adolescents, the use of cyclosporine should be reserved for the most severe cases that failed to respond to optimal topical treatment and dupilumab and have a negative impact on quality of life. Cyclosporine is an on-label medication for adult atopic dermatitis in some European countries.   \"Management of severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in children\", section on 'Cyclosporine'.)\n【176】 Administration – Oral cyclosporine is a short-term treatment option for patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis . Cyclosporine (preferably the modified formulation) is typically given at a dose of 3 to 5 mg/kg per day in two divided doses for four to eight weeks or longer (until improvement is noted). The dose is then lowered to the minimum effective dose and maintained until stable improvement is achieved. After cyclosporine withdrawal, treatment with topical corticosteroids and emollients can be continued. Cyclosporine is best tapered before discontinuation because of a possible rebound effect.  'Topical corticosteroids' above and 'Maintenance and prevention of relapses' above.)\n【177】 Efficacy and adverse effects – The efficacy of oral cyclosporine for the treatment of atopic dermatitis has been evaluated in several randomized trials and systematic reviews. In a 2013 systematic review of 19 randomized trials, most of which considered at high risk of bias, cyclosporine was more effective than placebo in improving nonvalidated clinical scores and patient-reported scores of itch and sleep loss; in head-to-head trials, cyclosporine was superior to ultraviolet A and B phototherapy, oral prednisolone, and intravenous immunoglobulins and was equally effective as methotrexate and mycophenolate sodium .\n【178】 Adverse effects of cyclosporine include nephrotoxicity, hypertension, hypertrichosis, gum hyperplasia, and increased susceptibility to serious infections. Monitoring of patients receiving cyclosporine involves measuring blood pressure and serum creatinine every two weeks for three months, followed by monthly monitoring. Significant elevations of either are an indication to lower the dose or stop treatment. Tracking complete blood counts and liver function are also important.   \"Pharmacology of cyclosporine and tacrolimus\".)\n【179】 Methotrexate — Methotrexate is a treatment option for the long-term control of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults and, less frequently, in adolescents and children .\n【180】 Administration – In adults and adolescents, methotrexate is usually administered in a single weekly dose of 7.5 to 25 mg. Supplementation with folic acid 1 mg is given six to seven times per week or 5 mg as a single weekly dose to reduce the risk of several common methotrexate toxicities . One international study of children using methotrexate for psoriasis found a higher risk of gastrointestinal toxicity with the weekly administration, despite approximately the same weekly total dose . Methotrexate has a slow onset of action, and benefit may not be noted in the first few months of treatment.\n【181】 The use and dosing of methotrexate in children with severe atopic dermatitis is discussed separately.   \"Management of severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in children\", section on 'Methotrexate'.)\n【182】 Efficacy and adverse effects – There is limited high-quality evidence for the use of methotrexate for the treatment of atopic dermatitis .\n【183】 In an open-label, follow-up study that included 35 of 43 adult participants of a randomized trial comparing methotrexate and azathioprine for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis , both agents were equally effective in reducing the SCORAD score at five years . The median drug survival was longer for methotrexate than for azathioprine (29 versus 12 months). Viral respiratory infections were the most common adverse events in both treatment groups. Serious adverse events requiring hospitalization occurred in 7 of 14 patients in the methotrexate group and 1 of 11 patients in the azathioprine group and included pneumonia, myocardial infarction, surgical wound abscess, bladder carcinoma, and exacerbation of atopic dermatitis.\n【184】 In a randomized trial comparing oral methotrexate 15 mg per week with cyclosporine 2.5 mg/kg per day in 97 adult patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, more patients in the cyclosporine group achieved the primary endpoint of a 50 percent reduction of SCORAD at eight weeks, compared with patients in the methotrexate group (42 versus 8 percent, respectively) .\n【185】 Common adverse effects of methotrexate include nausea and stomach upset, increased liver enzyme levels, headache, fatigue, and malaise. Periodic routine laboratory testing, including complete blood count and liver function, is required to monitor hematologic toxicity and hepatotoxicity.   \"Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate\".)\n【186】 Other agents — Other systemic immunosuppressive agents for the long-term treatment of atopic dermatitis include azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil. Their use in children and adults with severe atopic dermatitis is discussed separately.   \"Management of severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in children\" and  \"Evaluation and management of severe refractory atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults\".)\n【187】 PATIENTS WITH SEVERE REFRACTORY DISEASE — The management of severe refractory atopic dermatitis in children and adults is discussed separately.   \"Management of severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in children\" and  \"Evaluation and management of severe refractory atopic dermatitis (eczema) in adults\".)\n【188】 TREATING PREGNANT PATIENTS — The management of atopic dermatitis during pregnancy is discussed separately. A position article from the European Task Force on Atopic Dermatitis provided clear and pragmatic guidance for clinicians on management of atopic dermatitis in pregnancy . In most cases, pregnant patients can be treated with topical corticosteroids and broadband and narrowband UVB phototherapy. There are limited or no data on the safety of systemic immunosuppressants and biologics (eg, dupilumab) during pregnancy.  \"Recognition and management of allergic disease during pregnancy\", section on 'Atopic dermatitis' and  \"Dermatoses of pregnancy\", section on 'Atopic eruption of pregnancy'.)\n【189】 CONTROLLING PRURITUS — The management of atopic pruritus requires a multipronged approach that addresses the multiple factors involved in its pathogenesis . These include:\n【190】 Skin barrier disruption\n【191】 Aberrant type 2 immune response, with increased immunoglobulin E (IgE) production, eosinophilia, mast cell activation, and overexpression of T helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines\n【192】 Itch mediators, such as histamine, nerve growth factor, substance P, proteases, and cytokines/chemokines (eg, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, interleukin [IL] 2, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31)\n【193】 Hyperinnervation of skin and central sensitization of itch\n【194】 Nonpharmacologic interventions — Optimal skin hydration and moisturization and treatment with topical anti-inflammatory therapy are the cornerstones of atopic itch management. Tepid baths to hydrate and cool the skin followed by the application of emollients can relieve itching; some patients report better itch relief if the emollient is kept refrigerated.\n【195】 Topical treatments — Topical anti-inflammatory therapy with topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, or topical Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors is effective in controlling pruritus. In a meta-analysis of 22 randomized trials including 481 adult patients, pimecrolimus 1% cream or tacrolimus 0.03% to 0.1% ointment were more effective than vehicle in reducing pruritus (odds ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.61-0.68) .\n【196】 Phototherapy — In patients with diffuse pruritus that is not controlled with topical therapy alone, narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) or ultraviolet A1 (UVA1) phototherapy are therapeutic options . The mechanism of action involves a reduced production of histamine from mast cells and basophils. Moreover, as ultraviolet A (UVA) light penetrates deeper into the skin (compared with ultraviolet B [UVB]), it may also cause damage to Schwann and perineural cells, resulting in decreased sensitivity to pruritus.\n【197】 Oral antihistamines — Despite lack of evidence for their efficacy, oral H1 antihistamines are widely used as a therapeutic adjunct in patients with pruritus and atopic dermatitis . First-generation, sedating antihistamines (eg, diphenhydramine, hydroxyzine, and cyproheptadine) may be beneficial for patients with disturbed sleep due to itch, although optimal doses and length of treatment have not been determined .\n【198】 A 2019 systematic review of 25 randomized trials, most of which were of low methodologic quality, did not find evidence that antihistamines improve the symptoms of atopic dermatitis . In one of the included trials with 795 children aged one to two years, cetirizine 0.5 mg/kg per day for 18 months was no more effective than placebo in reducing the SCORAD score (-25 to -15 in the cetirizine group versus -25 to -16 in the placebo group) .\n【199】 In another randomized trial that included 400 adult patients with atopic dermatitis, fexofenadine 120 mg daily for one week reduced patient-assessed pruritus more than placebo, although the reduction was probably not clinically significant (mean change -0.75 in the fexofenadine group versus -0.5 in the placebo group on a pruritus scale of 0 to 8) .\n【200】 Cyclosporine — The efficacy of oral cyclosporine in rapidly improving pruritus and other symptoms of atopic dermatitis has been demonstrated in several randomized trials . However, recurrence is common upon discontinuation of treatment.\n【201】 Dupilumab — Based on studies in mouse models, it has been suggested that dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13, exerts a direct effect on sensory dorsal root ganglion activation by pruritogens (eg, IL-31) . In clinical trials, dupilumab has been shown to substantially improve atopic pruritus, even in patients with an unsatisfactory cutaneous response and in patients as young as six months .\n【202】 In a pooled analysis of data from two randomized trials , dupilumab was more effective than placebo in improving the secondary outcome of pruritus (numerical rating scale -35 versus -9 percent) in patients who were not clear/almost clear after 16 weeks of treatment with dupilumab .\n【203】 An analysis of data from 1505 adult and adolescent patients from four randomized trials showed a least squares mean percent change from baseline of daily Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale scores of approximately -48 to -57 percent in the dupilumab groups compared with -19 to -31 percent in the placebo groups . The improvement in the dupilumab groups occurred by day 2 in adults and day 5 in adolescents and was sustained through the end of treatment.\n【204】 Tralokinumab — Tralokinumab, an IL-13-inhibiting biologic, also provides itch relief and improvement in other signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis in adults and adolescents, especially in combination with topical corticosteroids.\n【205】 JAK inhibitors — In randomized trials, abrocitinib and upadacitinib provided rapid itch reduction . Their efficacy in reducing pruritus is presumably due to their ability to suppress multiple pruritogens, including IL-31 receptor signaling .\n【206】 MANAGEMENT OF INFECTION — Patients with atopic dermatitis are at increased risk for cutaneous bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Clinical signs of bacterial superinfection, most often from S. aureus, include weeping, pustules , worsening of dermatitis, or failure to respond to therapy. The presence of vesicles and punched-out erosions may be a sign of eczema herpeticum.\n【207】 Staphylococcus aureus — S. aureus is a frequent skin colonizer in patients with atopic dermatitis. A meta-analysis of 95 observational studies found that 70 percent of patients with atopic dermatitis carried S. aureus on lesional skin (95% CI 66-74) and 39 percent carried S. aureus on nonlesional skin (95% CI 31-47) . However, in patients without frank clinical infection, the role of staphylococcal colonization in driving the disease severity is still unclear, although multiple lines of evidence suggest a relationship between heavy colonization and atopic dermatitis severity . Studies in patients with the range of severities found a pooled colonization rate of 43 percent (95% CI 31-57) in patients with mild atopic dermatitis compared with 83 percent (95% CI 74-89) in those with severe atopic dermatitis .\n【208】 Clinically infected skin — Because of the universal skin colonization with S. aureus in patients with atopic dermatitis, routine skin swabs for bacteriologic culture are not recommended. However, skin and nasal swabs may be useful for assessing antimicrobial resistance or when there is clinical suspicion of unusual organisms.\n【209】 Clinically uninfected skin — Multiple observations indicate that in patients with atopic dermatitis without frank clinical infection, there is a relationship between the epidermal density of S. aureus and eczema severity or flare frequency . Since sodium hypochlorite 6% solution (liquid chlorine bleach) has activity against S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), diluted bleach baths 0.005% (obtained by adding 0.5 cup or 120 mL of 6% bleach in a full bathtub [40 gallons or 150 L] of lukewarm water; or one scant teaspoon of bleach in 1 gallon/4 liters of lukewarm water) have been widely suggested as an inexpensive adjunctive therapy for atopic dermatitis to reduce the cutaneous load of S. aureus and improve symptoms .\n【210】 Viral infections — Patients with atopic dermatitis and multifocal lesions that are infected with herpes simplex (called eczema herpeticum or Kaposi varicelliform eruption) should be treated immediately with oral antiviral therapy. Examination reveals skin with punched-out erosions, hemorrhagic crusts, and/or vesicles\n【211】 Fungal infections — Dermatophyte infections are more common in patients with atopic dermatitis and can be treated with standard regimens of topical or oral antifungals.   \"Dermatophyte (tinea) infections\".)\n【212】 ROLE OF ALLERGEN IMMUNOTHERAPY — Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is a treatment option for patients with proven sensitization to an allergen, such as house dust mites (eg, positive, allergen-specific in vitro testing or skin testing; exacerbation upon natural exposure to the allergen), and dermatitis that is not controlled with conventional therapies. AIT may be administered by either subcutaneous or sublingual routes and should be supervised by an allergy specialist.\n【213】 UNPROVEN THERAPIES\n【214】 Complementary and alternative therapies\n【215】 Probiotics — Probiotic therapy with Lactobacillus and other organisms has been studied for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in infants and children but has proven to be of limited benefit . In a 2009 meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials including 781 participants, probiotics were not more effective than placebo in reducing atopic dermatitis symptoms and sleep disturbance . In addition, the use of probiotics did not reduce the need for other treatments, such as topical corticosteroids. A subsequent meta-analysis of 25 randomized trials including 1600 participants found that probiotics were associated with a modest, clinically insignificant reduction of the baseline Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD) score (-4.5, 95% CI -6.8 to -2.2) .\n【216】 Dietary supplements — Dietary supplements, including vitamins, fish oil, and plant-derived essential fatty acids, do not appear to be beneficial for the treatment of atopic dermatitis . Evening primrose oil and borage oil, which are rich in the essential fatty acid gamma-linolenic acid, have been widely used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis as a complementary and alternative medicine remedy . However, studies of supplementation of gamma-linolenic acid for eczema have provided conflicting results . A meta-analysis of 19 randomized trials of evening primrose oil for the treatment of eczema in children and adults did not find a significant difference in global eczema symptoms (assessed by both the participants and clinicians) between the active treatment and placebo groups .\n【217】 Melatonin — Melatonin is a hormone produced in the pineal gland involved in the regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms   \"Pharmacotherapy for insomnia in adults\", section on 'Melatonin'). It has also been suggested that melatonin has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulating properties . In children and adults with atopic dermatitis, abnormal melatonin levels have been correlated with disease severity and degree of sleep disturbance .\n【218】 In a crossover trial, 48 children with atopic dermatitis involving >5 percent of the body surface area and a history of sleep disturbance interfering with daytime activities more than three days per week in the previous three months were treated with oral melatonin 3 mg per day or placebo at bedtime for four weeks, and then after a washout period of two weeks, were switched to the alternate treatment for an additional four weeks . Compared with placebo, melatonin was associated with a greater decrease from the baseline in the total SCORAD score (-9.9 versus -0.7 points) and a greater decrease of the sleep-onset latency time (-23 versus -1.2 minutes). No adverse effects were reported.\n【219】 Similar results were provided by another randomized trial that included 70 children aged 6 to 12 years who received oral melatonin 6 mg or placebo an hour before bedtime for six weeks, while continuing their usual treatment with topical corticosteroids and emollients . At the end of the study, children in the melatonin supplementation group compared with those in the placebo group had a greater improvement in the total SCORAD score from baseline (-6.6 versus -2.6 points) and in the total Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) score (-5.5 versus -2.7 points) but not in the pruritus score. A decrease in the total IgE level and an increase in the total sleep time per night were also noted in the melatonin group but not in the placebo group. No adverse effects associated with treatment were reported.\n【220】 Chinese herbal medicine — Chinese herbal medications for atopic dermatitis have been used for many years, but their efficacy and safety have not been adequately evaluated in clinical trials . A systematic review found three randomized trials and one open-label of a commercial preparation of 10 traditional Chinese herbs . Two trials showed a reduction in erythema and skin surface damage and improvement in sleep in the active treatment group but not in the placebo group. Another trial did not find any difference between the active treatment and placebo groups. All studies were small (less than 50 patients) and of poor methodologic quality.   \"Chinese herbal medicine for the treatment of allergic diseases\", section on 'Therapy for atopic dermatitis'.)\n【221】 Leukotriene receptor antagonists — Montelukast, an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist approved for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis in children and adults, has been evaluated for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in a few randomized trials with conflicting results.\n【222】 REFERRAL — Many patients with atopic dermatitis can initially be treated by a nonspecialist. We suggest that patients be referred to a specialist (eg, dermatologist, allergist) in the following circumstances:\n【223】 When the diagnosis is uncertain or contact allergy needs to be ruled out\n【224】 When disease has not responded to appropriate topical therapy\n【225】 If treatment of atopic dermatitis of the face or skin folds with high-potency topical corticosteroids is being contemplated\n【226】 If treatment with phototherapy or systemic agents is being considered\n【227】 If allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is being considered (refer to an allergist specifically)\n【228】 PREVENTION\n【229】 Skin barrier enhancement — Epidermal barrier dysfunction is recognized as a key factor in the initiation and progression of atopic dermatitis.   \"Atopic dermatitis (eczema): Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Epidermal barrier dysfunction'.)\n【230】 Skin moisturizing in infancy does not change the risk of developing atopic dermatitis by age 1 to 3 years (relative risk [RR] 1.03, 95% CI 0.81-1.31; moderate-certainty evidence) .\n【231】 Subgroup analysis showed that the type of emollient or the duration of emollient use, patient age, FLG mutation, chromosome 11 risk variant, or family history of atopy did not have an impact on the risk of developing atopic dermatitis.\n【232】 Skin care interventions using emollients may increase the risk of developing an IgE-mediated food allergy by one to three years when compared with standard care (RR 2.53, 95% CI 0.99-6.49; low-certainty evidence).\n【233】 The use of emollients may increase the risk of skin infections (risk ratio 1.33, 95% CI 1.01-1.75, moderate-certainty evidence).\n【234】 Probiotics and dietary supplements — Probiotic supplementation in pregnant mothers and infants at risk for atopic dermatitis may prevent the development of the disease in children younger than three years .\n【235】 Probiotics:\n【236】 A 2014 meta-analysis of 16 randomized trials including approximately 3500 participants found that probiotics given in the prenatal and postnatal period reduced the risk of atopic dermatitis in the first years of life in children at high risk of atopic dermatitis and in the general population (pooled odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.52-0.60) .\n【237】 However, two subsequent, randomized trials did not confirm this finding . In one study, a multispecies probiotic preparation or placebo was given to 454 unselected women at 36 weeks gestation and their infants to age six months . At two years, the cumulative frequency of eczema was similar in the probiotic and placebo groups (34 versus 32 percent; odds ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.7-1.6).\n【238】 In another randomized trial including 184 children at high risk for allergic disease, probiotic supplementation with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG during the first six months of life did not decrease the cumulative incidence of eczema at two years of age compared with placebo (29 versus 31 percent; hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.59-1.53) . The cumulative incidences of asthma at five years were also not significantly different in the two groups (10 versus 17 percent; hazard ratio 0.88, 95% CI 0.41-1.87).   \"Prebiotics and probiotics for prevention of allergic disease\".)\n【239】 Vitamin D:\n【240】 A few small, randomized trials evaluated the role of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention of winter-related exacerbation of atopic dermatitis with conflicting results . In the largest study, 107 children with a history of atopic dermatitis worsening during winter were treated with 1000 international units daily of vitamin D or placebo for one month . The primary outcome was a reduction in the clinician-measured Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI). At the end of the study, the mean decrease in the EASI score was 6.5 in the vitamin D group and 3.3 in the placebo group.\n【241】 A large, randomized trial that included 703 pregnant women found that maternal supplementation with vitamin D reduced the incidence of atopic dermatitis in the first year of life . In this study, infants born to mothers who received vitamin D 1000 international units per day during pregnancy had a lower risk of atopic dermatitis at age 12 months (odds ratio [OR] 0.55, 95% CI 0.32-0.97) compared with infants whose mothers had received placebo. However, this effect was not statistically significant at ages 24 or 48 months (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.47-1.23 and OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.37-1.52, respectively).\n【242】 Nutritional interventions — Previous international guidelines recommended the use of hydrolyzed formula for the prevention of allergic diseases in high-risk infants who cannot be exclusively breastfed . However, the results of a 2016 meta-analysis of 37 randomized trials evaluating the effect of hydrolyzed formula in infancy on the risk of childhood eczema, wheezing, allergic rhinitis, or food allergy do not support this recommendation . This meta-analysis did not find a significant difference between hydrolyzed formula and standard cow's milk formula in the risk of eczema at age 0 to 4 years (odds ratio [OR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.67-1.07) or 5 to 14 years (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.72-1.02).   \"Introducing formula to infants at risk for allergic disease\".)\n【243】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Atopic dermatitis\".)\n【244】 Basics topics   \"\n【245】 Beyond the Basics topics   \"\n【246】 Goals and principles of treatment – The goals of treatment of atopic dermatitis are to reduce symptoms (pruritus and dermatitis), prevent exacerbations, and minimize therapeutic risks. Management involves elimination of exacerbating factors, restoration of the skin barrier function and hydration of the skin, patient education, and pharmacologic treatment of skin inflammation (algorithm 1).  'Introduction' above and 'General approach' above.)\n【247】 Patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis:\n【248】 Topical therapies – Patients with mild to moderate symptoms\n【249】 However, for patients with atopic dermatitis in areas at high risk of atrophy (eg, face, skin folds), topical calcineurin inhibitors are an alternative to topical corticosteroids.  'Topical calcineurin inhibitors' above.)\n【250】 Second-line treatment options include topical crisaborole (adults and children) and topical ruxolitinib (adults and children older than 12 years).  'Crisaborole' above and 'Topical ruxolitinib' above.)\n【251】 Maintenance/proactive therapy – For patients with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis that responds to continuous topical therapy, we suggest maintenance/proactive therapy with topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors to prevent relapse (Grade 2B). Topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors are applied once daily for two to three days per week.  'Maintenance and prevention of relapses' above.)\n【252】 Patients with moderate to severe disease – For patients with moderate to severe disease who have an inadequate response to topical therapies, we suggest dupilumab or tralokinumab rather than other immunosuppressants or phototherapy (algorithm 1) (Grade 2C). Use of these agents is standard practice; however, abrocitinib, and upadacitinib are newly approved agents that may be alternative options for adult patients with inadequate response to dupilumab or tralokinumab.  'Biologic agents' above and 'Dupilumab' above.)\n【253】 For adults and adolescents with moderate to severe disease, narrowband ultraviolet B (NBUVB) phototherapy is an alternative first-line treatment if available and acceptable to the patient, but adherence can be challenging. Phototherapy is usually administered in the office two to three times per week.

Use caution in patients who are hypovolemic, hypotensive, or hemodynamically compromised; use caution in patients with coronary artery disease to avoid risk of myocardial ischemia. May prolong the QT interval and rarely torsades de pointes; use caution in patients at risk of QT prolongation. May produce cardiac steal (due to coronary vasodilation) and reflex tachycardia, but does not depress cardiac conduction nor does it sensitize the myocardium to catecholamine-induced arrhythmias like halothane (not available in the United States) (Golembiewski 2004).\n【57】 CNS depression: Advise patients to wait at least 24 hours after administration before engaging in activities which require mental alertness (operating machinery or driving).\n【58】 Decreased blood flow: May cause decrease in hepatic, renal, and splenic blood flow (Gelman 1984).\n【59】 Hepatic effects: Postoperative mild to severe hepatic dysfunction (including fatal hepatic necrosis and hepatic failure) and hepatitis with or without jaundice have been reported; may cause sensitivity hepatitis in patients who have been sensitized by previous exposure to halogenated anesthetics. Risk may be increased with repeated isoflurane exposure in a short time.\n【60】 Hyperkalemia: Use of inhaled anesthetics has been associated with rare cases of perioperative hyperkalemia that have resulted in cardiac arrhythmias (including fatalities) in pediatric patients; concomitant use of succinylcholine was associated with many of the reported cases, but not all. Risk of hyperkalemia is increased in pediatric patients with underlying neuromuscular disease (eg, Duchenne muscular dystrophy). Other abnormalities may include elevation in creatinine kinase (CK) and myoglobinuria. Monitor closely for hyperkalemic-associated arrhythmias; aggressively identify and treat.\n【61】 Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions (eg, anaphylaxis, cardiovascular collapse, difficulty breathing, hypotension, rash) have been reported.\n【62】 Increased intracranial pressure: Dilates the cerebral vasculature and may, in certain conditions, increase intracranial pressure.\n【63】 Malignant hyperthermia: May trigger malignant hyperthermia; some reported cases have been fatal. Risk may be increased with concomitant administration of succinylcholine and volatile anesthetic agents and patients with genetic factors or family history of malignant hyperthermia, including ryanodine receptor or dihydropyridine receptor inherited variants. Signs of malignant hyperthermia may include arrhythmias, cyanosis, hemodynamic instability, hypercapnia, hyperthermia, hypovolemia, hypoxia, muscle rigidity, tachycardia, and tachypnea; coagulopathies, renal failure, and skin mottling may also occur. If malignant hyperthermia is suspected, discontinue triggering agents and institute appropriate therapy (eg, dantrolene) and other supportive measures.\n【64】 Obstetrical anesthesia: Increased blood loss comparable with that seen with halothane has been reported during abortions.\n【65】 Respiratory depression: Causes dose-dependent respiratory depression and blunted ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia (Golembiewski 2004).\n【66】 Heart failure: In a scientific statement from the American Heart Association, isoflurane has been determined to be an agent that may exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction (magnitude: major) (AHA [Page 2016]).\n【67】 Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with history of hepatic impairment or taking medications known to cause hepatic impairment; evaluate need for repeated exposure in a short time as clinically indicated.\n【68】 Pediatric neurotoxicity: In pediatric and neonatal patients <3 years and patients in third trimester of pregnancy (ie, times of rapid brain growth and synaptogenesis), the repeated or lengthy exposure to sedatives or anesthetics during surgery/procedures may have detrimental effects on child or fetal brain development and may contribute to various cognitive and behavioral problems. Epidemiological studies in humans have reported various cognitive and behavioral problems including neurodevelopmental delay (and related diagnoses), learning disabilities, and ADHD. Human clinical data suggest that single, relatively short exposures are not likely to have similar negative effects. No specific anesthetic/sedative has been found to be safer. For elective procedures, risk vs benefits should be evaluated and discussed with parents/caregivers/patients; critical surgeries should not be delayed.\n【69】 Occupational caution: There is no specific work exposure limit established for isoflurane. However, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends no worker be exposed to >2 ppm (ceiling concentrations) over a period of 1 hour. Precautions (eg, adequate ventilation, scavenging-systems, minimizing leaks/spills) can help to lessen any potential risk.\n【70】 Desiccated absorbents: Reaction of isoflurane with desiccated CO2 absorbents produce carbon monoxide, which may result in elevated carboxyhemoglobin levels in some patients.\n【71】 Dosage Forms: US\n【72】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【73】 Solution, Inhalation:\n【74】 Forane: USP: >= 99.9 mL/100 mL (100 mL, 250 mL)\n【75】 Terrell: USP: >= 99.9 mL/100 mL (100 mL, 250 mL)\n【76】 Generic: USP: >= 99.9 mL/100 mL (100 mL, 250 mL)\n【77】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【78】 Yes\n【79】 Administration: Adult\n【80】 Via isoflurane-specific calibrated vaporizer or vaporizer with calculated flow required\n【81】 Administration: Pediatric\n【82】 Inhalation: Administer via isoflurane-specific calibrated vaporizer or vaporizer with calculated flow required\n【83】 Use: Labeled Indications\n【84】 Medication Safety Issues\n【85】 High alert medication:\n【86】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【87】 Drug Interactions\n【88】 Alcohol (Ethyl): CNS Depressants may enhance the CNS depressant effect of Alcohol (Ethyl).

Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【212】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【213】 Isoflurane crosses the placenta (Dwyer 1995; Satoh 1995).\n【214】 Based on animal data, repeated or prolonged use of general anesthetic and sedation medications that block N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) receptors and/or potentiate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity, may affect brain development. Evaluate benefits and potential risks of fetal exposure to isoflurane when duration of surgery is expected to be >3 hours (Olutoye 2018).\n【215】 Use of isoflurane in obstetric anesthesia has been described (Abboud 1989; ACOG 209 2019; Devroe 2015; Ghaly 1988; Liu 2013). Maternal exposure should be minimized due to dose dependent uterine relaxation and fetal depression (ACOG 209 2019; Devroe 2015).\n【216】 The ACOG recommends that pregnant women should not be denied medically necessary surgery, regardless of trimester. If the procedure is elective, it should be delayed until after delivery (ACOG 775 2019).\n【217】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【218】 It is not known if isoflurane is present in breast milk.\n【219】 The manufacturer recommends that caution be exercised when administering isoflurane to breastfeeding women.\n【220】 Based on pharmacokinetic properties, use of isoflurane in breastfeeding women may be considered acceptable (Lee 1993). The Academy of Breast Feeding Medicine recommends postponing elective surgery until milk supply and breastfeeding are established. Milk should be expressed ahead of surgery when possible. In general, when the child is healthy and full term, breastfeeding may resume, or milk may be expressed once the mother is awake and in recovery. For children who are at risk for apnea, hypotension, or hypotonia, milk may be saved for later use when the child is at lower risk (ABM [Reece-Stremtan 2017]).\n【221】 Monitoring Parameters\n【222】 BP, electrocardiogram, serum potassium, oxygen saturation, respiration, end-tidal CO2 and isoflurane concentrations should be monitored prior to and throughout anesthesia; consider additional cardiac monitoring in patients with coronary artery disease; QT interval in patients at risk for QTc prolongation.\n【223】 Mechanism of Action\n【224】 Isoflurane is a general anesthetic agent capable of producing profound respiratory depression. Inhaled anesthetics alter activity of neuronal ion channels, particularly the fast synaptic neurotransmitter receptors (nicotinic acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA], and glutamate receptors). May depress myocardial contractility, decrease blood pressure through a decrease in systemic vascular resistance, and decrease sympathetic nervous activity (Stachnik 2006).\n【225】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【226】 Metabolism: Minimally hepatic (<0.2%), predominantly CYP2E1 (Golembiewski 2004)\n【227】 Excretion: Exhaled gases\n【228】 Brand Names: International\n【229】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Isoflurane  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/isoflurane-drug-information?search=%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%8E%E9%81%97%E4%BC%A0%E7%97%85%E7%9B%B8%E5%85%B3%E7%9A%84%E5%BF%83%E5%BE%8B%E5%A4%B1%E5%B8%B8&source=search_result&selectedTitle=51%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 21:59:15"}

Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【74】 Estrogen Derivatives: May enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Raloxifene. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【75】 Fluoroestradiol F18: Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators may diminish the diagnostic effect of Fluoroestradiol F18.  Management: Image patients with fluoroestradiol F-18 prior to starting systemic endocrine therapies that block the estrogen receptor. Use of fluoroestradiol F-18 should not delay indicated treatment. Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【76】 Levothyroxine: Raloxifene may decrease the absorption of Levothyroxine.

Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【77】 Ospemifene: Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Ospemifene. Ospemifene may also enhance adverse/toxic effects of other Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators. Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators may diminish the therapeutic effect of Ospemifene. Ospemifene may also diminish the therapeutic effects of other Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators.  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【78】 Vitamin K Antagonists (eg, warfarin): Raloxifene may diminish the anticoagulant effect of Vitamin K Antagonists. Raloxifene may increase the serum concentration of Vitamin K Antagonists.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【79】 Reproductive Considerations\n【80】 Raloxifene is not indicated for use in females of reproductive potential.\n【81】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【82】 Raloxifene is contraindicated during pregnancy.\n【83】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【84】 It is not known if raloxifene is present in breast milk.\n【85】 Dietary Considerations\n【86】 Osteoporosis prevention or treatment: Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake; if dietary intake is inadequate, dietary supplementation is recommended. Females and males should consume:\n【87】 Calcium: 1,000 mg/day (males: 50 to 70 years of age) or 1,200 mg/day (females ≥51 years of age and males ≥71 years of age) (IOM 2011; NOF [Cosman 2014]).\n【88】 Vitamin D: 800 to 1,000 units daily (age ≥50 years) (NOF [Cosman 2014]). Recommended dietary allowance (RDA): 600 units daily (age ≤70 years) or 800 units daily (age ≥71 years) (IOM 2011).\n【89】 Monitoring Parameters\n【90】 Lipid profile (in females at risk for hypertriglyceridemia); mammogram and breast exam (prior to and regularly during treatment).\n【91】 Osteoporosis: Serial bone mineral density (BMD) should be evaluated at baseline and every 1 to 3 years (usually at ~2 years following initiation of therapy, then more or less frequently depending on patient-specific factors and stability of BMD) (AACE/ACE [Camacho 2020]; ES [Eastell 2019]; NOF [Cosman 2014]); annual measurements of height and weight, assessment of chronic back pain; serum calcium and 25(OH)D; may consider monitoring biochemical markers of bone turnover (eg, fasting serum CTX or urinary NTX) at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, to assess treatment response and adherence to therapy (ES [Eastell 2019]).\n【92】 Mechanism of Action\n【93】 Raloxifene is an estrogen agonist/antagonist (a selective estrogen receptor modulator [SERM]); selective binding activates estrogenic pathways in some tissues and antagonizes estrogenic pathways in other tissues. Raloxifene acts like an estrogen agonist in the bone to prevent bone loss and has estrogen antagonist activity to block some estrogen effects in the breast and uterine tissues. Raloxifene decreases bone resorption, increasing bone mineral density and decreasing fracture incidence.\n【94】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【95】 Absorption: Rapid; ~60%\n【96】 Distribution: 2,348 L/kg\n【97】 Protein binding: Highly protein bound (95% to albumin and α-glycoprotein); does not bind to sex-hormone-binding globulin\n【98】 Metabolism: Hepatic, extensive first-pass metabolism; metabolized to glucuronide conjugates\n【99】 Bioavailability: ~2%\n【100】 Half-life elimination: 27.7 hours (following a single dose); 32.5 hours (following multiple doses)\n【101】 Excretion: Feces (primarily); urine (<0.2% as unchanged drug; <6% as glucuronide conjugates)\n【102】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【103】 Altered kidney function: Raloxifene AUC was 122% higher in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment.\n【104】 Hepatic function impairment: Raloxifene apparent clearance was reduced 56% and plasma concentrations were increased 150% in patients with mild hepatic impairment.\n【105】 Brand Names: International\n【106】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Raloxifene  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/raloxifene-drug-information?search=%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E6%B0%A8%E5%9F%BA%E9%85%B8%E5%90%B8%E6%94%B6%E6%88%96%E8%BD%AC%E8%BF%90%E9%9A%9C%E7%A2%8D&source=search_result&selectedTitle=43%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:07:57"}

As time is limited during prenatal appointments and there are competing priorities, standardized printed or web-based questionnaires  may be useful to aid the clinician with assessment  'Assessment of environmental risk' below). We also advise clinicians to educate themselves about specific exposures that may be more prevalent in their geographic regions.\n【2】 Discuss impact of agent – For possible exposures, we discuss the potential impact of the agent on the patient, her fertility, the developing fetus, and the child. For patients with a specific known exposure, supporting written and web-based information can be helpful.  'Patient brochures about toxic exposures' below.)\n【3】 Discuss preventive measures – Opportunities to discuss environmental exposure arise frequently in clinical practice and often do require a lot of time to address. Examples include providing information (verbal, printed, online) when a woman expresses desire for pregnancy or when a patient presents with a specific history or question (ie, a woman asks about exposure to lead paint during house renovation).\n【4】 Provide additional resources – For patients and families with potential or confirmed exposures, we refer them to specialty providers for evaluation and/or management (ie, maternal-fetal medicine or occupational/environmental medicine specialists). In addition, we offer our patients counseling services to help them cope with the stress from the experience. Lastly, we provide them with websites that offer additional information relevant to their care.  'General information' below.)\n【5】 History – The history is the key first step: Are there any current or prior sources of lead exposure .\n【6】 Biological monitoring – For patients at risk of lead exposure, lead can be reliably measured through a biological monitoring test: the venous blood lead concentration, which is reported as microgram/dL. This measurement will reflect current exposures, as well as small amounts of lead stored in bone and then released over time into the blood. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concluded that current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms for routine screening for elevated BLLs in asymptomatic pregnant persons, but both the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommend targeted screening in pregnant and lactating women with risk factors for lead exposure, such as environmental, occupational, or pica .   \"Lead exposure, toxicity, and poisoning in adults\", section on 'When to measure blood lead levels'.)\n【7】 Some research studies can test for the quantity of lead in cortical (tibia) and trabecular bone (patella) through radiograph fluorescence, which is an indication of long-term lead exposure, but this is not a test that is clinically available.\n【8】 Environmental sampling – Lead can also be measured in air samples or wipe samples, more commonly done in work settings.\n【9】 Adverse pregnancy outcomes – Maternal lead exposure appears to increase the risk of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and small for gestational age (SGA) . One prospective study of 650 pregnant women reported the risk of spontaneous abortion increased with every 5 mcg/dL increase in BLL (range 5 to 20 mcg/dL) . Maternal BLL of ≥10 mcg/dL have been associated with reduced gestational length, increased risk for preterm birth, and SGA .\n【10】 Some cross-sectional studies have suggested that blood lead is associated with increased risk of hypertensive complications of pregnancy including preeclampsia. A meta-analysis of 11 studies including over 6000 women found that blood lead concentrations in pregnant women presented an important risk factor for preeclampsia, with an increase of 1 mcg/dL associated with a 1.6 percent increase in the likelihood of preeclampsia .   \"Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis\".)\n【11】 Effects on offspring – Studies have reported that young children with lead exposure have reduced neurobehavioral function and IQ, with no evidence of threshold effects . Impaired cognitive development has also been demonstrated in children even with low levels of prenatal lead exposure . Attempts to determine the impact of timing of lead exposure during pregnancy and subsequent cognitive impairment in offspring have reported inconsistent findings, including greatest correlation with first trimester exposure , greatest correlation with third trimester exposure , and no effect . While mechanism of action is not fully understood, alternations in DNA methylation have been reported in children following prenatal lead exposure . Additional information on childhood lead poisoning can be found in related content:\n【12】 Question – We ask about risk for lead exposure. Potential exposures include living in or renovating a home built before 1978, using imported pottery for cooking and eating, using Ayurvedic medication or supplements, using imported cosmetics (as those containing vermillion [sindoor]) or spices, or working in occupations with exposure. Additional discussion can be found in related content.   \"Childhood lead poisoning: Exposure and prevention\".)\n【13】 Test – Since many of the above risk factors may not be readily elicited, our approach is to have a very low threshold for ordering a venous blood level. The test is relatively inexpensive and could have a significant impact on the individual patient. Background blood levels for United States (2017 to 2018) adults age 20 years and older is, on average, <1 mcg/dL, and the 95th percentile is approximately 2.62 mcg/dL . Looking at background BLL in women of childbearing age, from 1976 to 2016, there has been a downward trend. From 2011 to 2016, 0.7 percent of women of childbearing age had BLL ≥0.5 mcg/dL (representing approximately 500,000 women), with higher BLL associated with various factors . The usual venous BLL is not a \"serum\" level, which is used more for research purposes. While independent reviews by the USPSTF and ACOG concluded that data were insufficient to recommend routine universal blood lead testing of all pregnant women, ACOG advises clinicians to consider venous BLL in women with risk factors, such as those who live in housing built before 1978, have an occupational exposure (or a partner with occupational exposure), or take alternative therapies that may contain lead  .\n【14】 Evaluation of children with suspected lead poisoning is presented separately.   \"Childhood lead poisoning: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis\".)\n【15】 Counsel – We provide information based on guidance from the CDC  .\n【16】 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Guidelines for the Identification and Management of lead exposure in pregnant and lactating women\n【17】 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): Breastfeeding, Environmental and Chemical Exposures, Lead\n【18】 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG): Lead Screening during pregnancy and lactation\n【19】 Organic mercury – The organic form, methyl mercury, is found in fish or contaminated foods, is one of the most commonly absorbed forms, and is typically of greatest concern and relevance among patients. Methyl mercury in these sources forms when inorganic mercury (as from industrial sources) enters the sea (also via air from coal-fired power plants), and sea microorganisms add a methyl group, which is ingested by fish eating smaller fish, so that it bioaccumulates among the larger predatory fish, such as tuna and swordfish, that have among the highest amounts of mercury. The mercury is present in the fish tissues and is not eliminated with cooking. The amount of methyl mercury in fish and seafood, therefore, varies, and concentrations for different fish are listed in resources such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) web site. It is absorbed easily by ingestion. Per the US Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals, blood methyl mercury levels have been gradually decreasing since 2011 . The reported geometric means for total blood mercury for females were 0.489 (2011 to 2012), 0.422 (2013 to 2014), and 0.399 (2015 to 2016).\n【20】 Another form of organic mercury is ethyl mercury (thimerosal), which has been used as a preservative for decades in multidose vials of medicines and vaccines . Ethyl mercury is eliminated more quickly from the body than methyl mercury. Numerous studies have not shown any significant adverse effects in children (including no evidence of autism) or adults related to the small quantity added to vaccines. Most childhood vaccines never contained thimerosal, and in 2001, thimerosal was removed from vaccines in the United States . Influenza vaccine is available in both thimerosal-containing (for multidose vials) and thimerosal-free versions , and there is a chart that lists all ingredients in vaccines . The CDC provides a useful resource for patients: Understanding Thimerosal, Mercury, and Vaccine Safety .\n【21】 Elemental mercury – Elemental mercury refers to the liquid metallic (elemental) mercury that is used in dental amalgams, fluorescent lights, and some artisanal gold mining processes. Elemental mercury vaporizes at room temperature and is mainly absorbed through vapor inhalation and not by oral ingestion of the liquid. For women with mercury-containing dental amalgams, exposure could occur during chewing or teeth grinding when the element is vaporized and then inhaled. One study of pregnant women with amalgams and restorations, overall, did not report an association with negative birth outcomes . Overall, the exposure is very small. Women should not have fillings removed just to reduce mercury exposure.\n【22】 Of greater concern is the potential high exposure to elemental mercury in pregnant women around or working in artisanal gold mining . This type of small-scale mining, usually performed by poorly educated individuals in low-resource settings, is carried out in 70 countries by approximately 10 to 15 million miners, including approximately 4 to 5 million women and children . The work involves crushing possible gold-containing rocks or river sediment and adding elemental mercury (usually in large quantities) to form a gold-mercury \"amalgam.\" This mixture is then heated to vaporize the mercury, leading to air, soil, and water contaminated with mercury. Women make up to 10 to 50 percent of the small-scale mining population directly but could also be contaminated indirectly, and such a level of mercury exposure could pose a threat to a developing fetus.\n【23】 Inorganic salts – Inorganic salts are formed when mercury combines with other elements such as sulfur or oxygen. Exposures can occur through industrial work. In addition, these compounds are sometimes added to cosmetic creams for skin lightening and can be absorbed through the skin .\n【24】 History – In the clinical setting, we begin with questions primarily concerning fish/seafood intake, particularly the type of fish. We also ask about occupation (exposure to any mercury type sources), use of elemental mercury in any cultural practices, use of skin lightening cosmetic creams , and recent dental work to remove mercury/silver amalgams. Clinicians who see patients from a community involved in gold mining are advised to ask about mercury exposure related to mining practices.\n【25】 Biological monitoring – For patients with possible mercury exposure based on history, blood mercury level is the most common test and reflects the concentration of total mercury (microgram/L). The test does not distinguish among the different forms of mercury. The half-life of mercury, in general, is approximately one to two months. Methyl mercury is excreted predominately through the gastrointestinal tract, and some is metabolized to the inorganic form that may then be excreted in the urine. Elemental and inorganic mercury have a much greater excretion in the urine. For screening, we order blood and spot urine mercury levels along with a urine creatinine (to correct for concentration on a spot sample). Urine mercury is reported both as mcg/L, as well as microgram per gram of creatinine. Finding the majority of mercury in the blood sample with little to none in the urine is suggestive of methyl mercury. Mercury can also be measured in hair, but a significant quantity may be required, and the result may be no more useful than a blood level given the half-life of one to two months.\n【26】 Inquire about possible sources of mercury exposure; the most common source is consumption of large predator-type fish (eg, shark, swordfish, tilefish, king mackerel).\n【27】 Counsel patients on the benefits and risks of fish consumption during pregnancy, including the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids . We discuss the ACOG Practice Advisory that suggests women eat two to three servings a week (8 to 12 ounces total) of fish in the best category, one serving a week (no more than 6 ounces) of fish in the good category, and avoid fish with the highest mercury levels . The FDA provides guidance with a chart that can be printed in English or Spanish. Patients with internet access can also check a list of mercury levels in commercial fish and shellfish and choose lower-mercury species.   \"Fish consumption and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in pregnancy\".)\n【28】 Monitor when clinically indicated. In situations in which a high level of mercury from any source is suspected, the clinician may choose to do a biological monitoring test. We advise a blood mercury, accompanied by a urine spot test for mercury, and urine creatinine (to adjust for concentration). An elevated blood mercury with much less in the urine is suggestive of methyl mercury. Interpretation and counseling regarding a test result are critical. Many fish eaters will have blood mercury levels greater than 5.8 mcg/L. The key actions are to identify the source and to decrease or eliminate the exposure. If fish is the likely source, the patient can switch to the very low mercury seafood. If the patient is preconception, advice could be given to wait until blood mercury levels decline, if elevated. As with lead, use of chelators during pregnancy is not advised unless there is evidence of very high mercury. Chelating agents also do not work well for methyl mercury and are more effective for inorganic mercury. In these situations, we advise consultation with an expert specialist.   \"Mercury toxicity\", section on 'Treatment'.)\n【29】 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Advice about Eating Fish (For persons who are or might become pregnant, breastfeeding mothers, and young children).\n【30】 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR): Mercury and your health.\n【31】 History – We inquire about the patient's occupation, source of drinking water, diet, and use of any supplements. Drinking water, particularly from well water, is a common environmental source of arsenic.\n【32】 Biological monitoring – Arsenic can be measured in the urine, usually as \"total arsenic,\" but it is important to speciate (fractionate) the sample to measure inorganic arsenic since there are other forms of arsenic (arsenobetaine, arsenosugars) from fish, shellfish, and other foods that are of minimal to no toxicity but add to the total arsenic measured and give a false impression of the presence of toxic exposure . Urine is generally the preferred biomarker for recent arsenic exposure because arsenic is rapidly excreted into urine and can be speciated. Although it can also be measured in blood, it is cleared quickly from this reservoir.\n【33】 For screening, a spot urine sample is obtained for both urine arsenic and urine creatinine. Urine creatinine is used to adjust for urine concentration. The initial arsenic result is reported as micrograms of arsenic per liter. The clinician then adjusts for urine concentration to determine the micrograms of arsenic per gram of creatinine (divide the microgram arsenic per liter by gram of creatinine per liter, and one arrives at microgram of arsenic per gram of creatinine). Some labs will do this if an arsenic profile is ordered.\n【34】 After absorption, inorganic arsenic is distributed through the body, metabolized in the liver, and accumulated in the skin, hair, and nails. Advantages of using hair for testing include that it binds the inorganic (toxic) forms, but not the seafood-derived, less toxic, organic forms, and it can reflect exposures from the past (pending the length of the hair). Disadvantages of using hair for arsenic monitoring include that it will also bind external arsenic sources, such as from air (smelter) or from bathing with arsenic-contaminated water, and thus may not reflect the true internal dose. Hair samples tend to be more used in the research setting.\n【35】 Environmental assessment – Arsenic can be measured in well water and is usually assumed to be in inorganic form. Both the EPA and the World Health Organization currently have a guideline of 10 mcg/L for drinking water in order to decrease risks for future arsenic-related cancers.\n【36】 Ask about source of drinking water and, if from well water, if it has been tested for arsenic. If not, a wise approach may be to drink and cook with other water (bottled) until the level of arsenic is known. If elevated, the patient is advised to stop drinking that water and using it for cooking.\n【37】 Ask about rice intake or concerns about rice. For most people who eat a variety of grains, exposure to inorganic arsenic will not be significant. If there are questions, we refer to available resources.  'Useful resources' below.)\n【38】 In most cases, biological monitoring tests for arsenic are not necessary. If there is a concern about continued exposure, such as from drinking water or from work exposures, then we order a urine arsenic (a spot sample is usually adequate for adults) that is speciated in order to know the amount of inorganic arsenic. In addition, we check a urine creatinine to correct for concentration, reported as micrograms of arsenic per gram of creatinine (ideally, micrograms of inorganic arsenic per gram of creatinine).\n【39】 For situations of chronic inorganic arsenic exposure, the treatment is to stop the exposure. Arsenic is quickly cleared from the blood. However, chronic arsenic exposure is associated with cancer and other adverse health outcomes.   \"Arsenic exposure and poisoning\", section on 'Clinical toxicity and presentation'.)\n【40】 World Health Organization (WHO): Fact Sheet on Arsenic (2018)\n【41】 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Testing and analysis of arsenic in rice and rice products\n【42】 FDA: Seven things pregnant women and parents need to know about arsenic in rice and rice cereal\n【43】 Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units (PEHSU): Fact sheet – Information on Arsenic in Food (2012)\n【44】 Animal data – The potential that phthalates could adversely impact reproductive health was first recognized from experimental animal studies. Among rodents, in utero phthalate exposure was found to be embryo- and fetotoxic, with fewer litters achieved, fewer live pups per litter, and reduced pup weight . Prenatal exposure among rats also has been linked with a constellation of teratogenic effects demonstrable in male rats known as the \"phthalate syndrome\" . This is characterized by a reduced anogenital distance, hypospadias, testicular malformations, and reduced semen quality bearing a striking resemblance to testicular dysgenesis among humans. It is important to emphasize that animal studies demonstrating the reproductive toxicity of phthalates used much higher phthalate concentrations than the range of typical human exposure. Furthermore, there is strong evidence of species-specific toxicity, with rats being particularly vulnerable to phthalate exposure, underscoring the need for human-specific data.\n【45】 Human data – In contrast to a fairly extensive animal literature, only limited data are available to inform our understanding about the potential reproductive toxicity of phthalates among humans, although some studies suggest negative impacts on both fertility and pregnancy outcomes. Reduced anogenital distance among male infants, which is a marker of reduced androgen exposure during fetal life and associated with male subfertility in later life, has been demonstrated in association with prenatal phthalate exposure in some but not all studies . Similarly, an increased risk for male newborn genital anomalies (hydrocele, hypospadias, and undescended testes) has been observed in some, but not all, studies .\n【46】 In 2006, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) convened a meeting of experts to address concerns that the negative health effects identified in experimental in vitro and animal studies occurred at \"low-dose\" exposure levels (ie, within the range of typical human exposure). The 2007 NIH/EPA consensus panel statement concluded that, even in the absence of extensive human data, it was prudent to reduce exposure in the interim while human research continued to advance (the precautionary principle) . They also emphasized that the consequences of exposure may not occur until much later in life (developmental origins of adult health and disease [DOHaD] hypothesis).\n【47】 A separate expert panel convened in 2007 by the National Toxicology Program, part of the United States National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, reached the following conclusions about current levels of human exposure among fetuses, infants, and children :\n【48】 A 2016 review of literature published between 2007 and 2016 concluded that BPA was associated with negative effects upon female fertility . In one included study, among a cohort of couples undergoing infertility treatment, both urinary and serum BPA concentration was inversely correlated with both the number of oocytes retrieved and the peak estradiol during in vitro fertilization cycles .\n【49】 In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a statement that authorized levels of BPA use were safe for consumers based on data from a pre-peer review draft report of a two-year study involving rats performed by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) . Members of the Endocrine Society, including over 18,000 researchers and clinicians, released a counter-statement that the FDA's conclusions were \"premature and incomplete,\" in part because the conclusion included only the one guideline study and excluded other published grantee studies .\n【50】 Avoid plastic polycarbonate plastic (recycle number 7 and some number 3 plastics) .\n【51】 Do not microwave or otherwise heat food and drinks in polycarbonate plastic.\n【52】 Hand wash polycarbonate containers rather than putting them in the dishwasher with harsh detergents at high temperatures.\n【53】 Avoid canned foods and .\n【54】 Consider alternatives to plastic bags for storage of breast milk, such as small glass bottles or freezing the breast milk in silicone ice cube trays and then storing as cubes that can be defrosted in glass (instead of plastic).\n【55】 Other phenols – Other chemicals in the phenol class include BPA substitutes, triclosan (used for its antibacterial properties in personal care and cleaning products), and parabens (used as preservatives in cosmetics and creams). Even less is known about the potential impact of these agents on human reproductive health. Given the absence of data to support safety or harm of these chemicals during conception and pregnancy, we advise pregnant women to avoid exposure to these products as much as reasonably possible.\n【56】 Useful resources – Additional education and training for clinicians is available through the PEHSU webinar on Phthalates and Phenols. A PEHSU factsheet on Phthalates and Bisphenol A for Healthcare Providers can be found here. A FAQ document have been prepared for the public by the National Toxicology Program out of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.\n【57】 Reproductive health – Although the available data are less consistent than that for neurotoxic effects, insecticides also appear to adversely impact pregnancy outcomes (birth weight, gestational age at delivery) . A study of 314 mother-newborn pairs reported an inverse association between chlorpyrifos levels and both birth weight and newborn length . The decrease in birth weight (-186 grams per log increase in chlorpyrifos levels) was similar in magnitude to that attributed to maternal smoking. Other studies have evaluated specific or nonspecific organophosphorus pesticide (OP) metabolites in maternal urine as an integrating dosimeter of exposure to OP insecticides. Additional studies that evaluated the relationship between OPs and gestational age at birth also reported significant negative associations, which suggests the outcome of preterm birth merits additional research . Pyrethroids have also been associated in cohort studies with negative impact on birth outcomes, such as preterm birth or low birth weight .\n【58】 In addition to an impact on female reproduction, pesticide exposure has been linked with poor semen quality and reduced fertility among males following both occupational and lower-level environmental exposure .\n【59】 Neurotoxicity – There is animal and epidemiologic evidence that non-DDT insecticides also adversely impact neurodevelopment . This is not surprising given that the chemicals were initially designed as nerve agents. Evidence for neurotoxicity is strongest for organophosphate pesticides with demonstrable deficits in cognition, memory, behavior, and motor reflexes; the greatest effects appear to occur following prenatal exposure (compared with postnatal)  and is not limited to women exposed occupationally. Yet, experimental and preliminary epidemiologic studies suggest prenatal exposure to pyrethroid insecticides also adversely affects learning and behavior in offspring .\n【60】 Avoid application of residential pesticides both indoors and outdoors, and stay out of areas that have been recently treated.\n【61】 Choose baits and traps over sprays, dusts, and bombs to control residential pests.\n【62】 Seal cracks and holes in homes to reduce influx of insects.\n【63】 Remove shoes at the door.\n【64】 Avoid chemical tick and flea collars on pets.\n【65】 Wash fruits and vegetables (although this removes only surface pesticide residues).\n【66】 Consider purchase of organic fruits and vegetables, with a focus on the dirty dozen (reported by the Environmental Working Group each year). We recognize this option may be unavailable to all patients given potentially prohibitive pricing of such products.\n【67】 Insect repellants, such as DEET, do not appear to pose a significant concern to human health, including during pregnancy, when used as directed, although data remain limited .\n【68】 Testing – The 2022 the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) consensus study on PFAS suggests a role for possible PFAS blood testing in certain situations for those patients \"who are likely to have a history of elevated exposure.\" This includes those with occupational exposure (eg, firefighters), those who live in communities where PFAS contamination has been documented (eg, drinking water exceeding regulatory limits), or those who live near PFAS-contaminated facilities. Although some of these chemicals can be measured in the blood and compared with population levels, there are currently only limited human correlations of the measured level and risk of adverse outcomes. Therefore, we have been hesitant to advise routine blood testing since it is difficult to interpret, or offer advice, other than to stop the exposure.\n【69】 Test interpretation and treatment – The above recommendations remain challenging to interpret as there are different definitions of what constitutes elevated exposure or PFAS contamination given variations in state and national guidelines . In addition, there is no way (as yet) to remove or enhance excretion of the PFAS chemicals from the body.\n【70】 Role in establishing exposure – One justification for getting some blood testing, particularly for the specific PFAS found in elevated levels in the drinking water, would be to have a baseline measurement that would be available if at some later time new information arises that would be useful.\n【71】 Decreased antibody response (adults and children)\n【72】 Dyslipidemia (adults and children)\n【73】 Decreased infant and fetal growth\n【74】 Increased risk of kidney cancer (adults)\n【75】 They also found suggestive evidence of an association with:\n【76】 Increased risk of breast cancer (adults)\n【77】 Liver enzyme alterations (adults and children)\n【78】 Increased risk of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia\n【79】 Increased risk of testicular cancer (adults)\n【80】 Thyroid disease and dysfunction (adults)\n【81】 Increased risk of ulcerative colitis (adults)\n【82】 For those found to have elevated levels, counsel about currently known associations to increased risks and perform relevant screening for related potential health issues.\n【83】 The most important guidance is to stop or reduce exposure.\n【84】 For occupational exposures, identify and reduce potential sources of exposure, which may also include inhalation.\n【85】 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) website on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) and your health\n【86】 ASTDR: PFAS – An Overview of the Science and Guidance for Clinicians on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) (revised December 6, 2019)\n【87】 United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): Research on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)\n【88】 Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units (PEHSU): Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) resources\n【89】 The Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment at the University of California San Francisco provides free online patient brochures, including:\n【90】 The ATSDR provides Patient Education and Care Instruction Sheets that address exposure to arsenic, asbestos, beryllium, carbon tetrachloride toxicity, nitrate/nitrite, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and radon.\n【91】 The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Frequently Asked Questions on Toxic Chemicals: Steps to Stay Safer Before and During Pregnancy.\n【92】 Environmental exposures and reproduction\n【93】 Environment and general health\n【94】 Counseling challenges and data limitations – Challenges in counseling women about the reproductive effects of chemical agents include the vast number of exposures and exposure combinations, limited applicability of animal data to humans, the inability to assume causation from association, the variable impact of agent dose and timing on reproductive and developmental outcomes, and the numerous potentially confounding variables (eg, maternal substance use, socioeconomic level, nutrition).

If signs and symptoms of a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction or anaphylaxis occur, immediately discontinue administration and initiate appropriate medications and/or supportive care. Monitor patients after administration for ≥1 hour. Additionally, tixagevimab and cilgavimab contain polysorbate 80, an ingredient in some COVID-19 vaccines; polysorbate 80 is also structurally similar to polyethylene glycol, an ingredient in some other COVID-19 vaccines. Consider consultation with an allergist/immunologist prior to administering tixagevimab and cilgavimab to individuals who have experienced a severe hypersensitivity reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to a COVID-19 vaccine (FDA 2022).

Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【56】 Rozanolixizumab: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Fc Receptor-Binding Agents. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【57】 Reproductive Considerations\n【58】 The phase 3 trials (NCT04625725 and NCT04625972) required patients who could become pregnant to use effective contraception and the use of condoms by males.\n【59】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【60】 Nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted (FDA 2022).\n【61】 Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are both humanized monoclonal antibodies (IgG1). Human IgG crosses the placenta. Exposure is dependent upon the IgG subclass, maternal serum concentrations, placental integrity, newborn birth weight, and GA, generally increasing as pregnancy progresses. The lowest exposure would be expected during the period of organogenesis and the highest during the third trimester (Clements 2020; Palmeira 2012; Pentsuk 2009).\n【62】 The risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection is increased in symptomatic pregnant patients compared to nonpregnant patients. Pregnant and recently pregnant patients with moderate or severe infection are at increased risk of complications such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage, or other infections compared to pregnant patients without COVID-19. Symptomatic pregnant patients may require ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or ventilatory support (ECMO) compared to symptomatic nonpregnant patients. Other adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm birth and stillbirth. The risk of coagulopathy, cesarean delivery, and maternal death may be increased; neonates have an increased risk for NICU admission. Maternal age and comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, lung disease, and obesity may also increase the risk of severe illness in pregnant and recently pregnant patients (ACOG 2023; NIH 2022).\n【63】 In general, the therapeutic management of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy is the same as in nonpregnant patients. However, because data for most therapeutic agents in pregnant patients are limited, treatment options should be evaluated as part of a shared decision-making process (NIH 2022). Pregnant patients were excluded from the phase 3 trials (NCT04625725 and NCT04625972). Pregnancy itself is not one of the medical conditions listed in the emergency use authorization (EUA) eligibility criteria for use. According to the EUA, dose adjustments are not recommended for patients who are pregnant (FDA 2022). Information related to the treatment of COVID-19 during pregnancy continues to emerge; refer to current guidelines for the treatment of pregnant patients.\n【64】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【65】 It is not known if tixagevimab or cilgavimab are present in breast milk.\n【66】 Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are both humanized monoclonal antibodies (IgG1). Human IgG is present in breast milk; concentrations are dependent upon IgG subclass and postpartum age (Anderson 2021).\n【67】 Breastfeeding patients were excluded from the phase 3 trials (NCT04625725 and NCT04625972). According to the emergency use authorization (EUA), the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and the benefits of treatment to the mother. According to the EUA, dose adjustments are not recommended for lactating patients (FDA 2022).\n【68】 Monitoring Parameters\n【69】 Monitor for ≥1 hour after injections for hypersensitivity reactions (FDA 2022).\n【70】 Mechanism of Action\n【71】 Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are recombinant human IgG1κ monoclonal antibodies that bind to nonoverlapping epitopes of the spike protein receptor–binding domain of SARS-CoV-2, blocking attachment to the human ACE2 receptor. Tixagevimab and cilgavimab have amino acid substitutions to extend half-life, reduce antibody effector function, and minimize the potential risk of antibody-dependent disease enhancement (FDA 2022).\n【72】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【73】 Distribution: Vd: Tixagevimab: 7.7 ± 1.97 L; Cilgavimab: 8.7 ± 2.73 L (FDA 2022).\n【74】 Bioavailability: Tixagevimab: 68.5%; Cilgavimab: 65.8% (FDA 2022).\n【75】 Half-life elimination: Tixagevimab: 87.9 ± 13.9 days; Cilgavimab: 82.9 ± 12.3 days (FDA 2022).\n【76】 Time to peak: Tixagevimab: 14.9 days (range: 1.1 to 86 days); Cilgavimab: 15 days (range: 1.1 to 85 days) (FDA 2022).\n【77】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【78】 Pediatric: Clinical trials have not been performed; serum exposures in patients ≥12 years of age and weighing ≥40 kg are expected to be similar to those observed in adults (FDA 2022).\n", "title": "Tixagevimab and cilgavimab (Canada  Authorized; United States  Authorization withdrawn)  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/tixagevimab-and-cilgavimab-canada-authorized-united-states-authorization-withdrawn-drug-information?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%A7%E8%A4%A5%E6%9C%9F%E5%B9%B6%E5%8F%91%E7%97%87&source=search_result&selectedTitle=128%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:12:17"}

R. prowazekii is one of two members of the typhus group of Rickettsia known to cause human illness; the other member, Rickettsia typhi, causes murine typhus. Scrub typhus is caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. Like all rickettsiae, R. prowazekii cannot be grown on cell-free media, and specialized laboratory facilities are required to recover the organism from clinical specimens.\n【1】 The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of epidemic typhus will be discussed here. Topic reviews that discuss murine typhus and scrub typhus are found elsewhere.   \"Scrub typhus\" and  \"Murine typhus\".)\n【2】 BACKGROUND — The first description of epidemic typhus was thought to be made in 1546 by an Italian physician, Girolamo Fracastoro, who separated epidemic typhus from other typhus-like infections. It remains controversial as to whether typhus was imported into Europe from the New World or vice versa .\n【3】 Throughout the Middle Ages and into the early part of the 20th century, periodic epidemics of R. prowazekii infection killed millions of people. As an example, during the eight-year period from 1917 to 1925, over 25 million cases of epidemic typhus occurred in Russia, causing an estimated three million deaths . It has been estimated that epidemic typhus has caused more deaths than all the wars in history .\n【4】 Epidemic typhus is now a rare disease, but subsequent developments illustrate that an understanding of its epidemiology, clinical features, and treatment is still important to clinicians:\n【5】 The outbreaks of typhus in Africa illustrate that the words of Hans Zinsser are still applicable today: \"Typhus is not dead. It will live on for centuries and it will continue to break into the open whenever human stupidity and brutality give it a chance as most likely they occasionally will\" .\n【6】 EPIDEMIOLOGY — Epidemic typhus is a vector-borne disease with a complex epidemiology. The principal vectors are Pediculosis humanus (the body louse) and P. humanus capitis (the head louse) . The human louse was thought to be the sole vector of R. prowazekii and humans were thought to be the sole reservoir of infection until a report in 1975 demonstrated that R. prowazekii infection occurred in flying squirrels in the southeastern United States .\n【7】 Subsequent studies revealed that both the squirrel flea (Orchospea howardii) and the squirrel louse (Neohaemotophinus sciuropteri) are vectors for the transmission of R. prowazekii among flying squirrels. Although N. sciuropteri is host-specific and does not feed on humans, O. howardii will bite humans and transmit R. prowazekii if its principal host, the flying squirrel, is unavailable . In one study, flying squirrels inoculated with R. prowazekii developed a rickettsemia that lasted for two to three weeks. Lice, fleas, and mites feeding on these experimentally-infected squirrels could be infected with R. prowazekii .\n【8】 A limited number of papers about the epidemiology of R. prowazekii infection have been published in recent decades. However, the available data suggest that reporting and detection biases probably exist. Epidemic typhus is likely to be misdiagnosed or completely undiagnosed in areas of the world where poverty, famine, war, and disease occur simultaneously. As an example, seroprevalence studies of patients from North Africa and in homeless people from Marseilles, France suggest that R. prowazekii infection may be occurring far more often than is recognized . The incidence of R. prowazekii infection in homeless populations in the United States is unknown. In one study, 2 of 176 homeless people from Houston had serologic evidence of infection with R. prowazekii . In another prospective serological study of febrile patients with exanthems at a single hospital in Algeria, 1 of 14 proven cases of rickettsial infection identified over a six-year time period was due to R. prowazekii. This illustrates that multiple rickettsial pathogens may coexist with R. prowazekii in the same geographic area .\n【9】 Mechanisms of transmission — The body louse typically spends its life on the skin or clothes of humans. Its prevalence is increased by cold weather, humidity, and poor hygiene . Eggs are laid on clothes and hatch in about eight days. After hatching, larvae molt three times before they become adults.\n【10】 Lice require a blood meal during each of these three stages. During a blood meal, the louse defecates highly infective feces at the site of its feeding. Rickettsiae present in louse feces may then be introduced into abraded or injured skin or mucous membranes by either scratching or hand contamination, since skin irritation commonly occurs at the site of a louse bite. Lice feces may remain infectious for as long as 100 days; as a result, human to human transmission can occur from sharing clothes or transfer of infective lice feces from one human to another.\n【11】 The mechanisms of louse infection following feeding on an infected host were explored in an experimental model of human body louse infection with R. prowazekii . The following findings were noted:\n【12】 Lice are capable of serially feeding on different humans, but transfer of infected lice directly from one human to another is thought to be uncommon. One possible reason for this is the rapid death of lice following rickettsial infection, as summarized above . However, indirect transmission via infected lice in contaminated clothing or from crowded environmental conditions is known to occur . In experimental conditions, R. prowazekii can also be transmitted via aerosols, and because R. prowazekii can be infectious for prolonged periods (eg, 100 days in louse feces), R. prowazekii remains on the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) list of potential bioweapons .\n【13】 Transmission of the sylvatic form of epidemic typhus to humans typically occurs when humans have direct contact with infected squirrels or when squirrels that are nesting in the attics or walls of homes are removed or killed and the lice inhabiting their nest are forced to seek alternate hosts. However, transmission of sylvatic typhus may occur in individuals who have no recollection or evidence of recent louse bites .\n【14】 Geographic distribution — Only a few foci of epidemic typhus still exist in the world today. In recent decades, cases of epidemic typhus have been reported in Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia and in the rural highlands of South America, Asia, and Algeria .\n【15】 Except for a single case reported from California, almost all cases of epidemic typhus in the United States until 2001 occurred east of the Mississippi River within the range of the eastern flying squirrel (Glaucomys volans). However, in 2001, a patient from New Mexico, who presented with fever and signs and symptoms of meningitis without skin rash, was found to have acute infection with R. prowazekii using PCR amplification of the 17-kDA antigen gene and DNA sequencing of the amplified product . The source of his infection could not be determined. A cluster of four cases of epidemic typhus subsequently occurred between 2004 and 2006 among staff and visitors to a wilderness camp in Pennsylvania; an investigation concluded that the source of infection was flying squirrels nesting in the walls of a cabin adjacent to a specific bunk . Of the 14 flying squirrels trapped in woodlands near the cabin, 71 percent were infected with R. prowazekii. Similar findings were reported in 2009, when an investigation of two cases of epidemic typhus in the same household in New York state found 11 flying squirrels trapped in the attic of this house, and all were seropositive to R. prowazekii antigens .\n【16】 Sylvatic epidemic typhus associated with flying squirrels remains an uncommon disease in the United States. The CDC documented only 47 cases in the US from 1976 to 2010 . However, it is likely that other cases were never recognized or serologically confirmed.\n【17】 Coinfection — Coinfection with R. prowazekii and another louse-born pathogen, B. quintana, has been reported. The development of \"paleomicrobiologic techniques\" (ie, using molecular diagnostic methods to examine the dental pulp of long-buried skeletons) has revealed evidence that soldiers dying during Napoleonic military campaigns during the early 19th century had evidence of simultaneous infection with both pathogens. Similar findings of coinfection were documented in outbreaks in Burundi during a civil war in 1993, and in Rwanda in 2012 . A more detailed discussion of B. quintana is found elsewhere.   \"Bartonella quintana infections: Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment\".)\n【18】 PATHOGENESIS — After transcutaneous entry of infective louse tissues or feces, R. prowazekii spreads throughout the body via the blood stream or lymphatics. Once inside the human host, typhus rickettsiae, like R. rickettsii, enter endothelial cells and proliferate by binary fission.   \"Biology of Rickettsia rickettsii infection\".)\n【19】 The precise mechanism by which R. prowazekii produces cellular injury is still uncertain, but experimental studies suggest that a complex and multifactorial sequence of events results in endothelial injury via both cellular swelling and necrosis. Secondary immune and phagocytic responses to R. prowazekii involve both lymphocytes and macrophages, but R. prowazekii can also injure cells directly in the absence of immune and inflammatory responses. Attachment of R. prowazekii to cell membranes directly increases phospholipase activity, which in turn injures host cell membranes . R. prowazekii may accumulate in vast numbers in individual endothelial cells prior to sudden \"burst release\", which results in death of the host cell.\n【20】 The consequence of the above series of cellular events is the pathologic hallmark of epidemic typhus infection: widespread lymphocytic vasculitis with increased vascular permeability, edema, and activation of humoral inflammatory and coagulation mechanisms. This rickettsia-induced vasculitis may also be accompanied by mural and intimal thrombosis and microscopic areas of hemorrhage. Involvement of the microcirculation can produce diffuse myocarditis as well as damage to muscle, spleen, kidneys, and brain. Central nervous system involvement may result in characteristic \"typhus nodules\" composed of perivascular infiltrates consisting of lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma and mast cells.\n【21】 The molecular basis for Brill-Zinsser disease, defined as the recrudescence of epidemic typhus years after the initial episode, remains unclear. In particular, the mechanism by which R. prowazekii remains latent in humans for decades has not been established .  'Brill-Zinsser disease' below.)\n【22】 ACUTE R. PROWAZEKII INFECTION — R. prowazekii infection produces two distinct clinical syndromes: an acute potentially severe infection that occurs 10 to 14 days after exposure to infected lice, and a recrudescent form called Brill-Zinsser disease that may occur 10 to 50 years after primary infection.\n【23】 Symptoms — The majority of patients with epidemic typhus or sylvatic typhus infection experience the abrupt onset of fever, severe headache, and malaise. Infected patients may also complain of a number of other nonspecific symptoms including cough, abdominal pain, nausea, and diarrhea. They may also have myalgias, which can be severe . The relative frequencies with which these symptoms occur are illustrated by the findings of two studies of 104 patients :\n【24】 Rash — The rash of epidemic typhus classically begins several days after the onset of symptoms, appearing as a red macular or maculopapular eruption on the trunk that later spreads centrifugally to the extremities. The rash, which may be difficult to see in dark-skinned individuals, is classically described as sparing the palms and soles, but many exceptions to this rule occur. In severe cases, the rash may become petechial; gangrene of the distal extremities necessitating amputation is a rare complication.\n【25】 The rash is usually present on both the trunk and extremities but may be limited to one or the other site in some patients . The incidence of the rash becoming petechial is variable, ranging in these two reports from 18 to 55 percent.\n【26】 Rash may or may not be present in patients with sylvatic typhus. In two separate series describing a total of 15 patients, rash occurred in seven and was petechial in two . In another report, none of four patients with sylvatic typhus developed a skin rash .\n【27】 Central nervous system manifestations — The majority of patients with epidemic typhus manifest one or more abnormalities in central nervous system function. Common neurologic symptoms include confusion and drowsiness. Coma, seizures, and focal neurologic signs may develop in a minority of patients. In an outbreak of epidemic typhus in a jail in Burundi, seven of nine patients had one or more neurologic signs or symptoms, including seizures in one and coma in three . Similar symptoms can occur with sylvatic typhus .\n【28】 Other complications — Jaundice, elevated serum aminotransferases, and thrombocytopenia are common findings in patients with epidemic typhus. Clinical and laboratory evidence of myocarditis and diffuse or focal pulmonary infiltrates on chest x-ray occur in a small percentage of patients.\n【29】 BRILL-ZINSSER DISEASE — Brill-Zinsser disease is defined as the recrudescence of epidemic typhus years after the initial episode . In contrast to acute primary infection, Brill-Zinsser disease is generally a mild illness. Severe symptoms and death are rare, primarily occurring in elderly and debilitated patients .\n【30】 The onset of Brill-Zinsser disease is typically abrupt with chills, fever, headache, and malaise. Nonspecific gastrointestinal and pulmonary symptoms are also present in many patients. Because affected patients are often elderly, symptoms such as confusion, dyspnea, or lethargy may be erroneously attributed to preexisting or coexistent cardiac, cerebrovascular, or pulmonary disease . The disease may also occur in patients who previously developed sylvatic epidemic typhus associated with flying squirrels .\n【31】 Rash is present in most patients with Brill-Zinsser disease, typically beginning four to six days after the onset of symptoms. The rash is often scant or evanescent and is only rarely petechial.\n【32】 The results from a study involving a mouse model of recrudescent typhus suggest that doxycycline treatment given promptly to patients with primary infections due to epidemic typhus may reduce the risk of subsequent Brill-Zinsser disease .\n【33】 DIAGNOSIS — Serologic tests are the mainstay of diagnosis since isolation of R. prowazekii is generally impractical. Two serologic tests are widely available: an indirect immunofluorescent antibody test and an immunoblot technique. Neither can reliably separate acute primary infection from Brill-Zinsser disease . Both forms of R. prowazekii infection are associated with a fourfold increase in antibody titers between acute and convalescent specimens taken at least two weeks apart, similar to other rickettsial diseases.\n【34】 These tests are available in most state health departments, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and a few specialized research laboratories. The polymerase chain reaction-based assays for detection of R. prowazekii in swabs from eschar, tissue, or whole blood are also available through the CDC .\n【35】 PREVENTION\n【36】 Delousing — Eradication of human infestation with lice will prevent transmission of epidemic typhus. As noted above, people who live and work in close proximity to louse-infested individuals may secondarily acquire lice even if they regularly wash their clothes and have good hygiene. Thus, all louse-infested persons and individuals in close contact with such persons should use long-acting insecticides.\n【37】 Human lice can be treated with agents such as DDT, malathion, and lindane, but reports of resistance to one or more of these agents have appeared. Pyrethroid permethrin, when applied as a dust or spray to clothing or bedding, is highly effective against lice and is the delousing agent of choice. Fabric treated with permethrin retains toxicity to lice even after 20 washings, thereby offering significant long-term passive protection against epidemic typhus .\n【38】 Antibiotic prophylaxis — The use of chloramphenicol or tetracycline for prophylaxis may be highly effective in interrupting typhus outbreaks. Since even a single dose of doxycycline provides protection against epidemic typhus, some experts recommend the use of one 200 mg dose of doxycycline once weekly by travelers or health care workers residing in areas in which epidemic typhus is present. Prophylaxis is generally continued for one week after leaving such areas.\n【39】 Vaccination — Studies performed decades ago showed that an inactivated vaccine provided a moderate degree of protection against experimental R. prowazekii infection . Furthermore, a reduced incidence of typhus occurred among individuals vaccinated with both inactivated and an experimental E-strain vaccine. However, because of licensing concerns and additional concerns that spontaneous reversion of live E-strain may revert to a more virulent strain, the E-strain vaccine is not currently available or in use .\n【40】 Environmental control — In areas where flying squirrels are common, such as cabins in parks and campgrounds, openings in attic vents and roof joists should be sealed with metal screening to prevent squirrels from nesting in areas in close proximity to humans .\n【41】 TREATMENT — As in other rickettsial diseases, tetracyclines and chloramphenicol are the most effective agents for epidemic typhus. The drug of choice is doxycycline. In a small study from Rwanda, for example, a single 200 mg oral dose of doxycycline cured 35 of 37 patients; the two remaining patients had a relapse six and seven days after initial response . While the optimal duration of therapy is unproven, most experts recommend treating for at least seven days or until the patient has been afebrile for at least 48 hours, whichever is longer.\n【42】 However, medical facilities are often inadequate in areas of the world in which epidemic typhus is seen. An alternative to doxycycline is the empiric administration of chloramphenicol 500 mg orally or intravenously four times daily for five days. While inferior, this regimen is effective for epidemic typhus and simultaneously covers meningococcemia and typhoid fever, infections that can mimic many or all of the clinical features of R. prowazekii infection. Other alternate agents with some reported activity against R. prowazekii include azithromycin and rifampin; however, failures with these agents are well documented, and they are clearly inferior to standard therapy with doxycycline .\n【43】 Most patients treated with doxycycline or chloramphenicol improve markedly within 48 hours following the initiation of therapy. In the series from Rwanda, 29 of 37 patients were afebrile 48 hours after therapy was started . Supportive care, including fluids, vasopressors, oxygen, and even dialysis, may be required in patients with severe illness.\n【44】 PROGNOSIS — The prognosis is dependent upon a number of factors, including the age, underlying nutritional status, and health of the patient and the speed with which therapy is administered. In the preantibiotic era, the mortality rates for epidemic typhus were related to age and gender, being higher in older patients and males. In the modern era, mortality is uncommon if either tetracycline or chloramphenicol is given. In a series of 60 hospitalized patients, for example, none of those treated with chloramphenicol or tetracycline died . Most patients remained ill during the first 48 hours of therapy but rapidly improved thereafter. However, in another report of an outbreak of epidemic typhus, two of nine patients died despite receiving chloramphenicol therapy .\n【45】 The prognosis of Brill-Zinsser disease is generally good. However, rare fatalities have been described .\n", "title": "Epidemic typhus", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/epidemic-typhus?search=%E7%89%99%E9%AB%93%E5%BC%82%E5%B8%B8%E7%A1%AC%E5%8C%96%E7%BB%84%E7%BB%87%E5%BD%A2%E6%88%90&source=search_result&selectedTitle=11%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 19:44:39"}

Consult drug interactions database for more information.\n【25】 Warnings/Precautions\n【26】 Angioedema: At any time during treatment (especially following first dose), angioedema may occur rarely with ACE inhibitors; it may involve the head and neck (potentially compromising airway) or the intestine (presenting with abdominal pain). African-Americans and patients with idiopathic or hereditary angioedema or previous angioedema associated with ACE inhibitor therapy may be at an increased risk. Risk may also be increased with concomitant use of mTOR inhibitor (eg, everolimus) therapy. Prolonged frequent monitoring may be required especially if tongue, glottis, or larynx are involved as they are associated with airway obstruction. Patients with a history of airway surgery may have a higher risk of airway obstruction. Aggressive early and appropriate management is critical. Use in patients with previous angioedema associated with ACE inhibitor therapy is contraindicated.\n【27】 Cholestatic jaundice: A rare toxicity associated with ACE inhibitors includes cholestatic jaundice, which may progress to fulminant hepatic necrosis; discontinue if marked elevation of hepatic transaminases or jaundice occurs.\n【28】 Cough: An ACE inhibitor cough is a dry, hacking, nonproductive one that usually occurs within the first few months of treatment and should generally resolve within 1-4 weeks after discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor. Other causes of cough should be considered (eg, pulmonary congestion in patients with heart failure) and excluded prior to discontinuation.\n【29】 Electrolyte disturbances: Hyperkalemia may occur with ACE inhibitors; risk factors include renal dysfunction, diabetes mellitus, and concomitant use of potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, and/or potassium-containing salts. Use cautiously, if at all, with these agents and monitor potassium closely. Thiazide diuretics may cause hypokalemia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypomagnesemia, and hyponatremia.\n【30】 Gout: In certain patients with a history of gout, a familial predisposition to gout, or chronic renal failure, gout can be precipitated by hydrochlorothiazide. This risk may be increased with doses ≥25 mg (Gurwitz 1997).\n【31】 Hypersensitivity reactions: Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions can occur with ACE inhibitors. Severe anaphylactoid reactions may be  with high-flux dialysis membranes (eg, AN69), and rarely, during low density lipoprotein apheresis with dextran sulfate cellulose. Rare cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been reported in patients undergoing sensitization treatment with hymenoptera (bee, wasp) venom while receiving ACE inhibitors. Hypersensitivity reactions may also occur with hydrochlorothiazide; risk is increased in patients with a history of allergy or bronchial asthma.\n【32】 Hypotension/syncope: Symptomatic hypotension with or without syncope can occur with ACE inhibitors (usually with the first several doses); effects are most often observed in volume-depleted patients; correct volume depletion prior to initiation; close monitoring of patient is required especially with initial dosing and dosing increases; blood pressure must be lowered at a rate appropriate for the patient's clinical condition. Although dose reduction may be necessary, hypotension is not a reason for discontinuation of future ACE inhibitor use especially in patients with heart failure where a reduction in systolic blood pressure is a desirable observation.\n【33】 Neutropenia/agranulocytosis: Another ACE Inhibitor, captopril, has been associated with rare cases of agranulocytosis, neutropenia, or leukopenia with myeloid hypoplasia. Patients with renal impairment are at high risk of developing neutropenia. Patients with both renal impairment and collagen vascular disease (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) are at an even higher risk of developing neutropenia. Periodically monitor CBC with differential in these patients.\n【34】 Ocular effects: Hydrochlorothiazide may cause acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma, typically occurring within hours to weeks following initiation; discontinue therapy immediately in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain. Additional treatments may be needed if uncontrolled intraocular pressure persists. Risk factors may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.\n【35】 Photosensitivity: Photosensitization may occur.\n【36】 Renal function deterioration: May be associated with deterioration of renal function and/or increases in serum creatinine, particularly in patients with low renal blood flow (eg, renal artery stenosis, heart failure) whose glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is dependent on efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction by angiotensin II; deterioration may result in oliguria, acute renal failure, and progressive azotemia. Small increases in serum creatinine may occur following initiation; consider discontinuation only in patients with progressive and/or significant deterioration in renal function.\n【37】 Skin cancer, nonmelanoma: Prolonged use (≥3 years) may increase the risk for squamous cell carcinoma up to 4 times and increase the risk for basal cell carcinoma up to 1.25 times compared to patients not treated with hydrochlorothiazide (Pedersen 2018; Pottegård 2017).\n【38】 Sulfonamide (“sulfa”) allergy: The FDA-approved product labeling for many medications containing a sulfonamide chemical group includes a broad contraindication in patients with a prior allergic reaction to sulfonamides. There is a potential for cross-reactivity between members of a specific class (eg, two antibiotic sulfonamides). However, concerns for cross-reactivity have previously extended to all compounds containing the sulfonamide structure (SO2NH2). An expanded understanding of allergic mechanisms indicates cross-reactivity between antibiotic sulfonamides and nonantibiotic sulfonamides may not occur or at the very least this potential is extremely low (Brackett 2004; Johnson 2005; Slatore 2004; Tornero 2004). In particular, mechanisms of cross-reaction due to antibody production (anaphylaxis) are unlikely to occur with nonantibiotic sulfonamides. T-cell-mediated (type IV) reactions (eg, maculopapular rash) are less well understood and it is not possible to completely exclude this potential based on current insights. In cases where prior reactions were severe (Stevens-Johnson syndrome/TEN), some clinicians choose to avoid exposure to these classes.\n【39】 Aortic stenosis: Use with caution in patients with severe aortic stenosis; may reduce coronary perfusion resulting in ischemia.\n【40】 Bariatric surgery: Dehydration: Avoid diuretics in the immediate postoperative period after bariatric surgery; electrolyte disturbances and dehydration may occur. Diuretics may be resumed, if indicated, once oral fluid intake goals are met (Ziegler 2009).\n【41】 Cardiovascular disease: Initiation of therapy in patients with ischemic heart disease or cerebrovascular disease warrants close observation due to the potential consequences posed by falling blood pressure (eg, MI, stroke). Fluid replacement, if needed, may restore blood pressure; therapy may then be resumed. Discontinue therapy in patients whose hypotension recurs.\n【42】 Collagen vascular disease: Use enalapril with caution in patients with collagen vascular disease especially with concomitant renal impairment; may be at increased risk for hematologic toxicity. Hydrochlorothiazide can cause systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) exacerbation or activation.\n【43】 Diabetes: Use hydrochlorothiazide with caution in patients with prediabetes or diabetes mellitus; may see a change in glucose control.\n【44】 Hepatic impairment: Use caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment; in progressive or severe liver disease, avoid electrolyte and acid/base imbalances that might lead to hepatic encephalopathy/coma.\n【45】 Hypercalcemia: Thiazide diuretics may decrease renal calcium excretion; consider avoiding use in patients with hypercalcemia.\n【46】 Hypercholesterolemia: Use with caution in patients with moderate or high cholesterol concentrations; increased cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been reported with thiazides.\n【47】 Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) with outflow tract obstruction: Use with caution in patients with HCM and outflow tract obstruction since reduction in afterload may worsen symptoms associated with this condition.\n【48】 Parathyroid disease: Thiazide diuretics reduce calcium excretion; pathologic changes in the parathyroid glands with hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia have been observed with prolonged use; should be discontinued prior to testing for parathyroid function.\n【49】 Renal artery stenosis: Use fosinopril with caution in patients with unstented unilateral/bilateral renal artery stenosis. When unstented bilateral renal artery stenosis is present, use is generally avoided due to the elevated risk of deterioration in renal function unless possible benefits outweigh risks.\n【50】 Renal impairment: Use ACE inhibitors with caution in pre-existing renal insufficiency; not recommended for use in patients with CrCl <30 mL/minute or serum creatinine ≥3 mg/dL. Avoid rapid dosage escalation which may lead to further renal impairment. Cumulative effects of hydrochlorothiazide, including azotemia, may develop in patients with impaired renal function. Contraindicated in anuric patients.\n【51】 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): Thiazide diuretics can cause SLE exacerbation or activation.\n【52】 Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and renin inhibitors: Concomitant use of an ARB or renin inhibitor (eg, aliskiren) is associated with an increased risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and renal dysfunction. Concomitant use with aliskiren should be avoided in patients with GFR <60 mL/minute and is contraindicated in patients with diabetes mellitus (regardless of GFR).\n【53】 Pediatric: Safety and efficacy have not been established in children.\n【54】 Pregnancy: [US Boxed Warning]: Drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin system can cause injury and death to the developing fetus. Discontinue as soon as possible once pregnancy is detected.\n【55】 Surgery: In patients on chronic ACE inhibitor therapy, intraoperative hypotension may occur with induction and maintenance of general anesthesia; use with caution before, during, or immediately after major surgery. Cardiopulmonary bypass, intraoperative blood loss, or vasodilating anesthesia increases endogenous renin release. Use of ACE inhibitors perioperatively will blunt angiotensin II formation and may result in hypotension. However, discontinuation of therapy prior to surgery is controversial. If continued preoperatively, avoidance of hypotensive agents during surgery is prudent (Hillis, 2011).\n【56】 Dosage Forms: US\n【57】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【58】 Tablet, Oral:\n【59】 Generic: Fosinopril sodium 10 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, Fosinopril sodium 20 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg\n【60】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【61】 Yes\n【62】 Pricing: US\n【63】 10-12.5 mg (per each): $1.48 - $3.09\n【64】 20-12.5 mg (per each): $1.48 - $3.09\n【65】 Administration: Adult\n【66】 Use: Labeled Indications\n【67】 Medication Safety Issues\n【68】 Older Adult: High-Risk Medication:\n【69】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【70】 None known.\n【71】 Drug Interactions\n【72】 Ajmaline: Sulfonamides may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Ajmaline.

Management of persistent postoperative delirium is addressed separately.   \"Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis\", section on 'Management'.)\n【2】 Other problems that occur in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) are discussed separately.   \"Overview of post-anesthetic care for adult patients\".)\n【3】 Most patients become more fully conscious (ie, awake and aware of surroundings and identity) within approximately 15 minutes of extubation, and all patients should be responsive within 60 minutes after the last administration of any sedative, opioid, or anesthetic agent . However, the time required for return of consciousness varies depending on the specific anesthetic and analgesic agents employed (including their dosing, duration, and time since last administration)  'Risk factors for prolonged drug effects' below); the type and duration of the surgical procedure; and the patient's preoperative physical and mental status. Evidence also suggests that recovery of consciousness and loss of consciousness are different processes with specific mechanisms in the brain, and that return of consciousness is partly dependent on external and internal stimuli .\n【4】 If the patient remains unresponsive or heavily sedated 30 to 60 minutes after last administration of any anesthetic or adjuvant agent, further evaluation and treatment target the most common as well as the most serious conditions .\n【5】 An assessment should be made of the total and most recent doses of each anesthetic and adjuvant agent. Occasionally, a dosing error or accidental administration of an unintended anesthetic or adjuvant drug (eg, a syringe swap) may contribute to delayed emergence.\n【6】 Combinations of anesthetic and adjuvant agents – When anesthetic drugs from different classes are combined, the central nervous system (CNS) effects are often synergistic. Synergy is particularly common when drugs acting primarily on GABAA receptors (eg, midazolam, propofol, etomidate) are combined with drugs acting on other receptor types .   \"General anesthesia: Intravenous induction agents\".)\n【7】 Preoperative prescription and other drugs – Potentiation of CNS effects may also occur due to interactions of anesthetic agents with preoperative prescription drugs, supplements, recreational drugs, or alcohol .\n【8】 Several conditions may alter drug metabolism, elimination, or sensitivity and contribute to delayed emergence:\n【9】 Hepatic or renal insufficiency – In patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency, decreased drug metabolism and clearance result in an increased duration of action for most intravenous (IV) anesthetic and adjuvant agents .\n【10】 Age and weight – Age-related changes in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics intensify and prolong CNS effects of anesthetic and adjuvant agents in older adults.   \"Anesthesia for the older adult\".)\n【11】 Standard drug dosing in patients with very low body weight may result in absolute overdose, while relative overdose is common in patients with obesity who receive weight-based dosing of anesthetic agents.   \"Anesthesia for the patient with obesity\", section on 'Dosing anesthetic drugs'.)\n【12】 Hypothermia – Hypothermia slows metabolism and elimination of most anesthetic and adjuvant agents.  'Consider temperature and metabolic derangements' below.)\n【13】 Hypothyroidism – Severely hypothyroid patients have impaired ventilatory drive and respiratory muscle weakness, which renders them more sensitive to the effects of sedatives, opioids, and neuromuscular blocking agents .   \"Respiratory function in thyroid disease\", section on 'Hypothyroidism' and  \"Anesthesia for patients with thyroid disease and for patients who undergo thyroid or parathyroid surgery\", section on 'Hypothyroidism'.)\n【14】 If opioid overdose is the most likely cause of heavy sedation, then a small dose of IV naloxone 40 to 80 mcg may be administered. Administration of naloxone may avoid reintubation, and also rules out opioid-induced alteration in mental status to allow evaluation of other possible causes. Repeat 40 mcg doses of naloxone may be administered at two- to five-minute intervals until the patient is responsive, without evidence of respiratory depression. The half-life of naloxone is 1 to 1.5 hours, which may be shorter than the half-life of the opioid being reversed. In rare cases, a continuous infusion of naloxone is necessary to treat recurrent respiratory depression, with close observation and titration of the infusion rate according to patient response\n【15】 In rare cases, flumazenil is administered if a high dose of midazolam or longer-acting benzodiazepine (eg, lorazepam) is the most likely cause of excessive sedation and severe respiratory depression\n【16】 Recovery from an IV sedative-hypnotic infusion depends on the agent's context-sensitive half time (the time required for plasma concentrations to decline by 50 percent following discontinuation of a steady-state infusion), as well as the duration of infusion. For example, recovery time and awakening typically occur <25 minutes after discontinuation of a propofol infusion administered at maintenance doses for three hours .   \"Maintenance of general anesthesia: Overview\", section on 'Sedative-hypnotic agent: Propofol'.)\n【17】 There are no reversal agents for any IV sedative-hypnotic. Somnolent patients are frequently stimulated to encourage ventilation and prevent exacerbation of sedation due to hypercapnia.\n【18】 Although inhalation agents are unlikely to be a factor for excessive somnolence for more than a few minutes after initial emergence from general anesthesia, their effects are synergistic with opioids and other anesthetic agents  'Risk factors for prolonged drug effects' above). Thus, patients are stimulated frequently to encourage adequate ventilation during transport from the operating room and the first several minutes in the PACU, thereby avoiding hypoventilation and elimination of any residual inhalation anesthetic agent.\n【19】 A pharmacologic reversal agent (eg, neostigmine [up to 5 mg] given with glycopyrrolate [up to 1 mg], or sugammadex 2 mg/kg) is administered if residual blockade is suspected or confirmed with a peripheral nerve stimulator. If muscle weakness persists after administration of maximum doses of NMBA reversal agents, temporary controlled mechanical ventilation may be necessary.   \"Respiratory problems in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU)\", section on 'Neuromuscular blocking agents'.)\n【20】 Temperature derangements are promptly treated.\n【21】 Hypothermia – Even mild hypothermia <35°C may impair consciousness and potentiate CNS-depressant effects of anesthetic agents. Warming in the PACU is typically achieved using forced-air warming devices. If temperature is <33°C, a period of controlled mechanical ventilation is typically necessary while the patient is rewarmed.   \"Perioperative temperature management\", section on 'Hypothermia'.)\n【22】 The most common cause of hypothermia is environmental exposure that occurred in the operating room, but certain medical conditions may exacerbate it (eg, hypoglycemia, adrenal insufficiency, sepsis, hypothyroidism).   \"Perioperative temperature management\", section on 'Intraoperative hypothermia'.)\n【23】 Hyperthermia – Elevated temperature >38°C may cause mental status changes. The most common causes of hyperthermia are accidental overwarming and postoperative fever. Blankets are removed, evaporative cooling measures may be employed, and acetaminophen 650 mg is administered if fever is the cause.   \"Perioperative temperature management\", section on 'Fever or hyperthermia'.)\n【24】 Malignant hyperthermia should also be considered, particularly if sinus tachycardia and/or masseter or generalized muscle rigidity are present, or if laboratory studies reveal hypercarbia, metabolic acidosis, and/or hyperkalemia.   \"Malignant hyperthermia: Diagnosis and management of acute crisis\".)\n【25】 Other details regarding evaluation and management of postoperative fever are discussed separately.   \"Fever in the surgical patient\".)\n【26】 Glucose and electrolyte levels are checked and abnormalities are promptly treated.\n【27】 Glucose – Either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia may cause sedation requiring prompt treatment.\n【28】 Acute severe hypoglycemia (<50 mg/dL) is treated with an IV bolus of 25 to 50 g of dextrose, followed by a continuous dextrose infusion, with measurement of blood glucose concentrations every 30 to 60 minutes. Reversal of CNS symptoms may lag behind normalization of glucose levels.\n【29】 Treatment of severe hyperglycemia is discussed separately.   \"Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Treatment\".)\n【30】 Sodium – Treatment of hyponatremia and hypernatremia are discussed separately.   \"Overview of the treatment of hyponatremia in adults\" and  \"Treatment of hypernatremia in adults\".)\n【31】 Perioperative hyponatremia may occur in patients with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)    \"Causes of hypotonic hyponatremia in adults\"). Hyponatremia may also be caused by a nonconductive (ie, nonelectrolyte) irrigation solution used during hysteroscopy or transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or bladder (TURB).   \"Hyponatremia following transurethral resection, hysteroscopy, or other procedures involving electrolyte-free irrigation\".)\n【32】 Perioperative hypernatremia may occur due to infusion of large volumes of saline or bicarbonate, intraoperative insensible water losses, or diabetes.   \"Etiology and evaluation of hypernatremia in adults\".)\n【33】 Hypermagnesemia – Hypermagnesemia (>4 mEq/L) typically resolves with cessation of magnesium therapy (eg, IV magnesium infusion for treatment of eclampsia or preeclampsia). In the setting of renal insufficiency, patients with hypermagnesemia are treated with isotonic IV fluids plus a loop diuretic (eg, furosemide) in addition to discontinuing any magnesium therapy; dialysis may be required.   \"Hypermagnesemia: Causes, symptoms, and treatment\".)\n【34】 Hypercalcemia – Postoperative hypercalcemia may occur in patients who had surgery for hyperparathyroidism or malignancy; treatment is discussed separately.   \"Treatment of hypercalcemia\".)\n【35】 Neurologic causes of delayed emergence are more common in patients undergoing specific types of surgery, as noted below, particularly after craniotomy for neurosurgical procedures (eg, intracranial vascular procedures, tumor resection, evacuation of hematoma, trauma). In such cases, evaluation should include the surgeon to rule out possible surgical complications.   \"Anesthesia for craniotomy in adults\", section on 'Delayed emergence'.)\n【36】 Depending on the results of the initial examination and after assessment of possible causes as noted above, an urgent neurologic consultation and neuroimaging study may be requested to evaluate the possibility of an acute intracranial event such as:\n【37】 Acute stroke – Acute perioperative stroke may be caused by cerebral ischemia or intracranial hemorrhage. Although perioperative stroke is uncommon in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, those undergoing carotid endarterectomy, aortic or peripheral vascular surgery, or resection of head and neck tumors are at higher risk than other surgical patients . In some cases, the event may not be apparent in the PACU, but occurs a few hours or days later. The evaluation and management of acute stroke is discussed separately.   \"Perioperative stroke following noncardiac, noncarotid, and nonneurologic surgery\" and  \"Initial assessment and management of acute stroke\".)\n【38】 Seizures – A postictal state or nonconvulsive seizures are unusual causes of obtundation in the PACU.\n【39】 Perioperative seizures occasionally occur due to epilepsy, acute stroke, surgery for traumatic brain injury, intracranial tumor, cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation, local anesthetic or other drug toxicity, or alcohol withdrawal\n【40】 Evaluation and management of nonconvulsive seizures are discussed separately.   \"Nonconvulsive status epilepticus: Classification, clinical features, and diagnosis\".)\n【41】 Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy – Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy may follow a precipitating perioperative event such as cardiac arrest or profound hypotension. Evaluation and treatment are discussed separately.   \"Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in adults: Evaluation and prognosis\".)\n【42】 Elevated intracranial pressure – Acute elevation of intracranial pressure may occur after surgery for intracranial hematoma or tumor, or because of cerebral edema (eg, severe traumatic brain injury, large cerebral infarction, acute hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy), malfunctioning ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt, or obstruction of cerebral venous outflow (eg, venous sinus thrombosis, jugular vein compression, neck surgery). Evaluation and treatment are discussed separately.   \"Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults\".)\n【43】 Prior neurologic deficits – Transient focal neurologic deficits may occur after sedation or general anesthesia in patients with a prior history of neurologic insult from stroke or other cause; this phenomenon is known as differential awakening. Such deficits typically improve over 30 minutes to several hours, but multidisciplinary evaluation is required.   \"Anesthesia for craniotomy in adults\", section on 'Differential emergence or awakening'.)\n【44】 Hyperperfusion syndrome – Cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome is a rare sequela of carotid endarterectomy.   \"Complications of carotid endarterectomy\", section on 'Hyperperfusion syndrome'.)\n【45】 Air embolism or fat embolism syndrome – Focal neurologic deficits or mental status changes may occur shortly after surgery due to arterial air embolism  or fat embolism syndrome .   \"Air embolism\", section on 'Surgery and trauma' and  \"Fat embolism syndrome\".)\n【46】 In one prospective observational study that employed the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) criteria in 400 adult patients, intraoperative agitation during emergence occurred in 19 percent . A prospective observational study that employed a different method of assessment, the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) in 1970 adult patients, 3.7 percent had evidence of emergence delirium in the operating room immediately after extubation, while only 1.3 percent remained delirious shortly after admission to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) . Another observational study used the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale in 1000 patients undergoing orthopedic or abdominal surgery, noting \"inadequate emergence,\" (defined as a score ≥2) in 10 percent upon arrival in the PACU, although 2 percent had a score ≥2 before the surgical procedure . In this study, patients with positive scores for delirium had a longer duration of anesthesia.\n【47】 In some patients, postoperative delirium persists or reoccurs after initial emergence from anesthesia, or only becomes evident in the PACU . A lucid period usually is evident after initial emergence from general anesthesia, but not always. Postoperative delirium may manifest as agitation (hyperactive subtype) or as somnolence with altered mental status (hypoactive subtype) occurring in the postoperative period after initial emergence from general anesthesia . Hyperactive delirium is more easily detected due to overt agitation, hyperexcitability, disinhibition, crying, restlessness, and mental confusion; some patients fluctuate between the hyper- and hypoactive subtypes . In a study that employed the CAM-ICU criteria, 31 percent of 400 adult patients were delirious upon admission to the PACU after general anesthesia . Approximately one-half of these patients exhibited hyperactive delirium, while one-half had the hypoactive subtype. The incidence of delirium decreased to 15 percent after 30 minutes, 8 percent after 60 minutes, and only 4 percent at the time of PACU discharge. Most of those with persistent delirium throughout their PACU stay had the hypoactive subtype (92 percent), and all met other criteria for discharge from the PACU . Pediatric patients have a higher incidence of delirium during and shortly after emergence from general anesthesia compared with adults.   \"Emergence delirium and agitation in children\".)\n【48】 In patients with hyperactive emergence delirium, other causes include acute pain due to surgery or other discomfort (eg, bladder distention) or panic due to dyspnea and respiratory distress caused by residual neuromuscular blockade.  'Neuromuscular blocking agents' above.)\n【49】 Initial management of emergence delirium and/or agitation includes:\n【50】 Reassurance and reorientation.\n【51】 Treatment of acute pain. However, the clinical effect of each opioid dose is closely monitored because opioids may precipitate delirium . Nonopioid agents and techniques are preferred, if effective.   \"Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis\", section on 'Prevention' and  \"Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis\", section on 'Management'.)\n【52】 Treatment of other discomfort (bladder distention, hypothermia).   \"Overview of post-anesthetic care for adult patients\".)\n【53】 Laboratory testing to determine if hypoxemia, hypercarbia, hypoglycemia, or electrolyte imbalances are present.\n【54】 Consideration of effects of certain residual anesthetic agents (eg, benzodiazepines, opioids, scopolamine, diphenhydramine).\n【55】 Consideration of preoperative substance abuse (eg, alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, cannabinoids). If suspected, a toxicology screen may provide useful information.   \"Testing for drugs of abuse (DOAs)\".)\n【56】 Consideration of other drug toxicity, including agents that may cause serotonin syndrome\n【57】 In a severely agitated PACU patient, after treatment of reversible causes of delirium, and if redirection and reorientation have failed, administration of a small dose of haloperidol (eg, 0.5 to 2 mg) is reasonable, and this dose may be repeated (up to approximately 5 mg total dose). Because haloperidol does not worsen the overall course of delirium, we prefer it rather than a benzodiazepine to sedate a patient with severe agitation who is a danger to himself or others.   \"Sedative-analgesic medications in critically ill adults: Properties, dose regimens, and adverse effects\".)\n【58】 However, prophylactic haloperidol to prevent delirium is not recommended. Antipsychotics are on the Beers criteria list as drugs to avoid in older adults   \"Drug prescribing for older adults\", section on 'Beers criteria'). In one multicenter study, medical and surgical patients older than 70 years were randomized to receive haloperidol or placebo on top of nonpharmacologic strategies to prevent delirium . There were no differences in delirium incidence, duration, or severity. Similarly, other antipsychotics (either typical or atypical) have not altered delirium incidence, duration, or severity in either general medical or postoperative critically ill patients, and may confer harm .\n【59】 A neurology consult is obtained if delirium is severe and persistent, although an acute intracranial event such as stroke is a rare cause. Delirium lasting hours or days is associated with older age, preoperative cognitive impairment, alcohol use, severe medical illness, and specific laboratory abnormalities (eg, sodium or glucose levels) . Delirium at the time of PACU discharge is predictive of persistent delirium later in the postoperative course, with outcomes that are worse than patients without this complication (eg, mortality, prolonged length-of-stay in the hospital, institutionalization at discharge) .   \"Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis\".)\n【60】 Mitigation strategies and management of persistent postoperative delirium are discussed separately.   \"Perioperative neurocognitive disorders in adults: Risk factors and mitigation strategies\" and  \"Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis\", section on 'Management'.)\n【61】 Delayed emergence\n【62】 Management of persistent delay in emergence or delirium – A basic neurologic examination is performed if delayed emergence or delirium persists after assessment for other causes\n【63】 Causes and management of persistent delirium are discussed separately.   \"Perioperative neurocognitive disorders in adults: Risk factors and mitigation strategies\" and  \"Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis\", section on 'Management'.)\n", "title": "成人苏醒延迟及苏醒期谵妄", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/delayed-emergence-and-emergence-delirium-in-adults?search=%E5%8D%B1%E9%99%A9%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E9%95%87%E9%9D%99%E5%89%82%E3%80%81%E5%82%AC%E7%9C%A0%E8%8D%AF%E6%88%96%E9%95%87%E9%9D%99%E5%89%82&source=search_result&selectedTitle=2%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:09:53"}

Severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions may occur in any organ system or tissue. Reactions generally occur during treatment (may occur at any time after dostarlimab initiation); reactions may also occur after dostarlimab discontinuation. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are necessary to ensure safe use of dostarlimab. If suspected immune-mediated reactions occur, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative causes (including infection). Medically manage immune-mediated adverse reactions promptly and refer for specialty consultation as appropriate.\n【70】 Dermatologic toxicity: Immune-mediated rash or dermatitis may occur. Bullous and exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have occurred with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies.\n【71】 Endocrinopathies: Dostarlimab is associated with immune-mediated endocrinopathies.\n【72】 GI toxicity: Immune-mediated colitis has occurred, including cases of grade 2 and 3 colitis. Systemic corticosteroids were administered to most patients for immune-mediated colitis. The majority of patients with colitis experienced resolution of symptoms. In cases where dostarlimab was withheld for colitis, all reinitiated treatment after symptom improvement; recurrence occurred in one patient. Cytomegalovirus infection or reactivation has been observed in patients with corticosteroid-refractory, immune-mediated colitis. Pancreatitis (including increased serum amylase and lipase levels), gastritis, and duodenitis have also been reported.\n【73】 Hepatotoxicity: Immune-mediated hepatitis (grade 3) has occurred with dostarlimab. Systemic corticosteroids were used in most patients to manage immune-mediated hepatitis; hepatitis resolved in most patients.\n【74】 Infusion-related reactions: Infusion-related reactions (including severe and life-threatening cases) have occurred with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies; a grade 3 severe infusion-related reaction has been reported with dostarlimab.\n【75】 Nephrotoxicity: Immune-mediated nephritis (including tubulointerstitial nephritis) with kidney dysfunction has occurred, all of which were grade 2. Systemic corticosteroids may be required. Nephritis resolved in most affected patients.\n【76】 Ocular toxicity: Immune-mediated uveitis, iritis, and other ocular inflammatory toxicities may occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Differing grades of visual impairment (including blindness) may occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome.\n【77】 Pulmonary toxicity: Immune-mediated pneumonitis has been observed, including grades 2 to 4 cases. Most patients required management with systemic corticosteroids. Pneumonitis resolved in nearly 80% of the affected patients. In cases where dostarlimab was withheld for pneumonitis, some reinitiated dostarlimab after symptom improvement; pneumonitis recurred in some patients. Pneumonitis incidence may be increased in patients with a history of prior thoracic radiation.\n【78】 Other immune-mediated toxicities: Other clinically relevant immune-mediated disorders have been observed rarely with dostarlimab (or other anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies) and may affect any organ system (may be fatal), including myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis, meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy, myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae including kidney failure), arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatic, hypoparathyroidism, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenia, and solid organ transplant rejection.\n【79】 Hematopoietic cell transplant: Fatal and other serious complications may occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) before or after treatment with an anti-PD-L1/PD-1 monoclonal antibody. Transplant-related complications included hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute or chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (also known as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome) after reduced-intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (with no identified infectious etiology). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-L1/PD-1 blockade and HCT. Manage early signs/symptoms of transplant-related complications promptly. Assess the risks/benefits of treatment with an anti-PD-L1/PD-1 monoclonal antibody prior to or after an allogenic HCT.\n【80】 Myasthenia gravis: Checkpoint inhibitors may worsen or precipitate new myasthenia gravis (MG), especially within the first 16 weeks of treatment; use with caution. Patients with well-controlled MG may be considered for checkpoint inhibitor therapy if MG treatment is maintained (or reinitiated in patients whose MG is in remission), combination therapy (eg, anti-CTLA-4 with anti-PD-a/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies) is avoided, and respiratory and bulbar function are closely followed. In patients who develop overt MG during checkpoint inhibitor therapy, early aggressive treatment with plasma exchange or IVIg in combination with high-dose corticosteroids may be required (AAN [Narayanaswami 2021]).\n【81】 Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and kidney and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984).

Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【105】 Corticosteroids (Systemic): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (Anti-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -CTLA4 Therapies). Management: Carefully consider the need for corticosteroids, at doses of a prednisone-equivalent of 10 mg or more per day, during the initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Use of corticosteroids to treat immune related adverse events is still recommended Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【106】 Efgartigimod Alfa: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Fc Receptor-Binding Agents. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【107】 Inhibitors of the Proton Pump (PPIs and PCABs): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (Anti-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -CTLA4 Therapies). Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【108】 Ketoconazole (Systemic): Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (Anti-PD-1, -PD-L1, and -CTLA4 Therapies) may enhance the hepatotoxic effect of Ketoconazole (Systemic).  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【109】 Rozanolixizumab: May diminish the therapeutic effect of Fc Receptor-Binding Agents. Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【110】 Reproductive Considerations\n【111】 Verify pregnancy status prior to treatment initiation.\n【112】 Patients who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy and for 4 months after the last dose of dostarlimab.\n【113】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【114】 Dostarlimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG4). Human IgG crosses the placenta. Fetal exposure is dependent upon the IgG subclass, maternal serum concentrations, placental integrity, newborn birth weight, and GA, generally increasing as pregnancy progresses. The lowest exposure would be expected during the period of organogenesis and the highest during the third trimester (Clements 2020; Palmeira 2012; Pentsuk 2009).\n【115】 Based on the mechanism of action, in utero exposure to dostarlimab may lead to an immune-mediated rejection of the fetus, resulting in fetal death.\n【116】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【117】 It is not known if dostarlimab is present in breast milk.\n【118】 Dostarlimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG4). Human IgG is present in breast milk; concentrations are dependent upon IgG subclass and postpartum age (Anderson 2021).\n【119】 Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed infant, breastfeeding is not recommended by the manufacturer during therapy and for 4 months after the last dostarlimab dose.\n【120】 Monitoring Parameters\n【121】 Mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) status (in tumor specimens) in dMMR advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer or solid tumors. For primary advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, assess dMMR or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) status in tumor specimens. In high-grade glioma, test for dMMR in the primary tumor specimen (obtained prior to temozolomide initiation). Monitor LFTs (AST, ALT, and total bilirubin; at baseline and periodically during treatment); kidney function (serum creatinine; at baseline and periodically during treatment); thyroid function (at baseline, periodically during treatment, and as clinically indicated); monitor blood glucose (for hyperglycemia). Verify pregnancy status prior to therapy initiation (in patients who can become pregnant). Monitor closely for signs/symptoms of immune-mediated adverse reactions, including adrenal insufficiency, diarrhea/colitis (consider initiating or repeating infectious workup in patients with corticosteroid-refractory, immune-mediated colitis to exclude alternative causes), dermatologic toxicity, diabetes mellitus, hypophysitis, ocular disorders, thyroid disorders, pneumonitis, and other immune-mediated adverse reactions. Monitor for signs/symptoms of infusion-related reactions. If received/receiving hematopoietic stem cell transplant, monitor closely for early signs/symptoms of transplant-related complications.\n【122】 The American Society of Clinical Oncology hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening and management provisional clinical opinion (ASCO [Hwang 2020]) recommends HBV screening with hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, total Ig or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen prior to beginning (or at the beginning of) systemic anticancer therapy; do not delay treatment for screening/results. Detection of chronic or past HBV infection requires a risk assessment to determine antiviral prophylaxis requirements, monitoring, and follow-up.\n【123】 Cardiovascular monitoring: Comprehensive assessment prior to treatment including a history and physical examination, screening for cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking (ASCO [Armenian 2017]). Obtain baseline ECG, natriuretic peptides, and troponins in all patients; obtain a baseline echocardiogram in high-risk patients; consider serial ECGs and cardiac troponins prior to doses 2, 3, and 4, and if normal, reduce to every 3 doses until completion of therapy; cardiovascular risk assessment every 6 to 12 months in high-risk patients who require long-term therapy (>12 months therapy, consider cardiovascular risk assessment every 6 to 12 months in all patients requiring long-term therapy) (ESC [Lyon 2022]). Refer to a cardiologist when clinically indicated.\n【124】 Additional suggested monitoring (ASCO [Schneider 2021]): Prior to therapy: CBC with differential, serum chemistries, creatine kinase, comprehensive clinical assessment including performance status, weight, BMI, heart rate, BP, and oxygen saturation; consider chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, and CT scan; assess history of autoimmune conditions, organ-specific disease, endocrinopathies, neuropathy, and infectious disease; assess bowel habits, respiratory symptoms, skin (for rash), arthralgias, and neurologic symptoms. During therapy: Assess BP, weight, heart rate, and oxygen saturation; assess for infections, screen for hyperglycemia/diabetes (polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss); eye exam (including intraocular pressure after 6 weeks), CBC with differential, serum chemistries, and creatine kinase; monitor bone mineral density (with long-term therapy).\n【125】 Mechanism of Action\n【126】 Dostarlimab is an anti-PD-1 humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody which inhibits programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) activity by binding to the PD-1 receptor on T-cells to block PD-1 ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2) from binding. Blocking the PD-1 pathway inhibits the negative immune regulation caused by PD-1 receptor signaling (Hamid 2013).\n【127】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【128】 Distribution: Vdss: ~5.8 L.\n【129】 Metabolism: Expected to be metabolized by catabolic pathways into small peptides and amino acids.\n【130】 Half-life elimination: 23.5 days.\n【131】 Excretion: Clearance: 0.007 L/hour (at steady state).\n【132】 Brand Names: International\n【133】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Dostarlimab  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/dostarlimab-drug-information?search=%E6%80%A5%E6%80%A7%E9%97%B4%E8%B4%A8%E6%80%A7%E8%82%BA%E7%82%8E&source=search_result&selectedTitle=107%7E114&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:03:42"}

The review summarizes the many potential consequences of poor sleep in hospitalized adults, including respiratory and cardiovascular dysfunction, immune dysregulation, altered metabolism, increased pain and anxiety, and cognitive and behavioral dysfunction. A multifaceted approach is recommended through enhanced awareness of the problem, individual patient-level interventions, and hospital-wide efforts to make the inpatient environment as conducive as possible to obtaining good sleep.   \"Poor sleep and insomnia in hospitalized adults\", section on 'Interventions to improve sleep'.)\n【2】 Patients with systolic heart failure (HF) benefit from a multidrug medical regimen, but barriers to achieving optimal therapy include therapeutic inertia, adverse effects, and polypharmacy. In a recent randomized trial in nearly 200 inpatients with systolic HF, virtual consultation by an HF cardiologist and pharmacist resulted in more appropriate changes to medical therapy than usual care . In particular, compared with the usual care group, more patients in the virtual consultation group had intensification of HF therapy or initiation of new HF medications. Inpatients with HF benefit from specialist review of their medical regimen, which may result in durable changes that lead to lower risks of mortality or future HF hospitalizations.   \"Systems-based strategies to reduce hospitalizations in patients with heart failure\", section on 'Decision support'.)\n【3】 Multivariable models can accurately estimate the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS), but it remains unclear whether the use of such models to direct treatment improves quality of care or health outcomes. In a recent randomized trial that included nearly 3100 patients with suspected NSTEACS, patients assigned to management with the Grace Risk Score were not more likely to have guideline-recommended care and did not have lower rates of cardiovascular outcomes when compared with those assigned to usual care . However, 20 percent of the enrolled patients did not have a final diagnosis of NSTEACS, and management was assigned by center in a crossover fashion; these factors may have biased the trial result toward no effect. In patients with NSTEACS, use of a risk score may complement other methods of clinical assessment, but the approach to management is typically determined by objective signs of ongoing ischemia and other patient factors such as recent stenting.   \"Non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndromes: Selecting an approach to revascularization\", section on 'Evidence of infarction (NSTEMI)'.)\n【4】 In patients with heart failure (HF) who present to the emergency department, the decision to discharge or admit is often determined on a case-by-case basis. In a recent trial that included nearly 5500 patients with HF who were randomly assigned to triage with a decision-support algorithm (ie, triage to home- or hospital-based management based on risk of readmission) or usual care, those in the decision-support group had a lower risk of death or rehospitalization within 30 days . The largest differences in management occurred in high-risk patients who were more likely to be admitted in the decision-support group. In patients with HF who present to the emergency department for evaluation, the decision to discharge or admit may be improved with the use of a decision-support algorithm.   \"Systems-based strategies to reduce hospitalizations in patients with heart failure\".)\n【5】 Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare, autoantibody-mediated syndrome of thrombocytopenia and thrombosis (central venous thrombosis is common) that can occur after vaccination with an adenoviral-vectored COVID-19 vaccine. The clinical syndrome is similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. A new report describes two individuals with a similar syndrome and VITT-like autoantibodies following documented adenovirus infection . Neither patient had COVID-19 and neither received a COVID-19 vaccine. This finding suggests that a component of the adenoviral sequence may provide the source of the neoantigen. The inflammatory response to infection could provide the \"second hit\" that causes the syndrome.   \"COVID-19: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT)\", section on 'Mechanisms/triggers of antibody formation'.)\n【6】 For patients hospitalized for COVID-19 who require high-flow oxygen or ventilatory support, we suggest adding baricitinib or tocilizumab to dexamethasone to further reduce mortality. Other immunomodulatory agents may also improve outcomes. In a randomized trial of patients with severe COVID-19, most of whom were on remdesivir and glucocorticoids, infliximab and abatacept each reduced 28-day mortality compared with placebo (10 and 11 versus 15 percent) but did not improve time to clinical improvement . The trial did not detect a benefit with cenicriviroc. Despite their potential efficacy, we do not routinely use infliximab or abatacept for COVID-19, because they do not offer clear advantages over baricitinib or tocilizumab, which have more established benefit and, in the United States, are approved for this indication.   \"COVID-19: Management in hospitalized adults\", section on 'Limited roles for alternative immunomodulators'.)\n【7】 The Duke criteria for diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE) have been revised to reflect changes in the epidemiology of IE, as well as new imaging and diagnostic tools . The 2023 Duke-International Society for Cardiovascular Infectious Disease criteria classify Enterococcus faecalis as a typical cause of IE regardless of acquisition site (eg, community or healthcare associated) or presence of a primary extracardiac focus; previously E. faecalis was included as a major criterion only if community acquired and in the absence of a primary focus. The criteria also incorporate advances in microbiologic diagnostic testing, such as tissue polymerase chain reaction (such as amplicon or metagenomic sequencing and in situ hybridization). Advances in imaging include improved understanding of the diagnostic utility of cardiac computed tomography (CT) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with CT for detection of IE.   \"Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected left-sided native valve endocarditis\", section on 'Basis for Duke criteria revision'.)\n【8】 In May 2023, an outbreak of fungal meningitis was reported in the United States among patients who had cosmetic procedures under epidural anesthesia in the city of Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico . The causative agent was identified as Fusarium solani species complex. As of June 14, 2023, 18 suspected, 10 probable, and 6 confirmed cases have been reported; four of these patients died. Persons who received epidural anesthesia at River Side Surgical Center or Clinica K-3 since January 2023 should be evaluated for meningitis, regardless of symptoms. Empiric therapy with liposomal amphotericin B plus voriconazole should be initiated in those with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. Updated information on this outbreak can be found on the CDC website.   \"Aseptic meningitis in adults\", section on 'Fusarium outbreaks'.)\n【9】 A medical mask or respirator should be used during routine care of persons with COVID-19; however, data supporting the use of one over the other are conflicting. As an example, in a randomized trial of 1009 health care providers from four different countries, the overall rate of RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases was similar with medical mask versus respirator use (10.46 versus 9.27 percent, respectively) . However, in one country (Canada), the use of a respirator was associated with a lower risk of symptomatic infection. Pending additional high-quality data, we continue to suggest respirators when providing routine care for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 to reduce exposure via the aerosol route.   \"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection\", section on 'Type of PPE'.)\n【10】 Diagnosing aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) can be challenging in patients with isolated headache whose initial bleeding is minor because head computed tomography (CT) can miss small bleeds. Morbidity and mortality risk associated with misdiagnosis causes many centers to perform a follow-up lumbar puncture to assess for blood in the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with no evidence of bleeding on CT. However, the sensitivity of high-quality head CT ranges from 95.5 to 100 percent among patients with isolated headache when performed within six hours of the onset of symptoms, potentially rendering a follow-up lumbar puncture unnecessary. Updated guidelines from the American Heart Association now endorse use of head CT to exclude SAH for selected patients when imaging performed within six hours of symptom onset is normal . For properly selected patients\n【11】 The updated Boston criteria version 2.0\n【12】 There is no consensus about when to start or resume anticoagulation after acute ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). The main concern is that early anticoagulation may increase the risk of intracranial hemorrhage, particularly for large strokes. In the recent ELAN trial of early direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) therapy (within 48 hours after minor/moderate stroke or on day 6 or 7 after major stroke) versus later DOAC therapy (day 3 or 4 after minor stroke, day 6 or 7 after moderate stroke, or day 12 to 14 after major stroke) in over 2000 patients with AF and acute ischemic stroke, there was a nonsignificant trend towards benefit of early DOAC therapy on the composite primary outcome and on rates of recurrent stroke at 30 and 90 days . Meanwhile, rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were similar between groups. While not definitive, these findings suggest that early DOAC use is safe and may reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke.   \"Early antithrombotic treatment of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack\", section on 'Timing of long-term anticoagulation'.)\n【13】 In adult patients with acute nonhypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure, the benefits of high-flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannulae (HFNC) compared with conventional low-flow oxygen (COT) are unclear. A recent meta-analysis of six trials (over 2700 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure) reported that while HFNC did not reduce 28-day mortality compared with COT, it did significantly reduce the rate of reintubation (relative risk 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.97) . These data support the use of HFNC in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who have escalating oxygen needs.   \"Evaluation and management of the nonventilated, hospitalized adult patient with acute hypoxemia\", section on 'Humidified, high-flow oxygen delivered via nasal cannulae (HFNC)'.)\n", "title": "What's new in hospital medicine", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/whats-new-in-hospital-medicine?search=%E6%84%8F%E5%9B%BE%E4%B8%8D%E7%A1%AE%E5%AE%9A%E7%9A%84%E8%A2%AB%E4%BB%96%E4%BA%BA%E5%87%BB%E6%89%93%E3%80%81%E8%B8%A2%E8%B9%AC%E6%88%96%E7%A2%B0%E6%92%9E&source=search_result&selectedTitle=83%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:50", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:38:59"}

As a result, it is one of the most important public health problems.\n【2】 An overview of the sequelae of mTBI is presented here. The evaluation and management of acute mTBI are discussed separately.   \"Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults\".)\n【3】 DEFINITIONS — mTBI occurs with head injury due to contact and/or acceleration/deceleration forces. It is typically defined as mild by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15, measured at approximately 30 minutes after the injury  because they seem more similar with regard to prognosis and incidence of intracranial abnormalities .\n【4】 The term \"concussion\" is often used in the medical literature as a synonym for mTBI. The Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology defines concussion as a trauma-induced alteration in mental status that may or may not involve loss of consciousness . Consensus definitions of concussion are discussed in detail separately.   \"Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults\", section on 'Definitions'.)\n【5】 SEQUELAE — The prognosis for complete recovery from mTBI is good for an appropriately managed concussion . Nonetheless, there are a variety of short- and long-term sequelae that have important implications.\n【6】 Second impact syndrome — Second impact syndrome occurs when a person develops altered mental status or loss of consciousness within seconds to minutes of a second concussion when they are still symptomatic from an earlier concussion . This is a rare and somewhat controversial but also potentially fatal complication of mild brain injury .\n【7】 A 2021 literature review identified only 45 cases, all males between the ages of 10 to 29 (including seven over the age of 20 years). The latency between first and second concussions ranged from less than one hour to five weeks. There were 11 recoveries or favorable outcomes and 19 deaths . It has never been reported in American National Football League (NFL) players.\n【8】 It is hypothesized that impaired cerebral autoregulation leads to cerebrovascular congestion and malignant cerebral edema with increased intracranial pressure . There is no specific treatment for this condition; management focuses on mitigating increased intracranial pressure.   \"Evaluation and management of elevated intracranial pressure in adults\".)\n【9】 Return-to-play protocols aim to prevent second impact syndrome.   \"Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults\", section on 'Return to play for athletes'.)\n【10】 Postconcussion syndrome — Postconcussion symptoms may result from brain injury or from trauma involving head and neck structures. These include headache, dizziness (including vertigo and nonspecific dizziness), neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment, and sleep dysregulation. These typically develop in the first days after mTBI and generally resolve within a few weeks to a few months. At least one study suggests that a history of a prior concussion, particularly if recent or multiple, is a risk factor for prolonged symptoms after concussion . Repeated concussions can cause cumulative neuropsychologic deficits (ie, increasing severity and duration of mental status abnormalities after each separate incident) .\n【11】 Postconcussion syndrome is discussed in more detail separately.   \"Postconcussion syndrome\".)\n【12】 Posttraumatic headaches — Headaches occur in 25 to 78 percent of patients after mTBI . According to the International Headache Society (IHS) criteria, the onset of the posttraumatic headaches should be within seven days after the injury . The seven-day onset is arbitrary; some suggest that three months seems a more reasonable latency for onset than does seven days . Headaches may represent a specific injury to the head or neck, may be nonspecific in character, and may have a symptom pattern indistinguishable from other nontraumatic headache syndromes such as migraine and tension headache .\n【13】 The clinical features, evaluation, and treatment of posttraumatic headaches are discussed in detail separately.   \"Post-traumatic headache\".)\n【14】 Sleep disturbances — Sleep-wake disturbances are among the most prevalent and persistent sequelae of mTBI. Patients suffering from TBI of any severity, in both the acute and chronic phases, commonly report excessive daytime sleepiness, increased sleep need, insomnia, and sleep fragmentation .\n【15】 The evaluation and treatment of sleep-wake disturbances after mTBI are discussed in detail separately.   \"Sleep-wake disorders in patients with traumatic brain injury\".)\n【16】 Posttraumatic epilepsy — Data conflict as to whether mTBI is associated with an increased risk of epilepsy. Seizures occurring within the first week of injury are acute symptomatic events and are not considered epilepsy. Half of the seizures consistent with posttraumatic epilepsy will occur in the first year; 80 percent will occur within two years. Prophylactic treatment with antiseizure medications does not prevent posttraumatic epilepsy and is not recommended.\n【17】 Posttraumatic seizures and epilepsy are discussed in detail separately.   \"Posttraumatic seizures and epilepsy\".)\n【18】 Posttraumatic vertigo and dizziness — The incidence of posttraumatic vertigo has not been well characterized in prospective studies. Posttraumatic vertigo and dizziness is a substantial contributor to disability after mTBI .\n【19】 Head injury may lead to vertigo by a variety of mechanisms, each of which has a relatively distinct clinical syndrome . It is important to identify the source of vestibular symptoms in order to appropriately manage the patient .\n【20】 Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo — Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) that occurs after a head injury is presumably caused by shearing and displacement of otoconia, which then settle into one of the semicircular canals, most often the posterior canal.\n【21】 BPPV produces isolated paroxysms of positionally induced vertigo . There may be a hiatus of weeks and even months between the injury and the onset of BPPV. Evaluation of patients with BPPV after trauma may identify that more than one semicircular canal is involved, a phenomenon that is more common than in patients with idiopathic BPPV (55 versus 6.5 percent in one series) .\n【22】 Some but not all studies suggest that BPPV following mTBI may be more difficult to treat than in other settings, require more treatment sessions, and be more prone to recurrences .\n【23】 The evaluation and management of BPPV is described in detail separately.   \"Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo\".)\n【24】 Convergence insufficiency — Convergence insufficiency (CI) is an increasingly recognized oculomotor impairment following mTBI. In some series, CI is identified in 40 to 55 percent of individuals who are systematically examined after an uncomplicated concussion . The pathogenesis or neuroanatomic basis of CI is not well understood.\n【25】 Patients with CI do not typically report diplopia, but instead have ill-defined dizziness, nonspecific visual complaints (eg, blurred vision, difficulty tracking a moving target), and/or vision-related functional impairments that manifest as reduced performance in school or work. On examination, CI is characterized by a remote near point of convergence and reduced fusional vergence. Outward eye deviation greater at near than at distance is seen in some patients, particularly those with a latent strabismus . Not all patients with CI on examination are symptomatic; CI is found in approximately 5 percent of the healthy population .\n【26】 Studies suggest that CI contributes to total symptom burden and neuropsychiatric impairments after mTBI . Observational studies suggest that vision therapy can substantially improve symptoms as well as objective deficits .\n【27】 Other clinical syndromes — In addition to BPPV, described above, other mechanisms of traumatic vestibular system injury include:\n【28】 Direct injury to the cochlear and/or vestibular structures usually occurs in the setting of transverse fractures of the temporal bone . Hemotympanum and sensorineural hearing loss often occur along with vertigo. Facial palsy may also occur if the seventh cranial nerve is injured. The symptoms are maximal at onset and progressively improve in most patients over weeks and months due to compensation within the central nervous system.\n【29】 Labyrinthine concussion may occur from blunt injury to the membranous labyrinth from hitting the otic capsule . This may occur with abrupt changes of head motion not necessarily associated with impact.\n【30】 Labyrinthine concussion produces acute onset of vertigo and postural instability, often with tinnitus and hearing loss. Symptoms are maximal at the time of symptom onset and improve over days to months, usually somewhat more quickly than with temporal bone fractures, as described above.\n【31】 Perilymphatic fistula occurs when trauma causes rupture of the oval or round window and presents with sudden unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and acute, persistent, gradually diminishing vertigo and imbalance. Perilymphatic fistula can be difficult to diagnose and treat.   \"Causes of vertigo\", section on 'Perilymphatic fistula'.)\n【32】 Vertebral artery dissection may accompany mTBI, and typically produces a lateral medullary infarction or Wallenberg syndrome. Patients present with acute onset of vertigo, which is sustained and often dominates the clinical presentation. Neck pain is common but not invariable. Transient ischemic attacks are relatively infrequent in this setting. While symptoms may develop at the time of injury, it is more common for there to be a delay of a day to a few weeks.\n【33】 The clinical manifestations of lateral medullary infarction and vertebral artery dissection are discussed in detail separately.   \"Posterior circulation cerebrovascular syndromes\", section on 'Lateral medullary infarction' and  \"Cerebral and cervical artery dissection: Clinical features and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)\n【34】 Vestibular migraine produces episodic vertigo, with episodes typically lasting several minutes to a few hours, some of which are associated with migraine headache and/or other migrainous phenomenon. In one series of 58 active-duty or retired military personnel with dizziness after mTBI, 41 percent were diagnosed with vestibular migraine .   \"Vestibular migraine\".)\n【35】 Epileptic vertigo is rare, and is usually associated with a temporal lobe focus. Episodes are brief (less than a few minutes), stereotyped, and respond to antiseizure medication   \"Causes of vertigo\", section on 'Epileptic vertigo').\n【36】 Temporal lobe seizures and posttraumatic seizures are discussed in detail separately.   \"Focal epilepsy: Causes and clinical features\", section on 'Neocortical temporal lobe epilepsy' and  \"Posttraumatic seizures and epilepsy\".)\n【37】 Posttraumatic Meniere disease (MD) has been described in isolated case reports ; it may be that the association is spurious as symptoms reportedly develop months to years after the trauma. Patients with MD present with tinnitus, fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, and episodic vertigo lasting several minutes to a few hours. The evaluation and treatment of MD is discussed separately.   \"Meniere disease: Evaluation, diagnosis, and management\".)\n【38】 Cervicogenic dizziness is a controversial and somewhat inconsistently defined entity . In case series, commonly described features include neck pain and subjective dizziness, usually in association with a whiplash injury. In many  but not all cases , dizziness seemed to recover in association with treatment of the neck condition, whether that be physical therapy, medications, or surgery.\n【39】 A specific neuroanatomic basis of this entity is not defined but may involve impaired neck proprioception, which in turn affects vestibular processing .\n【40】 Nonspecific dizziness is a component of postconcussion syndrome. Sometimes described as vertigo, it may also be characterized by patients as a floating or swaying sensation or as unsteadiness or imbalance .   \"Postconcussion syndrome\".)\n【41】 Evaluation and treatment — Appropriate management of posttraumatic vertigo requires identification of the pathologic mechanism(s) involved . Identification of the most likely underlying pathology is based upon salient clinical features, in particular whether the vertigo is episodic versus sustained and whether there are accompanying symptoms or signs (algorithm 1).\n【42】 While the approach to the evaluation of posttraumatic vertigo is similar to that of patients who have not had head injury, evaluation (and management) may be complicated by the fact that there may be more than one site and mechanism of vestibular injury in the same patient .   \"Evaluation of the patient with vertigo\" and  \"Causes of vertigo\".)\n【43】 Some case series also indicate that posttraumatic dizziness and vertigo are somewhat more refractory to treatment than their idiopathic counterparts, perhaps because of multiple contributing pathologic injuries . However, two small randomized trials suggest that vestibular therapy may provide benefit in this setting .\n【44】 Other cranial nerve injuries — The risk of injury to other cranial nerves increases with the severity of brain injury, but these can also occur in mTBI with an incidence of 0.3 percent according to one case series . The distribution is similar to that for moderate or severe head injuries:\n【45】 Anosmia and hyposmia, which are often reported by the patient as impaired taste as well as smell, occur following injury to olfactory filaments as they enter the brain through the cribriform plate. While recovery occurs in approximately one-third of patients, loss of smell is likely permanent if present one year after the injury .   \"Taste and olfactory disorders in adults: Anatomy and etiology\".)\n【46】 Diplopia may result from injury to cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. In the setting of mTBI, injury to cranial nerve IV is most common, followed by VI. Cranial nerve III is less commonly affected by mTBI.   \"Overview of diplopia\" and  \"Fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) palsy\", section on 'Traumatic'.)\n【47】 Facial pain and occipital neuralgia may occur in association with mTBI. The former usually occurs in the setting of blunt force injury to the trigeminal nerve in the face, such as supraorbital neuropathy, while occipital nerve injury may be indirect from a contiguous musculoskeletal injury in the neck.   \"Overview of craniofacial pain\".)\n【48】 Facial nerve palsy suggests a possible fracture to the temporal bone, which should be specifically evaluated.   \"Skull fractures in adults\".)\n【49】 Chronic traumatic encephalopathy — Repeated concussions appear to cause cumulative neuropsychologic deficits (ie, increasing severity and duration of mental status abnormalities after each separate incident) . Cognitive impairment, psychologic symptoms (behavior and personality changes, depression, suicidality), parkinsonism, and other speech and gait abnormalities are described .\n【50】 Epidemiology and pathogenesis — The incidence and prevalence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are unknown, as most studies involve a biased sample. Studies have focused on populations at risk of repetitive TBI, in particular athletes and military personnel.\n【51】 Sports-related concussion – Increasing reports of dementia among NFL players with a history of multiple concussions have focused attention on this entity, which has been labeled \"chronic traumatic encephalopathy\" in this setting . A convenience sample of deceased NFL players found CTE in 110 of 111 . One cohort study found that neurodegenerative disease-related mortality was three times higher in retired NFL players compared with the general United States population; Alzheimer disease (AD)-related mortality was four times higher . Cumulative effects of repeated concussions have also been implicated in cognitive impairments among college football players  and poorer neuropsychologic functioning in amateur and professional soccer players .\n【52】 Chronic neurologic impairment has also long been recognized as a sequelae of boxing, and has been called \"dementia pugilistica\" in this setting . The incidence is approximately 20 percent in professional boxers, and is much lower, perhaps negligible, in amateur boxers . The number of professional bouts (typically more than 20) appears to be more important than the number of \"knockouts\" . The total number and type of head blows, particularly if the angle of impact or failure to stabilize the head results in rotational head movements, may be important as well.\n【53】 Combat-related TBI – Single as well as multiple combat-related blast injuries in military personnel have also been identified as a precursor to CTE .\n【54】 Observational studies are inconclusive but suggest that severity of the TBI event as determined by symptom severity and disability duration appears to increase the risk of CTE . However, no threshold of injury with regard to number or severity has been established. The fact that concussion relies on self-report is another limitation of these studies. Age and sex have an undetermined role in predicting risk, although at least one subsequent study suggested that older age at the time of TBI increases the risk of subsequent dementia .\n【55】 Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype may be a risk factor for CTE as it is for AD. In one series of 30 boxers, APOE genotype was associated with severity of neurologic deficits among high- but not low-exposure boxers . In a similar study of 53 professional football players, older patients with APOE genotype were more likely to have cognitive impairment than those without the APOE genotype . However, other studies suggest that APOE epsilon 4 is not associated with increased burden of neuropsychologic deficits after TBI . It has been suggested that recurrent brain injury, and perhaps single brain injuries as well, may activate pathologic mechanisms similar to those that cause brain degeneration in AD . Some investigations suggest that trauma may incite a chronic neuroinflammatory response, a mechanism that has also been implicated in AD . However, further investigation is required; similarities and associations between CTE and AD may reflect a coincidence of the two conditions rather than a causal relationship or shared pathogenesis .\n【56】 Neuropathology — CTE is defined pathologically by extensive tau-immunoreactive degenerative changes that are distinct from other tauopathies (such as AD) in their distribution with preferential involvement of the superficial cortical layers .\n【57】 In 2016, a consensus panel convened by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NINDS/NIBIB) identified the pathognomonic lesion of CTE as an accumulation of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in neurons and astroglia distributed around small blood vessels at the depths of cortical sulci and in an irregular pattern . Supportive but nonspecific p-tau-immunoreactive features and other pathologies of CTE were also identified. These criteria were found to have good agreement between a panel of seven neuropathologists and the diagnosis of CTE .\n【58】 Pathologic findings appear to be specific for CTE. In one study, pathologic findings of CTE were found in 32 percent of brains from 66 individuals with a history of repetitive brain injury and in none of the 198 brains from individuals without this history . A pathologic study in 85 patients found that the severity of pathologic findings could be correlated with the severity of clinical findings .\n【59】 While many consider CTE to be a progressive neurodegenerative disease, the nature of autopsy studies, which are cross-sectional rather than longitudinal, precludes that determination on a pathologic basis .\n【60】 Clinical features — Our understanding of the clinical features of CTE is somewhat limited by the almost exclusive reporting in former professional athletes, thus invoking potential confounding bias . In general, the core clinical features as described include :\n【61】 Cognitive impairments – Including memory and executive function\n【62】 Behavior abnormalities – Aggression, paranoia, impulsivity\n【63】 Mood disorders – Depression, anxiety, suicidality\n【64】 Neuroimaging — Advanced neuroimaging techniques (diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance [MR] spectroscopy) have demonstrated associated white matter and other abnormalities in these patients; however, further studies are needed to define the sensitivity and specificity of specific findings and patterns of findings .\n【65】 Diagnosis and treatment — At present, there is no specific clinical syndrome, neuroimaging feature, or other biomarker that has been shown to reliably identify patients with CTE.\n【66】 Similarly, there is no treatment modality that is known to improve long-term outcomes. Symptoms may be managed empirically, as appropriate.   \"Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia\".)\n【67】 Neurodegenerative disease\n【68】 Motor neuron disease – An association between head injury and motor neuron disease is unproven . This concern was raised when higher-than-expected incidences of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were documented in separate reports of Italian soccer players , American football and soccer players , and Gulf War veterans . However, subsequent studies have not found a definitive association between TBI and ALS .\n【69】 In a neuropathologic autopsy study of 12 former athletes with pathologically confirmed CTE, three also had motor neuron disease . These three, along with seven others, were found to have abundant TDP-43-positive inclusions and neurites in the spinal cord as well. In one study, 24 patients with ALS and a history of head injury had similar rates of disease progression and neuropathologic findings compared with patients with ALS and no head injury .\n【70】 Others – Whether TBI is associated with neurodegenerative disease remains speculative. In one pooled analysis of clinical and neuropathologic data, TBI with loss of consciousness was associated with risk for Lewy body accumulation but not Alzheimer pathology .\n【71】 LATE MORTALITY — At least one cohort study found higher mortality rates in patients with mTBI 13 to 15 years after mTBI (eg, 27.9 versus 13.2 per 1000 per year) . It is uncertain whether lifestyle factors or potential neuropathologic changes account for this observation; however, causes of death were similar among patients and controls. By contrast, other cohort studies have not found late increases in mortality after mTBI , although one of these found that recent TBI (within the past two years) was associated with a higher mortality rate .\n【72】 PREVENTION OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY — The combined acute and chronic morbidity associated with mTBI suggests placing a premium on reducing the number of concussions. Individuals, particularly older patients, who have had one head injury are at increased risk of recurrent head injury .\n【73】 Use of sport-specific helmets has been found to reduce head injuries in sports such as baseball, ice hockey, rugby, and alpine skiing and snowboarding . However, these case-control studies leave open the possibility that the observed effects associated with voluntary use of a helmet are the result of general risk-avoidant behavior rather than the helmet itself. By contrast, helmets have not been found to reduce the rate of head injury in soccer players . Furthermore, in some cases, use of protective equipment may adversely affect playing behavior, encouraging risky behavior, so that the risk of injury actually increases . While American football helmets are widely used, there is no standard for helmet construction to prevent concussions .\n【74】 Bicycle and motorcycle helmets reduce the severity of accident-related head injuries.   \"Bicycle injuries in children: Prevention\".)\n【75】 The National Football League (NFL) has made changes to rules, emphasizing player safety. As an example, in 2009, the return-to-play-from-concussion guideline was amended and blows to the head of a defenseless receiver were prohibited. During the 2010 NFL season, there was increased discipline (increased enforcement, large fines, and possible suspensions) for helmet-to-helmet contact in violation of players' safety rules and a change where the ball is immediately blown dead if a ball-carrier's helmet comes off during a play.\n【76】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Increased intracranial pressure and moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury\" and  \": Minor head trauma and concussion\".)\n【77】 Definitions – Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) occurs with head injury due to contact and/or acceleration/deceleration forces. It is typically defined as mild by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15, measured at approximately 30 minutes after the injury\n【78】 Second impact syndrome – This is a rare but potentially life-threatening phenomenon when diffuse cerebral swelling develops in the setting of a second concussion that has occurred when the patient is still symptomatic from an earlier concussion.  'Second impact syndrome' above.)\n【79】 Posttraumatic vertigo and dizziness – These can be a substantial contributor to disability after mTBI. Head injury may lead to vertigo by a variety of mechanisms (including direct injury to the vestibular apparatus, migraine, and others), each associated with a different clinical syndrome.\n【80】 Treatment is guided by identification of the underlying mechanism. An approach to the evaluation of posttraumatic vertigo is presented in the algorithm (algorithm 1).  'Posttraumatic vertigo and dizziness' above.)\n【81】 Other sequelae – Other complications include postconcussion syndrome, headaches, epilepsy, sleep disturbances, and other cranial nerve deficits.  'Sequelae' above.)\n【82】 Recurrent TBI may also lead to chronic neuropsychologic impairments known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).  'Chronic traumatic encephalopathy' above.)\n【83】 Prevention – While the risks of repeated concussions are not well defined, there is sufficient evidence to support measures that limit repeated injuries. However, the efficacy of individual measures such as helmets is uncertain.

Psychotic symptoms can increase patients’ risk for harming themselves or others or being unable to meet their basic needs.\n【2】 Psychosis may be seen in many psychiatric disorders. It is the core feature of schizophrenia and other conditions in the schizophrenia spectrum and may occur in bipolar disorder and major depression with psychotic features. Psychosis may also be a manifestation of substance use or underlying medical disease.\n【3】 This topic will address initial management of psychosis. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, comorbid conditions, and initial evaluation of psychosis in adults are discussed elsewhere. Maintenance treatment of schizophrenia, management of side effects from antipsychotic medications, and management of mood disorders with psychosis are also discussed elsewhere.\n【4】 INITIAL MANAGEMENT — The initial management of patients with psychosis should include an assessment of the safety risk and level of care indicated. For most patients, treatment involves antipsychotic medication and psychosocial interventions. It is essential to consider collateral information obtained from family members, psychosocial supports, and other providers during initial management decisions.\n【5】 Safety risk and level of care — Treatment of psychosis should take place in the least restrictive environment where safety can be maintained. Inpatient psychiatric hospitalization is needed when the patient is at risk to harm themselves or others. This should be assessed through direct questions about homicidal and suicidal ideation   \"Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults\"). Other considerations include the patient’s ability to secure basic needs, such as food and shelter, to protect oneself from harm, and the presence of family members or other supports who can monitor the patient and alert emergency services if needed.\n【6】 Psychiatric hospitalization can be either on a voluntary or involuntary basis, subject to legal restrictions that vary by jurisdiction. Clinicians, especially those in emergency settings, should become familiar with involuntary treatment criteria and procedures within their legal jurisdictions.\n【7】 Psychiatric consultation — Any patient with an initial or recurrent onset of psychosis should be evaluated by a psychiatrist. Consultation may occur in the emergency department setting, in the inpatient setting, or in the form of an urgent outpatient evaluation.\n【8】 Antipsychotic therapy\n【9】 Indications — For most causes of psychosis, even those in which the psychiatric disorder or underlying medical condition causing the psychosis has not yet been established, we recommend initial symptomatic treatment with an antipsychotic medication. Notable exceptions include patients with psychosis due to central nervous system stimulant intoxication or patients with catatonia, both of which should be treated initially with benzodiazepines.  'Psychosis due stimulant intoxication' below and 'Catatonia' below.)\n【10】 Antipsychotics have been extensively studied and shown to be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia . A network meta-analysis of 402 studies with over 50,000 participants examined the efficacy of over 30 different first- and second-generation antipsychotics in patients with acute symptoms of schizophrenia or related disorders . All antipsychotics were found to reduce overall symptoms more than placebo. Studies used different rating scales for determining symptom improvement; the estimated individual effect sizes for overall symptom improvement ranged from -0.89 to -0.03 standardized mean difference compared with placebo (mean -0.42). Benefits were also reported for positive symptoms (eg, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions), depressive symptoms, and social functioning.\n【11】 While antipsychotics have been most extensively studied in the treatment of schizophrenia, the medications appear to effectively reduce psychotic symptoms due to many different causes. For example, meta-analyses have found antipsychotics are effective in the treatment of psychotic mania in bipolar disorder , major depressive disorder with psychotic features (when combined with an antidepressant) , delirium , psychosis in Parkinson disease , and psychosis in Alzheimer disease . The use and effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs for individual disorders and diseases are discussed separately.\n【12】 Although some patients presenting with psychosis (eg, those with brief psychotic disorder) can recover spontaneously without medication, there are no features that can reliably identify such patients at the time of presentation.   \"Brief psychotic disorder\", section on 'Treatment'.)\n【13】 Selection\n【14】 Preference for second-generation agents — We suggest using a second-generation antipsychotic as first-line treatment in most cases of psychosis .\n【15】 Second-generation antipsychotics are preferred because they tend to cause fewer extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS; ie, akathisia, dystonia, parkinsonism) than first-generation antipsychotics . Meta-analysis comparing overall efficacy and effects of antipsychotics showed less EPS associated with all second-generation antipsychotics studied compared with the first-generation antipsychotic, haloperidol . Aside from this distinction, therapeutic effects and adverse effects are not significantly different between first- and second-generation antipsychotics and likelihood of specific adverse effects are heterogenous within each group. Although clozapine is more effective than other agents, it is reserved for patients who have not responded to other antipsychotics because it has significant side effects and medical risks that require careful monitoring.   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Maintenance therapy and side effect management\" and  \"First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects\" and  \"Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects\" and  \"Schizophrenia in adults: Guidelines for prescribing clozapine\".)\n【16】 Additional patient-specific considerations\n【17】 Psychiatric symptoms — Certain psychiatric features may be a reason for selection of a particular antipsychotic or a particular property of an antipsychotic:\n【18】 Negative symptoms – Negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as diminished emotional expression and lack of motivation, have proven particularly difficult to treat. Most classes of medications tested have not shown clinically meaningful effects on negative symptoms , but cariprazine has shown positive effects in a clinical trial .   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis\", section on 'Negative symptoms'.)\n【19】 In a meta-analysis of 168 randomized trials involving 12,318 individuals with schizophrenia, the effects of several different classes medications on negative symptoms were examined . Small, statistically significant reductions in negative symptoms were found for second-generation antipsychotics, antidepressants, glutamatergic agents, and combinations of these medications, but not for first-generation antipsychotics or brain stimulation. None of the beneficial effects for any of the medication strategies were considered to be of a clinically significant magnitude.   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis\", section on 'Negative symptoms'.)\n【20】 In a clinical trial of 461 patients with stable schizophrenia with predominant negative symptoms, cariprazine was compared with risperidone over a 26-week period . Cariprazine-treated patients had a modestly greater reduction in negative symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (difference in mean change from baseline -1.46, 95% CI -2.4 to -0.5 on a 42 point scale) and improvement in domains of self-care, and social relationships and activities on the Personal and Social Performance Scale (difference in mean change from baseline 4.6, 95% CI 2.7-6.6 on a 100 point scale). Cariprazine did not have a differential effect on positive symptoms, depression, or EPS.  'Negative symptoms' below.)\n【21】 Agitation – We consider agitation to be a psychiatric emergency. Agitation is a state of motor restlessness or excitement and is often accompanied by mental tension and irritability.\n【22】 Insomnia – For insomnia due to underlying psychosis, we suggest an antipsychotic with sedating properties. An example is quetiapine, which can be initiated at 25 mg twice daily and increased every few days by 25 mg twice daily to an initial target dose of 300 to 400 mg daily, depending on response\n【23】 Cardiovascular risk factors\n【24】 Patients with or at risk for metabolic syndrome – For patients with diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, or other uncontrolled cardiovascular risks, we are especially cognizant of choosing an agent that has a lower risk of metabolic side effects\n【25】 Patients at risk for QT prolongation – In patients with congenital long QT and in those at risk for acquired long QT syndrome, we recommend avoiding medications that have a greater association with long QT syndrome\n【26】 Age — Older adult patients (eg, patients older than 70 years) are more susceptible to side effects associated with antipsychotic medication. Particular attention should be paid to anticholinergic side effects such as dry mouth, blurry vision, urinary hesitancy, constipation, and cognitive effects  and sedation.\n【27】 In addition, for older patients, we suggest initiating antipsychotic therapy below or at the lower end of the dose range, for example, aripiprazole 5 to 10 mg per day and titrating every week to two weeks to therapeutic range. In these patients, we recommend careful review of medications and drug interactions prior to starting antipsychotic treatment.  'Initial dosing' below.)\n【28】 Dementia or cognitive impairment — Antipsychotics are associated with risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death when used to treat behavioral symptoms in older adults with dementia, particularly those with underlying vascular disease. Given this increased risk, their use in patients with dementia should be reserved for patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms that are severe or pose safety risks .\n【29】 Use and selection of antipsychotic therapy in patients with dementia is discussed in detail elsewhere.   \"Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia\", section on 'Antipsychotic drugs'.)\n【30】 Selection of antipsychotics in patients with dementia associated with Parkinson disease and parkinsonian disorders warrants additional consideration and is also discussed in detail elsewhere.   \"Management of nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson disease\" and  \"Cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease\" and  \"Palliative approach to Parkinson disease and parkinsonian disorders\".)\n【31】 Administration\n【32】 Initial dosing — In adults, most antipsychotic medications should be titrated from the initial dose to the therapeutic range as quickly as tolerated\n【33】 Timeframe for titration may differ depending on specific properties of medications. As an example, iloperidone and quetiapine should be titrated gradually due to increased risk of orthostasis. Typically, sedation and orthostasis are the limiting factors in titration of antipsychotic medications.\n【34】 If adequate response is achieved before the suggested range is reached, the patient should be monitored for continued response before further titration.\n【35】 Once the dose reaches therapeutic range, we allow several days to one week at that dose to evaluate for effect before deciding to increase the dose further. Examples of initial dosing and titration include the following:\n【36】 Aripiprazole can be started at 10 mg per day to 15 mg per day. Patients should be monitored at this dose for several days before increasing further by 5 to 10 mg per day every few days to maximum dose of 30 mg per day.\n【37】 Risperidone can be started at 2 mg a day, administered either once daily or as 1 mg twice daily. This dose can be increased by 1 mg every one to two days until the initial therapeutic range of 4 mg is reached. We suggest monitoring at this dose for several days to a full week before considering further increase. If the patient shows no improvement the dose can be increased up to 8 mg daily with careful monitoring for side effects and clinical response. Doses above 8 mg per day are associated with substantial risk of EPS.   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Maintenance therapy and side effect management\", section on 'Antipsychotic therapy'.)\n【38】 The objective of dose titration is to maximize efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. Because of dose-related toxicities, antipsychotics should be used at the lowest dose that is sufficiently effective for an individual. In a meta-analysis of clinical trials investigating antipsychotic dosing for acute schizophrenia, medication increases within the therapeutic range were associated with a decrease in symptoms (total and positive symptoms) and a lower rate of medication discontinuation for ineffectiveness in a dose-dependent fashion . However, dose increases were also associated with increased side effects such as akathisia, parkinsonism, and somnolence.\n【39】 Most studies of doses above the recommended range have found no clear benefit. At higher doses, the adverse effects of an antipsychotic may surpass the marginal benefit of dosing increases. As a result, increasing the dose of an antipsychotic for a patient who is already experiencing significant EPS is unlikely to result in additional symptom reduction .\n【40】 If used, trials of higher doses should be limited to three months. Unless clear improvement is seen, higher doses should not be continued .\n【41】 Expected response — Resolution of psychotic symptoms generally begins within several days of reaching an effective dose but may take as much as four to six weeks for full improvement. Most patients who will improve on an antipsychotic show the most rapid improvement during the first two weeks . Evidence suggests that if the patient shows only minimal response to an antipsychotic during the first two weeks, it is unlikely that the individual will have a robust response .  'Adjustments for poor response to initial treatment' below.)\n【42】 Initial effects of antipsychotic medication are often sedation, restlessness, or postural hypotension. It is important to explain to the patient and their family that these side effects are common, or they may conclude that the medication is ineffective or worsening their condition.\n【43】 Adjustments for poor response to initial treatment — If there is no improvement in psychotic symptoms after two to four weeks of a therapeutic dose, we generally suggest changing to a different antipsychotic medication, although this is not always effective. Switching antipsychotics can be helpful when a poor response is related to side effects. It is less clearly beneficial when the initial medication lacked effectiveness. Patients who respond poorly to one antipsychotic may likely be poor responders to another antipsychotic. A meta-analysis investigating treatment of patients who do not respond to the initially prescribed antipsychotic did not find a difference in benefit between increasing the same medication and switching to a different antipsychotic . However, the overall quality of the evidence was low.\n【44】 For patients who are actively psychotic who are switching from an ineffective medication to another choice, we suggest maintaining full dose of the current medication as the new medication is increased. Once the second medication has reached its target dose, the first medication may be gradually decreased and discontinued. In most cases, this change can be managed over two weeks.\n【45】 Clinicians often add a second antipsychotic when patients have suboptimal response to a single drug. We typically do not add a second agent as little empirical evidence supports this practice . Exceptions are discussed elsewhere.   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Maintenance therapy and side effect management\", section on 'Partial response or recurrence of symptoms' and  \"Evaluation and management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia\", section on 'Augmentation with medication'.)\n【46】 Patients who have not responded adequately to two or more trials of antipsychotics at therapeutic dose (eg, >600 mg chlorpromazine or its equivalent) are considered treatment resistant.   \"Evaluation and management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia\".)\n【47】 Duration of pharmacologic therapy — The recommended duration of antipsychotic therapy varies according to the underlying etiology: In chronic schizophrenia, antipsychotics should be offered indefinitely to reduce the risk of relapse . With time-limited psychoses (such as delirium), antipsychotic therapy can be continued for two weeks after the resolution of symptoms and then tapered off gradually.   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Maintenance therapy and side effect management\" and  \"Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis\".)\n【48】 In many cases of psychosis, particularly at initial stages of the illness, the diagnosis is uncertain. In these cases, we consider additional factors that inform the likely diagnosis and subsequent duration of antipsychotic therapy. These factors include patient age, premorbid characteristics such as interpersonal traits, and psychosocial functioning including employment history. Additionally, the severity of symptoms (eg, suicidality) and extent of disruption to daily life functioning should be weighed. As an example, a 20-year-old patient with acute onset of psychosis, chronic mild paranoia, and social isolation will likely need chronic treatment with antipsychotics after initial stabilization because of a relatively high likelihood of schizophrenia. In contrast, a 40-year-old patient with acute onset of psychosis, no premorbid history, and stable psychosocial functioning will likely be treated for several months followed by a trial of discontinuation of medications. In most cases, longitudinal monitoring is needed to make an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Maintenance therapy and side effect management\".)\n【49】 Psychosocial interventions — We recommend psychosocial treatment as an adjunct to antipsychotic medication. Our approach is to implement the most comprehensive psychosocial interventions available; these include cognitive and social training, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and family-based interventions. Most of the evidence for efficacy is in patients with schizophrenia; this is discussed elsewhere.   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Psychosocial management\".)\n【50】 Cognitive remediation and social skills training — These interventions attempt to improve cognitive weaknesses, such as attention and planning, and apply training to focus on specific situations, problems, or activities. The ultimate goal is to generalize the learned skills to community-based activities and improve overall functioning.   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Psychosocial management\", section on 'Cognitive remediation' and  \"Schizophrenia in adults: Psychosocial management\", section on 'Social skills training'.)\n【51】 Cognitive-behavioral therapy — CBT attempts to reduce the intensity of distress related to delusions and hallucinations. CBT promotes active participation of the individual through cognitive reframing, with the ultimate goal of reducing relapse and social disability.   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Psychosocial management\", section on 'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'.)\n【52】 Family-based interventions — Family interventions\n【53】 Early identification and intervention — Early identification and intervention programs seek to identify individuals with prodromal or first episode of psychosis. Efforts are aimed at preventing progression of prodromal syndrome or recurrent psychosis. These include:\n【54】 Education of primary care providers and community outreach to secondary schools and colleges. Referral to mental health programs for diagnosis and treatment is encouraged.\n【55】 Provision of diagnosis-specific multimodal treatment including psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions.\n【56】 Multidisciplinary teams of mental health professionals that work in an integrated fashion and follow patients longitudinally.\n【57】 Meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials have found that early intervention services lead to better clinical outcomes for patients with early phase psychosis compared with treatment as usual . In one meta-analysis of 10 trials and over 2000 patients, subjects were randomized to receive early intervention services or treatment as usual. Patients in early intervention had superior results on all outcomes studied including any psychiatric hospitalization (relative risk 0.74, 95% CI 0.61-0.90), involvement in school or work (relative risk 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.24), and total symptom severity (standardized mean difference -0.32, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.17). Preliminary evidence has also suggested that extended early intervention for up to five years may result in fewer patients disengaging from treatment, although the certainty of the evidence is very low and more studies are needed .\n【58】 Special circumstances\n【59】 First episode of psychosis — Choice of antipsychotic medication in a patient with a first episode of psychosis is the same as for psychosis in general. However, we suggest patients with a first episode of psychosis be treated with an antipsychotic at the lower end of the recommended dose range. For example, for a first episode of psychosis, we recommend starting aripiprazole at 5 mg per day or risperidone starting at 1 mg per day. These can be increased over one week to the lower end of the therapeutic range (ie, 10 mg per day aripiprazole, 2 mg per day risperidone) while monitoring for response. Patients in a first psychotic episode tend to have higher response rates than patients who have experienced multiple psychotic episodes. These individuals respond to lower antipsychotic doses and have greater vulnerability to side effects such as weight gain .\n【60】 Psychosis due stimulant intoxication — When the underlying cause of psychosis or agitation is thought to be stimulant related, we suggest initial treatment with a benzodiazepine rather than an antipsychotic medication. For example, lorazepam can be given at a dose of 2 to 4 mg IV and repeated every 10 minutes. In milder cases, it may be given orally or IM. Antipsychotics can be used as an adjunctive therapy when high doses of benzodiazepines (eg, more than 20 mg of lorazepam in 30 minutes) do not adequately control agitation. Although antipsychotics are reported to be safe and effective in this setting , they may interfere with heat dissipation, lower the seizure threshold, and prolong QT interval.   \"Methamphetamine: Acute intoxication\" and  \"Methamphetamine use disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis\".)\n【61】 Catatonia — Antipsychotic medications should be avoided as they can precipitate or worsen catatonia. Catatonia is a syndrome manifested by inability to move normally. It can present as either extreme negativism (eg, passive resistance to movement), mutism, or catatonic excitement (eg, excessive, purposeless motor activity). The presence of catatonia should alert the clinician to the possibility of an underlying medical disorder and should be thoroughly investigated. Treatment of catatonia is reviewed in more detail elsewhere.   \"Catatonia: Treatment and prognosis\" and  \"Catatonia in adults: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis\".)\n【62】 Negative symptoms — Negative symptoms have a detrimental impact on outcomes and quality of life in individuals with schizophrenia. Negative symptoms appear to cluster in two main components: diminished expression (eg, reduced display of affect and speech) and motivational or volition-apathy symptoms including apathy, asociality, and decreased capacity for pleasure. Most medications have not shown clinically meaningful effects on them .   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis\", section on 'Negative symptoms' and 'Additional patient-specific considerations' above.)\n【63】 Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) may be effective in treating negative symptoms. In a network meta-analysis of 48 trials involving 2211 participants with schizophrenia, treatment over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with excitatory NIBS led to larger reductions in negative symptoms than sham control intervention . NIBS protocols and their effect included: high-definition transcranial random noise stimulation (standardized mean difference -2.19, 95% CI -3.36 to -1.02), intermittent theta-burst stimulation (standardized mean difference -1.32, 95% CI -1.88 to -0.76), anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (standardized mean difference -1.28, 95% CI -2.55 to -0.02), high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; standardized mean difference -0.43, 95% CI -0.68 to -0.18), or extremely high-frequency rTMS (standardized mean difference -0.45, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.12). The comparative efficacy of different NIBS protocols for relieving negative symptoms remains unclear. Further studies are warranted.\n【64】 Psychosocial treatment with a combined program of motivational interviewing and CBT may lead to improvements in negative symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia. In a trial, 79 subjects with schizophrenia and moderate to severe negative symptoms were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of group treatment with combined motivational interviewing and CBT versus 12 weeks of active control group with mindfulness-based stress reduction . At treatment end, individuals in the treatment group showed lower measures on the Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms, Motivation and Pleasure subscale (CAINS-MAP) a nine-item measure of motivation and pleasure, as compared with those in the control group (endpoint scores 1.42 versus 2.05, respectively). Gains were maintained through follow-up, though the benefit for the treatment group was attenuated as compared with control group (follow-up score 1.59 versus 1.75, respectively). Additionally, individuals in the treatment group showed a trend towards greater improvement on the Specific Level of Functioning (SLOF) scale, a 43-item scale for daily functioning and behavior across a range of domains than those in the control group.   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Psychosocial management\".)\n【65】 Comorbidities — Psychosis can occur in the setting of other psychiatric comorbidities such as mood disorders, substance use disorders, and other medical or neurologic disorders. In these cases, the underlying disorder should be treated as appropriate for that particular disorder. These issues are discussed separately.\n【66】 Patients who refuse medications — The approach to patients who refuse medications is driven by the acuity of the symptoms. Patients with agitation or symptoms that put them at risk for dangerous behaviors (eg, severe paranoia leading to agitation or hallucinations commanding violence) often refuse or are unable to take medications. In these cases, we recommend IM or IV treatment; the medication choice depends on the clinical situation.   \"Assessment and emergency management of the acutely agitated or violent adult\".)\n【67】 In cases where the acuity of the psychosis does not warrant IM or IV treatment (eg, mild paranoia), we suggest frequent education of the patient about potential benefits of medication and discussion of reasons for refusal. It is often helpful to engage family members and other supports in order to build alliance with the patient. In cases where adherence becomes problematic, long-acting injectable medications are suggested.   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Pharmacotherapy with long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication\".)\n【68】 Monitoring and follow-up — We recommend follow-up monitoring on a weekly basis with a mental health team to provide pharmacologic and psychosocial treatment. After three months, the frequency can be monthly if the patient continues to be in remission.\n【69】 Medication benefits, side effects, and adherence should be discussed at each visit. Additionally, lipid profile, metabolic profile, and, for patients on a medication associated with QT prolongation, an electrocardiogram should be monitored at regular intervals\n【70】 Patients who have recovered from a first episode of psychosis have a high rate of recurrence following medication discontinuation . For those whose antipsychotic treatment is discontinued, we continue to monitor for relapse in symptoms.  'Duration of pharmacologic therapy' above and  \"Schizophrenia in adults: Maintenance therapy and side effect management\".)\n【71】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": Psychotic disorders\".)\n【72】 Safety risk and level of care – Patients with psychosis are at elevated risk for agitated and aggressive behaviors. All patients with psychosis should be evaluated for risk of harm to themselves or others and their ability to take care of themselves. Patients who are unable to care for themselves or pose a risk to themselves or others should be hospitalized. Severely agitated patients with psychosis may need sedation or physical restraint.  'Safety risk and level of care' above.)\n【73】 Antipsychotic therapy – Antipsychotic medications are an effective symptomatic treatment of psychosis, regardless of underlying cause, and are the standard initial treatment for most cases. Important exceptions include patients with stimulant-related psychosis or catatonia, for whom antipsychotic medications are not given unless the underlying condition is treated.  'Indications' above.)\n【74】 Selection – Antipsychotic drugs are largely similar in efficacy and selection among them is typically made on the basis of patient presentation, the medication’s side effect profile and formulations available\n【75】 Administration – In adults, most antipsychotic medications are titrated from the initial dose to the therapeutic range as quickly as tolerated\n【76】 Patients who refuse medication – In patients who refuse medications, IM or intravenous medication may be needed for those with agitation or symptoms that put them at risk for dangerous behaviors (eg, severe paranoia leading to agitation or hallucinations commanding violence). Otherwise, we continue to educate patients who refuse medications about potential benefits and discuss reasons for refusal.  'Patients who refuse medications' above.)\n【77】 Psychosocial interventions – Psychosocial interventions are an important adjunctive therapy to antipsychotic medications. These interventions include cognitive and social training, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and family-based interventions.  'Psychosocial interventions' above.)\n【78】 Comorbidities – Psychosis can occur in the setting of other psychiatric comorbidities such as mood disorders, substance use disorders, and other medical or neurologic disorders. In these cases, antipsychotic medications are administered in combination with treatment for the underlying or comorbid medical or psychiatric disorder.  'Comorbidities' above.)\n【79】 Monitoring and follow-up – We recommend follow-up monitoring on a weekly basis with a mental health team to provide pharmacologic and psychosocial treatment. After three months, the frequency can be monthly if the patient continues to be in remission.

Use following cataract surgery may delay healing or increase the incidence of bleb formation.\n【21】 Corneal thinning: Various ophthalmic disorders, as well as prolonged use of corticosteroids, may result in corneal and scleral thinning. Continued use in a patient with thinning may result in perforation.\n【22】 Glaucoma: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and/or glaucoma, damage to the optic nerve, and defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. Use with caution in patients with glaucoma; monitor IOP in any patient receiving treatment for ≥10 days.\n【23】 Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), or prolong or exacerbate viral infections. Corticosteroids should not be used to treat ocular herpes simplex. Use extreme caution in patients with a history of ocular herpes simplex; frequent slit lamp microscopy examinations are recommended. Fungal infection should be suspected in any patient with persistent corneal ulceration who has received corticosteroids.\n【24】 Systemic absorption: Studies have demonstrated topical ophthalmic corticosteroids are absorbed systemically and may cause endogenous corticosteroid production reduction. Caution is advised with prolonged use of topical ophthalmic corticosteroids in terms of systemic immunosuppression and additional systemic hazard of corticosteroid exposure (Burch 1968).\n【25】 Contact lens wearers: Some products contain benzalkonium chloride which may be absorbed by soft contact lenses; contact lenses should not be worn during treatment of ophthalmologic infections.\n【26】 Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson,2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995). Thrombocytopenia, ascites, pulmonary deterioration, and renal and hepatic failure have been reported in premature neonates after receiving parenteral products containing polysorbate 80 (Alade 1986; CDC 1984). See manufacturer’s labeling.\n【27】 Appropriate use: For ophthalmic use only. Do not inject subconjunctivally or introduce into the anterior chamber of the eye. A maximum of 20 mL of suspension or a maximum of 8 g of ointment should be prescribed initially; patients should be re-evaluated (eg, intraocular pressure and exams using magnification and fluorescein staining, where appropriate) prior to additional refills. Use >10 days should include routine monitoring of intraocular pressure.\n【28】 Dosage Forms: US\n【29】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【49】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【50】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【51】 Mechanism of Action\n【52】 Gentamicin: Interferes with bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 30S ribosomal subunits resulting in a defective bacterial cell membrane. Gentamicin is active against common staphylococci (coagulase positive and coagulase negative) and streptococci, Diplococcus pneumonia, Haemophillus influenza, and gram-negative species, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Additionally, gentamicin has been found to be effective against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella-Enterobactor-Serratia species, and Citrobacter species.\n【53】 Prednisolone: Reduces inflammation by inhibiting edema, leukocyte migration, fibrin deposition, capillary proliferation and dilation, collagen deposition, and scar formation.\n【54】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【55】 Absorption: Topical application of gentamicin/prednisolone combination drops results in small amounts of the drugs being absorbed systemically.\n【56】 Brand Names: International\n【57】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Prednisolone and gentamicin  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/prednisolone-and-gentamicin-drug-information?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%96%E7%9C%BC%E5%BC%82%E7%89%A9&source=search_result&selectedTitle=70%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:48:18"}

Frequency not defined:\n【34】 Cardiovascular: Bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac failure (especially in susceptible patients), cardiomegaly, circulatory shock, embolism (fat), hypertension, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (premature infants), myocardial rupture (post-myocardial infarction), syncope, tachycardia, thromboembolism, thrombophlebitis, vasculitis\n【35】 Dermatologic: Acne vulgaris, allergic dermatitis, atrophic striae, burning sensation of skin (especially in the perineal area after IV injection), diaphoresis, ecchymoses, erythema of skin, facial erythema, hyperpigmentation, hypertrichosis, hypopigmentation, inadvertent suppression of skin test reaction, skin rash, thinning hair, urticaria, xeroderma\n【36】 Endocrine & metabolic: Adrenocortical insufficiency (secondary unresponsiveness, particularly during trauma, surgery, or illness), Cushing syndrome, decreased serum potassium, drug-induced Cushing’s syndrome, fluid retention, glycosuria, growth retardation, hirsutism, HPA-axis suppression, hyperglycemia (including increased requirements for insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents in diabetes mellitus), hypokalemic alkalosis, impaired glucose tolerance/prediabetes, lipodystrophy, manifestation of prediabetes, menstrual disease, moon face, negative nitrogen balance (due to protein catabolism), pituitary insufficiency (secondary unresponsiveness, particularly during trauma, surgery, or illness), protein catabolism, sodium retention, weight gain\n【37】 Gastrointestinal: Abdominal distention, gastrointestinal perforation (small and large intestine, particularly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease), hiccups, impaired intestinal carbohydrate absorption, increased appetite, nausea, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer (with possible perforation and hemorrhage), ulcerative esophagitis\n【38】 Genitourinary: Asthenospermia, oligospermia\n【39】 Hematologic & oncologic: Leukocytosis, petechia\n【40】 Hepatic: Hepatomegaly, increased liver enzymes (usually reversible on discontinuation)\n【41】 Hypersensitivity: Anaphylaxis, angioedema, hypersensitivity reaction, nonimmune anaphylaxis\n【42】 Infection: Increased susceptibility to infection, sterile abscess\n【43】 Local: Atrophy at injection site (cutaneous and subcutaneous), post-injection flare (intra-articular use), skin edema\n【44】 Nervous system: Depression, emotional lability, euphoria, headache, increased intracranial pressure (with pseudotumor cerebri; usually following discontinuation), insomnia, malaise, myasthenia, neuritis, neuropathy, paresthesia, personality changes, psychic disorder, seizure, tingling of skin (especially in the perineal area after IV injection), vertigo\n【45】 Neuromuscular & skeletal: Amyotrophy, aseptic necrosis of femoral head, aseptic necrosis of humeral head, Charcot arthropathy, osteoporosis, pathological fracture (long bones), rupture of tendon (particularly rupture of Achilles tendon), steroid myopathy, vertebral compression fracture\n【46】 Ophthalmic: Blindness (rare, periocular injection), exophthalmos, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, retinopathy (central serous chorioretinopathy), subcapsular posterior cataract\n【47】 Respiratory: Pulmonary edema\n【48】 Miscellaneous: Wound healing impairment\n【49】 Contraindications\n【50】 Hypersensitivity to hydrocortisone or any component of the formulation; systemic fungal infections; use in premature infants (formulations containing benzyl alcohol only); idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (IM administration only); intrathecal administration; live or live, attenuated virus vaccines (with immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids).\n【51】 Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.\n【52】 Warnings/Precautions\n【53】 Adrenal suppression: May cause hypercortisolism or suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, particularly in younger children or in patients receiving high doses for prolonged periods. HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis. Withdrawal and discontinuation of a corticosteroid should be done slowly and carefully. Particular care is required when patients are transferred from systemic corticosteroids to inhaled products due to possible adrenal insufficiency or withdrawal from steroids, including an increase in allergic symptoms. Patients receiving >20 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent) may be most susceptible. Fatalities have occurred due to adrenal insufficiency in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to aerosol steroids; aerosol steroids do not provide the systemic steroid needed to treat patients having trauma, surgery, or infections.\n【54】 Anaphylactoid reactions: Rare cases of anaphylactoid reactions have been observed in patients receiving corticosteroids.\n【55】 Dermal changes: Avoid injection or leakage into the dermis; dermal and/or subdermal skin depression may occur at the site of injection. Avoid deltoid muscle injection; subcutaneous atrophy may occur.\n【56】 Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to killed or inactivated vaccines. Exposure to chickenpox or measles should be avoided. Corticosteroids should not be used for cerebral malaria, fungal infections, or viral hepatitis. Close observation is required in patients with tuberculosis (TB) infection (latent TB) and/or TB reactivity; restrict use in TB disease (active TB) (only fulminating or disseminated TB in conjunction with antituberculosis treatment). Latent or active amebiasis should be ruled out in any patient with recent travel to tropical climates or unexplained diarrhea prior to corticosteroid initiation. Use with extreme caution in patients with Strongyloides infections; hyperinfection, dissemination and fatalities have occurred.\n【57】 Kaposi sarcoma: Prolonged treatment with corticosteroids has been associated with the development of Kaposi sarcoma (case reports); if noted, discontinuation of therapy should be considered (Goedert 2002).\n【58】 Myopathy: Acute myopathy has been reported with high dose corticosteroids, usually in patients with neuromuscular transmission disorders; may involve ocular and/or respiratory muscles; monitor creatine kinase; recovery may be delayed.\n【59】 Psychiatric disturbances: Corticosteroid use may cause psychiatric disturbances, including euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, severe depression, or psychotic manifestations. Symptoms usually occur within a few days or weeks of initiation of treatment and usually resolve with dose reduction or discontinuation; monitor for signs and symptoms of behavioral or mood changes. Preexisting psychiatric conditions may be exacerbated by corticosteroid use.\n【60】 Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with HF and/or hypertension; use has been associated with fluid retention, electrolyte disturbances, and hypertension. Use with caution following acute MI; corticosteroids have been associated with myocardial rupture.\n【61】 Diabetes: Use corticosteroids with caution in patients with diabetes mellitus; may alter glucose production/regulation leading to hyperglycemia.\n【62】 GI disease: Use with caution in patients with GI diseases (diverticulitis, fresh intestinal anastomoses, active or latent peptic ulcer, ulcerative colitis, abscess or other pyogenic infection) due to perforation risk; risk may be increased with concurrent use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\n【63】 Head injury: Increased mortality was observed in patients receiving high-dose IV methylprednisolone; high-dose corticosteroids should not be used for the management of head injury.\n【64】 Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment, including cirrhosis; long-term use has been associated with fluid retention.\n【65】 Kidney impairment: Use with caution in patients with kidney impairment; fluid retention may occur.\n【66】 Myasthenia gravis: Use may cause transient worsening of myasthenia gravis (MG) (eg, within first 2 weeks of treatment); monitor for worsening MG (AAN [Narayanaswami 2021]).\n【67】 Ocular disease: Use with caution in patients with cataracts and/or glaucoma; increased intraocular pressure, open-angle glaucoma, and cataracts have occurred with prolonged use. Oral steroid treatment is not recommended for the treatment of acute optic neuritis; may increase frequency of new episodes and does not affect short- or long-term visual outcomes. Use with caution in patients with ocular herpes simplex; corneal perforation may occur; do not use in active ocular herpes simplex. Consider routine eye exams in chronic users.\n【68】 Osteoporosis: Use with caution in patients with osteoporosis; high doses and/or long-term use of corticosteroids have been associated with increased bone loss and osteoporotic fractures.\n【69】 Pheochromocytoma: Pheochromocytoma crisis has been reported with corticosteroids (may be fatal). Consider the risk of pheochromocytoma crisis prior to administering corticosteroids in patients with suspected pheochromocytoma.\n【70】 Seizure disorders: Use corticosteroids with caution in patients with a history of seizure disorder; seizures have been reported with adrenal crisis.\n【71】 Septic shock or sepsis syndrome: Corticosteroids should not be administered for the treatment of sepsis in the absence of shock (SCCM/ESICM [Annane 2017]).\n【72】 Systemic sclerosis: Use with caution in patients with systemic sclerosis; an increase in scleroderma kidney crisis incidence has been observed with corticosteroid use. Monitor BP and kidney function in patients with systemic sclerosis treated with corticosteroids (EULAR [Kowal-Bielecka 2017]).\n【73】 Thyroid disease: Changes in thyroid status may necessitate dosage adjustments; metabolic clearance of corticosteroids increases in patients with hyperthyroidism and decreases in patients with hypothyroidism.\n【74】 Older adults: Use with caution in the older adult with the smallest possible effective dose for the shortest duration.\n【75】 Pediatric: May affect growth velocity; growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.\n【76】 Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Diluent for injection may contain benzyl alcohol and some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (\"gasping syndrome\") in neonates; the \"gasping syndrome\" consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension and cardiovascular collapse (AAP [\"Inactive\" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol and/or benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates. See manufacturer's labeling.\n【77】 Capsule: Sprinkles are therapeutically equivalent to tablets; however, compounding tablets into a suspension, or crushing or splitting tablets could lead to a relative difference in exposure on the same nominal dose leading to symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Dosage adjustments of oral sprinkles may be needed if adrenal insufficiency occurs.\n【78】 Discontinuation of therapy: Withdraw therapy with gradual tapering of dose.\n【79】 Epidural injection: Corticosteroids are not approved for epidural injection. Serious neurologic events (eg, spinal cord infarction, paraplegia, quadriplegia, cortical blindness, stroke), some resulting in death, have been reported with epidural injection of corticosteroids, with and without use of fluoroscopy.\n【80】 Stress: Patients may require higher doses when subject to stress (ie, trauma, surgery, severe infection).\n【81】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【82】 May cause osteoporosis (at any age) or inhibition of bone growth in pediatric patients. Use with caution in patients with osteoporosis. In a population-based study of children, risk of fracture was shown to be increased with >4 courses of corticosteroids; underlying clinical condition may also impact bone health and osteoporotic effect of corticosteroids (Leonard 2007). In premature neonates, reports of gastrointestinal perforation in the hydrocortisone treatment arm have resulted in the closure of two large bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) clinical trials (Peltoniemi 2005; Watterberg 2004); concomitant use with indomethacin or ibuprofen may increase the risk and should be avoided in this population (Seri 2006). Increased IOP may occur especially with prolonged use; in children, increased IOP has been shown to be dose dependent and produce a greater IOP in children <6 years than older children treated with ophthalmic dexamethasone (Lam 2005). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been reported in premature neonates.\n【83】 In premature neonates, the use of high-dose dexamethasone (approximately >0.5 mg/kg/day) for the prevention or treatment of BPD has been associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, including higher rates of cerebral palsy without additional clinical benefit over lower doses; current data does not support use of high doses. Data specific to hydrocortisone use in this population has shown that use <7 days of therapy does not appear to be associated with adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (Needelman 2010). Early initiation (ie, PNA <24 hours) of low-dose hydrocortisone for BPD prevention was shown to improve survival without BPD in neonates born at GA <28 weeks and was not associated with a statistically significant difference in neurodevelopment at 2 years corrected age compared to placebo; a secondary analysis looking at neurodevelopment according to gestation showed a statistically significant improvement in neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonates at 24 to 25 weeks gestation receiving hydrocortisone; the incidence of moderate to severe neurodevelopmental impairment was 2% in this group compared to 18% in the placebo group; no differences in neurodevelopmental outcomes were . Similar to early initiation, when hydrocortisone was initiated later (ie, PNA 14 to 28 days) in neonates born at <30 weeks gestation, no adverse neurodevelopmental effects were .\n【84】 Dosage Forms: US\n【85】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【86】 Capsule Sprinkle, Oral:\n【87】 Alkindi Sprinkle: 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 5 mg\n【88】 Solution Reconstituted, Injection, as sodium succinate [strength expressed as base, preservative free]:\n【89】 Solu-CORTEF: 100 mg (1 ea); 250 mg (1 ea); 500 mg (1 ea); 1000 mg (1 ea)\n【90】 Tablet, Oral, as base:\n【91】 Cortef: 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg [scored]\n【92】 Generic: 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg\n【93】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【94】 May be product dependent\n【95】 Pricing: US\n【96】 0.5 mg (per each): $9.60\n【97】 1 mg (per each): $19.20\n【98】 2 mg (per each): $38.39\n【99】 5 mg (per each): $95.98\n【100】 100 mg (per each): $23.32\n【101】 250 mg (per each): $43.14\n【102】 500 mg (per each): $86.32\n【103】 1000 mg (per each): $172.60\n【104】 5 mg (per each): $1.21\n【105】 10 mg (per each): $2.04\n【106】 20 mg (per each): $3.86\n【107】 5 mg (per each): $0.34 - $1.02\n【108】 10 mg (per each): $0.57 - $2.15\n【109】 20 mg (per each): $1.09 - $3.26\n【110】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【111】 Solution Reconstituted, Injection, as sodium succinate [strength expressed as base]:\n【112】 Cortef: 10 mg, 20 mg [contains corn starch]\n【113】 Generic: 10 mg, 20 mg\n【114】 Administration: Adult\n【115】 Administration: Pediatric\n【116】 Oral: Administer with food or milk to decrease GI upset; for physiologic replacement in pediatric patients, higher doses are typically administered in the morning and midday with lower doses in the evening to replicate diurnal variation; early evening doses (18:00) may be necessary in some children (doses too close to bedtime can interfere with sleep) (Ref).\n【117】 Sprinkles (Alkindi): Do not swallow capsule whole. Hold capsule so numeric strength section of the capsule is at the top and tap capsule to ensure all granules in lower section, then open the capsule by squeezing the bottom section and twisting the top off. Granules may be administered by any of the following methods: Pouring granules directly onto patient's tongue; pouring granules onto a spoon and placing in patient's mouth; or sprinkling granules onto a spoon containing a soft food (eg, yogurt, fruit puree) that is cold or at room temperature and then having patient consume preferably within 5 minutes to avoid bitter taste. Avoid getting capsule wet (if capsule is wet, granules may stick and not get delivered in dose). Do not crush or chew granules. Ingest fluids (eg, water, milk, breast milk, infant formula) after dose is administered to ensure all granules swallowed. Do not add granules directly to a liquid; may result in reduced dose delivered as well as a bitter taste. Do not administer through NG or gastric tubes; granules will clog tube.\n【118】 Parenteral: Hydrocortisone sodium succinate may be administered by IM or IV routes.

Specifically, the risk of vaccine-associated infection may be increased. Corticosteroids (Systemic) may diminish the therapeutic effect of Yellow Fever Vaccine.  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【223】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【224】 Some studies have shown an association between first trimester systemic corticosteroid use and oral clefts or decreased birth weight; however, information is conflicting and may be influenced by maternal dose/indication for use (Lunghi 2010; Park-Wyllie 2000; Pradat 2003). Hypoadrenalism may occur in newborns following maternal use of corticosteroids in pregnancy; monitor.\n【225】 When treating patients with adrenal insufficiency (primary or central or congenital adrenal hyperplasia) during pregnancy, hydrocortisone is the preferred corticosteroid. Doses may need to be adjusted as pregnancy progresses. Pregnant patients with adrenal insufficiency should be monitored at least once each trimester (ES [Bornstein 2016]; ES [Fleseriu 2016]; ES [Speiser 2018]).\n【226】 High doses of hydrocortisone (ie, stress doses) may be required to prevent adrenal crisis during labor in patients with known or suspected adrenal insufficiency (eg, Cushingoid appearance, prolonged glucocorticoid therapy) (ES [Bornstein 2016]; ES [Fleseriu 2016]; ES [Speiser 2018]; ESE [Luger 2021]). Patients who require systemic corticosteroids for management of asthma should also be given IV corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, during labor and for 24 hours after delivery to prevent adrenal crisis (ACOG [Dombrowski 2008]; ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]). Patients using chronic low dose steroids for rheumatic disorders generally do not need a stress dose of hydrocortisone at the time of vaginal delivery; however, stress dosing may be needed in women with multiple comorbidities treated with chronic high dose steroid therapy. Stress dosing is recommended prior to cesarean delivery (ACR [Sammaritano 2020]).\n【227】 Uncontrolled asthma is associated with adverse events on pregnancy (increased risk of perinatal mortality, preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight infants, cesarean delivery, and the development of gestational diabetes). Poorly controlled asthma or asthma exacerbations may have a greater fetal/maternal risk than what is associated with appropriately used asthma medications. Maternal treatment improves pregnancy outcomes by reducing the risk of some adverse events (eg, preterm birth, gestational diabetes). Maternal asthma symptoms should be monitored monthly during pregnancy. Inhaled corticosteroids are recommended for the treatment of asthma during pregnancy; however, systemic corticosteroids should be used to control acute exacerbations or treat severe persistent asthma. Hydrocortisone may be used when parenteral administration is required (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]; GINA 2022).\n【228】 Hydrocortisone is approved for the treatment of rheumatic disorders, however, when systemic corticosteroids are needed in pregnancy, nonfluorinated corticosteroids (eg, prednisone) are preferred (ACR [Sammaritano 2020]).\n【229】 For dermatologic disorders in pregnant patients, systemic corticosteroids are generally not preferred for initial therapy; should be avoided during the first trimester; and used during the second or third trimester at the lowest effective dose (Leachman 2006).\n【230】 In nonpregnant patients, hydrocortisone is recommended off label as an alternative corticosteroid for the management of COVID-19 (NIH 2023). In general, the treatment of COVID-19 during pregnancy is the same as in nonpregnant patients. However, because data for most therapeutic agents in pregnant patients are limited, treatment options should be evaluated as part of a shared decision-making process. Hydrocortisone is also an alternative for use in pregnant patients with severe or critical COVID-19 due to limited placental transfer. Suggested treatment algorithms are available for pregnant patients with severe or critical COVID-19 requiring corticosteroids (Saad 2020; Teelucksingh 2022). The risk of severe illness from COVID-19 infection is increased in symptomatic pregnant patients compared to nonpregnant patients (ACOG 2023). Information related to the treatment of COVID-19 during pregnancy continues to emerge; refer to current guidelines for the treatment of pregnant patients.\n【231】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【232】 Corticosteroids are present in breast milk.\n【233】 The manufacturer notes that when used systemically, maternal use of corticosteroids have the potential to cause adverse events in a breastfed infant (eg, growth suppression, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production).\n【234】 Single doses of hydrocortisone are considered acceptable for use in breastfeeding patients; data is not available following prolonged use. Corticosteroids are generally considered acceptable in breastfeeding patients when used in usual doses; however, monitoring of the infant is recommended (WHO 2002).\n【235】 If there is concern about exposure to the infant, some guidelines recommend waiting 4 hours after the maternal dose of an oral systemic corticosteroid before breastfeeding in order to decrease potential exposure to the breastfed infant (based on a study using prednisolone) (ACR [Sammaritano 2020]; Butler 2014; ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]; Leachman 2006; Ost 1985).\n【236】 Dietary Considerations\n【237】 Systemic use of corticosteroids may require a diet with increased potassium, vitamins A, B6, C, D, folate, calcium, zinc, phosphorus, and decreased sodium. Some products may contain sodium.\n【238】 Monitoring Parameters\n【239】 Serum glucose, electrolytes; BP, weight, presence of infection; monitor IOP with therapy >6 weeks; bone mineral density; assess HPA axis suppression (eg, ACTH stimulation test, morning plasma cortisol test, urinary free cortisol test); signs and symptoms of behavioral or mood changes; signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome every 6 months (pediatric patients <1 year of age may require monitoring every 3 to 4 months); growth in pediatric patients.\n【240】 Mechanism of Action\n【241】 Short-acting corticosteroid with minimal sodium-retaining potential; decreases inflammation by suppression of migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reversal of increased capillary permeability\n【242】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【243】 Onset of action: IV: 1 hour.\n【244】 Absorption: Rapid.\n【245】 Bioavailability: Oral: 96% ± 20% (Czock 2005); oral sprinkles: ~87%.\n【246】 Distribution: Vd: IV: 27 ± 7 L (Czock 2005).\n【247】 Protein binding: IV: 92% ± 2% (Czock 2005); oral sprinkles: ≥90%.\n【248】 Metabolism: Hepatic.\n【249】 Half-life elimination: IM: 2.2 ± 1.5 hours (Hahner 2013); IV: 2 ± 0.3 hours; Oral: 1.8 ± 0.5 hours (Czock 2005); SubQ: 4.7 ± 4.7 hours (Hahner 2013).\n【250】 Time to peak, plasma: IM: 66 ± 51 minutes (Hahner 2013); Oral: 1.2 ± 0.4 hours (Czock 2005); SubQ: 91 ± 34 minutes (Hahner 2013).\n【251】 Excretion: Urine (Czock 2005).\n【252】 Brand Names: International\n【253】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Hydrocortisone (systemic)  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/hydrocortisone-systemic-drug-information?search=%E5%A4%B4%E4%BD%8D%E9%A1%BA%E4%BA%A7&source=search_result&selectedTitle=135%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 01:28:08"}

The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of chikungunya infection are discussed separately.   \"Chikungunya fever: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\".)\n【2】 Issues related to other viral causes of arthritis are also presented separately.   \"Viruses that cause arthritis\".)\n【3】 Following the acute phase, most patients who remain symptomatic have joint disease; chronic joint disease may benefit from medications commonly employed in other forms of chronic inflammatory arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), including disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).  'Post-acute and chronic arthritis' below.)\n【4】 Inflammatory arthritis evident on physical examination and chronic arthralgia without physical findings are treated similarly; the latter is also presumed to be due to ongoing inflammatory synovitis, although this is based upon limited evidence.\n【5】 Most descriptions of disease and their sequelae rely upon data from large outbreaks. Persistent and sometimes severe polyarthralgia is the most prominent feature, often without objective signs of inflammation on examination, such as swelling and erythema. These patients typically have prolonged morning stiffness and may respond to conventional DMARDs, suggesting that post-infectious, inflammatory arthritis may be the underlying cause.\n【6】 Moreover, a few ultrasound studies have demonstrated inflammatory synovitis during the acute phase of infection , as well as in patients with both post-acute and chronic joint pain . However, studies of these populations with synovial fluid analysis or histology are lacking, as are studies that explore whether acute arthritis should be treated differently than chronic arthralgia and chronic arthritis.   \"Chikungunya fever: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical manifestations'.)\n【7】 The acute illness typically lasts approximately 7 to 10 days, but acute disease requiring treatment may persist up to a month. In patients with clinical manifestations of acute chikungunya infection (eg, acute pain, fever, and arthralgia), we suggest acetaminophen (paracetamol; up to 500 to 1000 mg three times daily) or, once dengue is excluded and if acetaminophen is inadequate for symptom relief, NSAIDs (eg, naproxen 375 to 500 mg twice daily, ibuprofen 400 to 800 mg three times daily, or another NSAID); any NSAID may be used.\n【8】 Typically, an NSAID should be tried for two weeks, and if it is ineffective, patients should be switched to a different NSAID. Both acetaminophen and NSAIDs should be used in the lowest dose and for the shortest duration necessary and avoided in patients with contraindications including known liver disease or elevated aminotransferases. There is no evidence that any one NSAID is superior to another or that in chikungunya infection, any specific NSAIDs should be avoided. Contraindications to NSAIDs and adverse effects of these agents (including renal, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular disease) are discussed in detail separately.   \"Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects\" and  \"Overview of COX-2 selective NSAIDs\", section on 'Toxicities and possible toxicities'.)\n【9】 In a patient who could have dengue virus infection, aspirin and other NSAIDs should not be used until dengue has been excluded or until 14 days after symptom onset, with the patient afebrile ≥48 hours and no warning signs for severe dengue (severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, mucosal bleeding, pleural effusion or ascites, lethargy, enlarged liver, and increased hematocrit with decrease in platelet count). This is important given the risk of bleeding complications associated with dengue infection, which could be worsened by aspirin or other NSAIDs, and because of the potential risk of Reye syndrome in children treated with salicylates. Coinfection with dengue and chikungunya viruses can occur, so acute dengue infection needs to be excluded even if diagnosis of chikungunya infection is confirmed. The diagnosis of dengue fever, chikungunya fever, and related diagnoses are described separately.   \"Dengue virus infection: Prevention and treatment\" and  \"Chikungunya fever: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Diagnosis' and  \"Chikungunya fever: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Differential diagnosis'.)\n【10】 In patients with acute disease and severe pain who are unable to take acetaminophen and NSAIDs, or who do not respond adequately to these agents, we selectively use opioid analgesics (eg, tramadol or oxycodone) in the lowest dose for the shortest duration necessary.\n【11】 In general, systemic glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive medications should be avoided during acute infection. The safety of immunosuppression during acute infection is not well established, and there is concern that use of these agents may exacerbate the infection, especially during the viremic phase, which lasts approximately nine days .   \"Chikungunya fever: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Acute infection'.)\n【12】 In patients with acute chikungunya fever, the rash resolves spontaneously and does not require treatment.\n【13】 Most patients experience improvement in their symptoms within a month, regardless of therapy. Hospitalization is required infrequently, typically in infants, older adults, or immunocompromised patients with organ-threatening disease or severe complications related to an underlying medical condition.\n【14】 Our treatment approach is based upon reports from case series , our clinical experience, and recommendations from expert groups . There are only a few randomized trials; they have a number of limitations . As examples:\n【15】 Treatment with daily NSAIDs and glucocorticoids (beginning in the second week of acute illness) has been associated with some symptomatic benefit during the first six weeks of illness. In one trial involving 120 patients with acute chikungunya fever and arthritis, patients randomly assigned to treatment for six weeks with either aceclofenac (an NSAID) monotherapy (200 mg daily), aceclofenac plus hydroxychloroquine (HCQ; 400 mg daily), aceclofenac plus prednisolone (10 mg daily), or aceclofenac plus HCQ plus prednisone, all groups had showed benefit from therapy and had increased difficulty performing activities of daily living upon discontinuation of medications at week 6 . Greater pain relief was observed among the patients who received prednisolone compared with the patients who did not receive prednisolone (an approximate reduction in pain scores from baseline of 75 versus 30 to 40 percent).\n【16】 Limited evidence demonstrates no benefit of chloroquine or HCQ in patients with acute symptoms. In a randomized trial involving 54 patients, there was no improvement in acute or chronic pain or in the level of viremia in the first three days in patients receiving chloroquine compared with placebo . In this report, it was unclear whether the patients were being treated during the acute and/or subacute phase of infection. Greater pain was reported at day 200 among patients who received chloroquine.\n【17】 For patients who present with severe post-acute or chronic symptoms, it is important to confirm chikungunya virus infection by establishing that patients are seropositive (positive anti-chikungunya virus immunoglobulin G [IgG]). Furthermore, other types of arthritis must be excluded (eg, seronegative spondyloarthritis [SpA], RA, or crystalline arthritis) before attributing symptoms to chikungunya virus.   \"Chikungunya fever: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Diagnosis' and  \"Chikungunya fever: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Differential diagnosis'.)\n【18】 As in patients with acute symptoms, the minimal necessary dose and duration of medications is used. Periodically, an effort should be made to reduce and discontinue medications. Joint symptoms may gradually resolve over several months, and ongoing treatment may no longer be required.\n【19】 In patients whose symptoms are refractory to two to three two-week courses of different NSAIDs and who exhibit arthralgia or arthritis, tendinitis, or bursitis, especially those with evidence of severe synovitis and joint swelling and persistent elevation of inflammatory markers, we suggest systemic glucocorticoids (prednisone 10 to 20 mg daily for five days, depending upon severity, tapered over 10 days). We give the lowest effective glucocorticoid dose possible with a short trial, which is sometimes sufficient; however, the individual response to therapy varies substantially; more severely affected patients may require higher doses (0.5 mg/kg daily) , and some patients require up to one to two months of glucocorticoid therapy . One expert guideline suggests limiting glucocorticoids when possible to no more than four weeks of therapy .\n【20】 Intraarticular glucocorticoids are rarely, if ever, indicated because the usual pattern of joint involvement is polyarticular, with involvement of multiple small and large joints, and because there is no evidence to support the efficacy of this approach.\n【21】 Additional analgesic benefit may be provided by use of medications for neuropathic pain (eg, pregabalin or gabapentin)   \"Pharmacologic management of chronic non-cancer pain in adults\", section on 'Antiseizure medications'). Physical therapy may also be helpful.\n【22】 The approach to patients who develop Raynaud phenomenon is the same as in other patients with this disorder.   \"Treatment of Raynaud phenomenon: Initial management\".)\n【23】 Our treatment approach is based upon reports from case series, our clinical experience, and recommendations from expert groups . Randomized trials are lacking or have limitations and limited applicability .\n【24】 In patients with chronic arthritis not controlled by NSAIDs or prednisone 5 to 7.5 mg daily (or equivalent), we suggest a conventional DMARD, usually MTX; SSZ or an alternative DMARD are other options, as described below. For patients on NSAIDs or glucocorticoids, periodic attempts (eg, monthly) should be made to taper therapy, given the natural history of gradual improvement over months in chronic chikungunya arthritis. Similarly, we discontinue MTX (or other DMARDs) within several months after patients respond.   \"Chikungunya fever: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis\", section on 'Chronic arthritis and arthralgia' and  \"Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids\".)\n【25】 Limited evidence suggests that MTX is the best available DMARD for patients with chronic chikungunya arthritis:\n【26】 Chronic peripheral arthritis – In most patients with chronic peripheral arthritis, especially that which resembles RA, who require ongoing therapy for symptomatic control, we suggest MTX, using the approach described in detail separately for patients with RA   \"Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults\" and  \"Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis\"). The adverse effects of MTX are described separately as well.   \"Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate\".)\n【27】 The dosing and absorption of MTX should be optimized, as in RA, by use of parenteral therapy or split oral doses (two doses 8 to 12 hours apart once weekly) in patients who do not respond to more than 15 mg once weekly by mouth.   \"Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis\", section on 'Alternatives to once-weekly oral therapy'.)\n【28】 Alternatives to MTX in patients unable to take the drug include SSZ, as well as other conventional DMARDs, but there is little evidence to support the use of conventional DMARDs other than MTX and SSZ. Several studies suggest that HCQ is ineffective .   \"Alternatives to methotrexate for the initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults\".)\n【29】 Chronic axial spondyloarthritis pattern – In patients with disease of the axial spine, in whom MTX may not be effective, we suggest a TNF inhibitor, using the approach described in detail separately for patients with axial SpA   \"Treatment of axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in adults\", section on 'Inadequate response to NSAIDs'). This approach is based upon clinical experience and indirect evidence from the use of TNF inhibitors for the treatment of axial SpA, and patients should be closely monitored given the very limited safety data for the use of biologic DMARDs in the setting of this viral infection. Available information regarding the adverse effects of TNF inhibitor therapy is described in detail separately.   \"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors: An overview of adverse effects\".)\n【30】 Our treatment approach is based upon the available case series  and expert opinion , but there are no well-designed randomized trials comparing DMARDs for this condition. Evidence is also lacking as to whether any therapy protects against joint injury. In spite of these limitations  and given the risks of chronic glucocorticoids, the available reports suggest that MTX is warranted in patients with chronic polyarthritis ; well-designed randomized trials are needed to compare MTX with other agents.\n【31】 Few DMARD randomized trials have been performed in patients with chronic arthritis . As examples of the available evidence:\n【32】 In one of the largest retrospective observational studies involving 159 patients, 72 were treated with MTX 15 mg weekly, with a positive therapeutic response (no need for dose escalation or a switch in therapy). These results were achieved in patients with chronic RA, SpA, and undifferentiated polyarthritis disease patterns (67, 80, and 100 percent of patients, respectively) .\n【33】 In a randomized trial involving 72 patients with active arthritis for greater than a year despite treatment with HCQ, triple therapy with MTX (15 mg once weekly), SSZ (1 gram daily), and HCQ (400 mg daily) was more effective than HCQ alone. Patients assigned to triple therapy experienced greater pain relief (mean pain visual analog scale [VAS] 46 versus 61), less disease activity (Disease Activity Score-28 with Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate [DAS28-ESR] 3.39 versus 4.74), and less disability (mean Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] score 1.4 versus 1.9) after six months of such therapy, compared with those on HCQ monotherapy . Patients were also treated during the trial with prednisolone (initially 7.5 mg daily and tapered off over six weeks) and acetaminophen or NSAIDs as needed.\n【34】 Small trials using antimalarials, either chloroquine or HCQ, for post-acute or chronic arthritis have not shown benefit and have limitations in study or trial design.\n【35】 Resistant to MTX – Patients resistant to MTX monotherapy could be treated with combination therapy with other conventional DMARDs  or with an alternative conventional DMARD, such as SSZ or leflunomide. We do not use HCQ monotherapy. For patients in whom conventional DMARDs are ineffective, one expert group recommends a TNF inhibitor, among the biologic DMARDs, although the safety of biologic therapy has not been established in these patients .   \"Alternatives to methotrexate for the initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults\".)\n【36】 Resistant to SSZ – In patients with chronic polyarthritis (RA-like disease) that is resistant to SSZ, MTX would be a preferred option  'Initial therapy of chronic arthritis' above). In patients with SpA-like disease, MTX would be an option if no significant axial involvement is present, but a TNF inhibitor would be preferred in patients with symptomatic axial involvement. Biologic agents should be used with caution in patients with chikungunya infection.\n【37】 In one small case series, patients with pre-existing inflammatory rheumatic diseases on nonbiologic and biologic DMARDs, including TNF inhibitors, were managed effectively with NSAIDs and rest; in spite of DMARD therapy, they experienced a normal course of chikungunya infection without exacerbation of their pre-existing rheumatic disease .\n【38】 Individuals with chikungunya infection may reduce spread of infection to others by following precautions to avoid mosquito bites during the first week of illness (the likely period of viremia).\n【39】 In a double-blind, randomized trial of a live-attenuated chikungunya virus vaccine (VLA1553) in the United States, 4128 healthy adults (age ≥18 years) were randomly assigned to a single dose of vaccine or placebo . Among the 266 patients who were assessed for immunogenicity, a seroprotective neutralizing antibody response occurred in 99 percent by 28 days after vaccination and persisted in 96 percent at 180 days. None of the placebo recipients developed a neutralizing antibody response. Response rates were similar among participants aged 18 to 64 years and those 65 years and older. Two serious adverse effects were attributed to the vaccine (myalgia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), both of which resolved. The most common adverse effects reported by all trial participants receiving the vaccine included headache (32 percent), fatigue (29 percent), myalgia (24 percent), arthralgia (18 percent), and fever (14 percent). Ongoing studies include assessing immunogenicity over five years and a double-blind, randomized trial among adolescents aged 12 to 18 in Brazil.\n【40】 In a randomized trial including more than 260 healthy adults in non-chikungunya-endemic regions, a live-attenuated, measles-vectored vaccine expressing chikungunya virus structural proteins (MV-CHIK), or a measles vaccine prime and MV-CHIK, induced neutralizing antibodies against chikungunya virus after one or two immunizations . Seroconversion rates in those who received MV-CHIK ranged from 50 to 93 percent after one dose and 86 to 100 percent after a two doses. Immune responses were durable up to six months after one or two doses and the vaccine was safe and well-tolerated. Additional clinical trials are ongoing.\n【41】 In a randomized phase 2 trial of a CHIK virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine, 400 adults in chikungunya-endemic Caribbean countries received two intramuscular injections or placebo. Among those who were seronegative at baseline, 88 percent had at least a fourfold increase from baseline neutralization titers . The immune response was durable up to 72 weeks after vaccination, and the vaccine was safe and well-tolerated. Two phase 3 clinical trials evaluating an adjuvanted form of this vaccine (PXVX0317) are in progress .\n【42】 A messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccine (VLA-181388) is in phase 1 clinical trials .\n【43】 Further studies are needed for all chikungunya vaccine candidates focusing on vaccine efficacy, cross-protection against multiple chikungunya virus strains, duration of immunity, and safety and efficacy in other populations, such as children.\n【44】 Supportive care – There is no specific antiviral therapy for treatment of chikungunya virus infection, and management during the acute phase is supportive, including rest, fluids, and antiinflammatory and analgesic agents  'Acute disease' above):\n【45】 Refractory arthritis – For patients not responsive to two to three two-week courses of NSAIDs who exhibit musculoskeletal symptoms, particularly patients with severe synovitis, joint swelling, or persistent elevation of inflammatory markers, we suggest systemic glucocorticoids (Grade 2C). A typical initial dose is prednisone 10 to 20 mg daily for five days, depending upon severity, then tapered off over the next 10 days. More severely affected patients may require higher doses (eg, prednisone 0.5 mg/kg daily), and some patients require up to one to two months of glucocorticoid therapy. We use the lowest effective dose possible.  'Post-acute arthritis' above.)\n【46】 Chronic arthritis – For patients with chronic arthritis (>3 months after initial infection) who are unable to taper prednisone without recurrence of symptoms, we suggest treatment with a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD; eg, methotrexate [MTX], or if MTX is contraindicated, sulfasalazine [SSZ]), rather than continuing glucocorticoids alone (Grade 2C). The choice of DMARD may be guided by the pattern of joint involvement. We generally use the same approach to dosing and monitoring these medications as in RA but make an effort to taper medications after four to six months once patients have been asymptomatic for at least six months.  'Chronic arthritis' above.)\n【47】 Prevention – Minimizing mosquito exposure is the cornerstone of prevention. Individuals with chikungunya infection may reduce spread of infection to others by following precautions to avoid mosquito bites during the first week of illness (the likely window of viremia). Development of a vaccine for prevention of chikungunya virus infection is ongoing.

We consider this to be acute simple cystitis. When there is concern that the infection has possibly extended beyond the bladder (eg, when there is flank pain or other features suggestive of pyelonephritis, pelvic or perineal pain, fever, and/or other signs of systemic illness, including sepsis) we consider this to be a complicated UTI. This approach to categorizing UTI  differs from other conventions, as discussed in detail below.\n【2】 Our approach to complicated UTI is discussed elsewhere.   \"Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults\".)\n【3】 In males, cystitis can occur in the setting of prostatitis; this is discussed elsewhere.   \"Acute bacterial prostatitis\" and  \"Chronic bacterial prostatitis\".)\n【4】 Acute simple cystitis in females and UTIs in special populations are discussed elsewhere:\n【5】 Asymptomatic bacteriuria is also discussed in detail elsewhere.   \"Asymptomatic bacteriuria in adults\".)\n【6】 UTI in children is also discussed separately.\n【7】 If any of these signs or symptoms are present in the setting of pyuria and bacteriuria, we consider the patient to have acute complicated UTI and manage the patient differently. By this definition, pyelonephritis is a complicated UTI, regardless of patient characteristics.   \"Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults\".)\n【8】 We do not automatically consider patients with underlying urologic abnormalities (such as nephrolithiasis, strictures, stents, or urinary diversions), immunocompromising conditions (such as neutropenia or advanced HIV infection), or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus to have a complicated UTI if they have no concerning symptoms for upper tract or systemic infection. However, such patients can be at higher risk for more serious infection and have not traditionally been included in studies evaluating the antibiotic regimens we typically use for acute simple cystitis. Thus, we follow such patients more closely and/or have a low threshold to manage them as complicated UTI (eg, if they have subtle signs or symptoms that could be suggestive of more extensive infection). Many patients with significant urologic abnormalities come to clinical attention for UTI because of signs or symptoms consistent with complicated UTI as defined here (rather than features of simple cystitis alone).\n【9】 Other populations, such as renal transplant recipients, have unique management considerations and thus are not included in the above categorization. These populations are discussed elsewhere.   \"Urinary tract infection in kidney transplant recipients\".)\n【10】 These definitions of acute simple cystitis and complicated UTI are different from other categorizations, which themselves are somewhat variable. Specifically, cystitis or pyelonephritis in a nonpregnant, premenopausal woman without underlying urologic abnormalities has traditionally been termed acute uncomplicated UTI , and complicated UTI has been defined, for the purposes of treatment trials, as cystitis or pyelonephritis in a patient with underlying urologic abnormalities. Individuals who do not fit into either category have often been treated as having a complicated UTI by default. It has also been conventional to consider all UTIs in males as complicated, since the majority occur in infants or in older adults in association with urologic abnormalities, such as bladder outlet obstruction (eg, due to prostatic hyperplasia) or instrumentation. In addition, it is not always possible to rule out prostate infection. However, we favor an approach to treatment based on the extent of infection and severity of illness. Since complicated UTI, as defined here, is a more serious infection than simple cystitis, the efficacy of an antimicrobial agent is of greater importance, and certain agents used for simple cystitis should not be used for complicated UTI because they do not achieve adequate levels in tissue, which may be important for cure. Risk for infection with drug-resistant organisms is a consideration in antibiotic selection for both simple cystitis and acute complicated UTI.\n【11】 Symptomatic UTI is much less common in males than in females. This is due to longer urethral length, drier periurethral environment (with less frequent colonization around the urethra), and antibacterial substances in prostatic fluid.\n【12】 Risk factors associated with acute simple cystitis in males include insertive anal intercourse and lack of circumcision .\n【13】 Prostatitis should be considered in males presenting with cystitis symptoms that are recurrent or are accompanied by pelvic or perineal pain or fever.   \"Acute bacterial prostatitis\" and  \"Chronic bacterial prostatitis\".)\n【14】 Fever, chills, rigors, and other signs of systemic illness are not compatible with a diagnosis of acute simple cystitis and raise the possibility of pyelonephritis, prostatitis, or other complication of UTI.   \"Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults\" and  \"Acute bacterial prostatitis\".)\n【15】 Laboratory diagnostic tools consist of urinalysis (either by microscopy or by dipstick) and urine culture with susceptibility data. A urine Gram stain may be helpful in guiding the choice of empiric therapy pending culture results. A urine culture should be performed in all males with symptoms suggestive of cystitis.\n【16】 The possibility of a urethritis should be considered in males who are sexually active.  'Differential diagnosis' below.)\n【17】 The most accurate method for assessing pyuria is to examine an unspun, voided midstream urine specimen with a hemocytometer; an abnormal result is ≥10 leukocytes/microL . White blood cell casts in the urine are diagnostic of upper tract infection, which would indicate a complicated UTI.\n【18】 Urinalysis is discussed further separately.   \"Sampling and evaluation of voided urine in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in adults\".)\n【19】 The spectrum of isolates causing simple cystitis in males is not well defined but is likely similar to that in females. E. coli (75 to 95 percent) is the predominant bacteria, with occasional other species of Enterobacteriaceae, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis .   \"Acute simple cystitis in females\", section on 'Microbiology'.)\n【20】 Any of these features suggest an alternative diagnosis, potentially acute bacterial prostatitis or acute complicated UTI.   \"Acute bacterial prostatitis\" and  \"Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults\".)\n【21】 We also have a lower threshold to consider patients with risk factors for more serious infection as having acute complicated UTI, for example, if they have subtle signs or symptoms of possible upper tract or systemic infection. Such risk factors include urologic abnormalities (eg, nephrolithiasis, strictures, stents, or urinary diversions), immunocompromising conditions (eg, neutropenia or advanced HIV infection), or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.\n【22】 Underlying chronic prostatitis should be considered in males with cystitis, particularly in those males who have recurrent UTIs caused by the same strain of bacteria.   \"Chronic bacterial prostatitis\".)\n【23】 Urethritis must be considered in sexually active males; evaluation and diagnosis of urethritis are discussed in detail elsewhere.   \"Urethritis in adult males\", section on 'Diagnosis'.)\n【24】 The choice among them should be individualized based on patient circumstances (allergy, tolerability, expected adherence), local community resistance prevalence, availability, and cost. If the patient has taken one of the agents in the preceding three months, a different one should be selected. Based on data on UTI in females, empiric TMP-SMX should be avoided if the regional prevalence of resistance is known to exceed 20 percent . Nitrofurantoin or fosfomycin are particularly useful if multidrug resistance is documented or suspected\n【25】 Once susceptibility testing results are available, subsequent therapy should be tailored as appropriate.\n【26】 In males with simple cystitis who have no signs or symptoms suggestive of pyelonephritis or prostatitis (eg, fever, flank pain, pelvic pain, prostatic tenderness on digital rectal exam if this part of the examination is performed), a seven-day or shorter course of an antimicrobial to which the infecting strain is susceptible is likely to be sufficient. This approach is supported by findings of a double-blind trial of 272 males who were starting ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for symptoms of a UTI (mainly dysuria, frequency, and urgency) and were randomly assigned to receive seven days of the chosen antibiotic followed by seven days of placebo or receive 14 days of the antibiotic . There was no detected difference in the rate of clinical cure 14 days following completion of the active antibiotic (93 versus 90 percent) or in the rate of recurrent symptoms within 28 days (10 versus 13 percent) with 7 versus 14 days of therapy. This trial confirmed findings of retrospective studies, which also suggested similar outcomes in clinical cure and recurrence risk with short (seven days or less) versus long (more than seven days) antimicrobial courses for males with UTI . In one database study of 573 males attending outpatient clinics, treatment for more than seven days was actually associated with a higher risk of recurrence when males with urologic abnormalities, immunocompromising conditions, prostatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, and benign prostatic hyperplasia were excluded from the analysis (odds ratio 2.62) . Longer courses of antibiotics may also be associated with a higher risk of adverse events (eg, Clostridioides difficile infection) .\n【27】 When fluoroquinolones specifically are used, a course as short as five days is likely effective. In a trial of patients with complicated UTI, five days of levofloxacin was equivalent to 10 days of ciprofloxacin .\n【28】 Patients who have worsening or persistent symptoms after 48 to 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy or have recurrent symptoms within a few weeks of treatment should have additional evaluation for other potential conditions that may be causing those symptoms and for factors that might be compromising clinical response. This includes urine culture and, potentially, empiric treatment with another antimicrobial agent.\n【29】 Males with persistent or recurrent symptoms following a course of antimicrobial therapy for cystitis also warrant evaluation for the possibility of underlying prostatitis.   \"Chronic bacterial prostatitis\", section on 'Diagnosis'.)\n【30】 Subsequent treatment should be tailored to the susceptibility profile of the causative organism isolated. If symptoms persist in the setting of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, urological evaluation or radiographic imaging (generally with computed tomography) is appropriate to evaluate for anatomic abnormalities that would interfere with response to antimicrobial treatment.\n【31】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia has also occurred.\n【94】 Cardiotoxicity: QT prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, including fatal torsades de pointes, have been reported with oxaliplatin.\n【95】 Extravasation: Oxaliplatin is an irritant with vesicant-like properties; ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion; avoid extravasation.\n【96】 Hemorrhage: GI bleeding, hematuria, and epistaxis have been reported with oxaliplatin; there have been case reports of death due to intracerebral hemorrhage. Prolonged PT and INR occasionally associated with hemorrhage have been reported in patients also receiving anticoagulants while on oxaliplatin. Thrombocytopenia and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia have been observed with oxaliplatin; immune-mediated thrombocytopenia has been associated with a rapid thrombocytopenia onset along with a greater risk of bleeding.\n【97】 Hepatotoxicity: Elevated transaminases and alkaline phosphatase have occurred with oxaliplatin. Liver biopsy has revealed peliosis, nodular regenerative hyperplasia or sinusoidal alterations, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and veno-occlusive lesions. Consider evaluating for hepatic vascular disorders in patients who develop portal hypertension or increased LFTs that cannot be explained by liver metastases.\n【98】 Hypersensitivity: Serious and fatal hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) may occur within minutes of oxaliplatin administration and during any cycle. Grade 3 or 4 hypersensitivity has been observed (rare). Allergic reactions are similar to reactions reported with other platinum analogs and may occur with any cycle. Reactions typically occur after multiple cycles; in retrospective reviews, reaction occurred at a median of 7 to 9 cycles, with an onset of 5 to 70 minutes (Kim 2009; Polyzos 2009). Symptoms may include bronchospasm (rare), erythema, hypotension (rare), pruritus, rash, and/or urticaria; previously untreated patients have also experienced flushing, diaphoresis, diarrhea, shortness of breath, chest pain, hypotension, syncope, and disorientation. According to the manufacturer, rechallenge is contraindicated (deaths due to anaphylaxis have been associated with platinum derivatives). In patients rechallenged after mild hypersensitivity, reaction recurred at a higher level of severity; for patients with severe hypersensitivity, rechallenge (with 2 to 3 days of antihistamine and corticosteroid premedication, and prolongation of infusion time) allowed for 2 to 4 additional oxaliplatin cycles; however, rechallenge was not feasible in nearly two-thirds of patients due to the severity of the initial reaction (Polyzos 2009).\n【99】 Neuropathy: Two types of peripheral sensory neuropathy may occur: The first type of neuropathy is an acute presentation (within hours to 2 days), reversible (resolves within 14 days), with primarily peripheral symptoms that are often exacerbated by cold. Symptoms may include transient paresthesia, dysesthesia, and hypoesthesia in the hands, feet, perioral area, or throat; jaw spasm, abnormal tongue sensation, pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia, dysarthria, eye pain, and a feeling of chest pressure have also been observed. Avoid mucositis prophylaxis with ice chips, exposure to cold temperatures, or consumption of cold food/beverages during or within hours after oxaliplatin infusion (may exacerbate symptoms). Acute neuropathy commonly recurs with subsequent doses. Cold-triggered neuropathy may last up to 7 days after oxaliplatin administration (Grothey 2011). The second type of neuropathy is a more persistent (>14 days) presentation that usually is characterized by paresthesia, dysesthesias, and hypoesthesias and may interfere with daily activities (eg, writing, buttoning, swallowing, difficulty walking). These symptoms may improve in some patients upon discontinuing treatment. In a retrospective evaluation of patients treated with oxaliplatin for colorectal cancer, the incidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy was similar between diabetic and nondiabetic patients (Ramanathan 2010). Several retrospective studies (as well as a small, underpowered randomized trial) have suggested calcium and magnesium infusions before and after oxaliplatin administration may reduce incidence of cumulative sensory neuropathy; however, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in patients with colorectal cancer suggests there is no benefit of calcium and magnesium in preventing sensory neuropathy or in decreasing oxaliplatin discontinuation rates (Loprinzi 2014).\n【100】 Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome have been reported (rare). Signs/symptoms include headache, mental status changes, seizure, blurred vision, blindness, and/or other vision changes; may be associated with hypertension.\n【101】 Pulmonary toxicity: Oxaliplatin is associated with pulmonary fibrosis (rare), which may be fatal. Pulmonary toxicity may present with dyspnea, cough, and/or hypoxia; grade 3 and 4 events have occurred. Eosinophilic pneumonia has been reported rarely.\n【102】 Rhabdomyolysis: Rhabdomyolysis (including fatal cases) has been reported with oxaliplatin.\n【103】 Older adult: Patients ≥65 years of age experienced a higher incidence of diarrhea and grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and may be more susceptible to dehydration, hypokalemia, leukopenia, fatigue, and syncope.\n【104】 Administration: Oxaliplatin is for IV administration. Administration via the intraperitoneal route (not an approved administration route) is associated with peritoneal hemorrhage and hemorrhagic complications (Charrier 2016).\n【105】 Dosage Forms: US\n【106】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.\n【107】 Solution, Intravenous:\n【108】 Generic: 50 mg/10 mL (10 mL); 100 mg/20 mL (20 mL)\n【109】 Solution, Intravenous [preservative free]:\n【110】 Generic: 50 mg/10 mL (10 mL); 100 mg/20 mL (20 mL); 200 mg/40 mL (40 mL)\n【111】 Solution Reconstituted, Intravenous [preservative free]:\n【112】 Generic: 50 mg (1 ea); 100 mg (1 ea)\n【113】 Generic Equivalent Available: US\n【114】 Yes\n【115】 Pricing: US\n【116】 50 mg/10 mL (per mL): $0.86 - $21.22\n【117】 100 mg/20 mL (per mL): $0.74 - $21.22\n【118】 200 mg/40 mL (per mL): $6.00\n【119】 50 mg (per each): $120.00 - $1,162.55\n【120】 100 mg (per each): $240.00 - $2,325.15\n【121】 Dosage Forms: Canada\n【122】 Generic: 5 mg/mL (10 mL, 20 mL, 30 mL, 40 mL)\n【123】 Administration: Pediatric\n【124】 Oxaliplatin is associated with a moderate emetic potential; antiemetics are recommended to prevent nausea and vomiting (Ref).\n【125】 IV: Administer as IV infusion over 2 to 6 hours.

Cold compresses could potentially precipitate or exacerbate peripheral neuropathy (Ref).\n【127】 Administration: Adult\n【128】 IV: Administer as IV infusion over 2 hours; extend infusion time to 6 hours for acute toxicities.\n【129】 Flush infusion line with D5W prior to administration of any concomitant medication. Avoid mucositis prophylaxis with ice chips, exposure to cold temperatures, or consumption of cold food/beverages during or within hours after oxaliplatin infusion (may exacerbate acute neurological symptoms). Do not use needles or administration sets containing aluminum. When used in combination with a fluoropyrimidine (eg, 5-FU), infuse oxaliplatin first.\n【130】 Oxaliplatin is associated with a moderate emetic potential and is known to cause delayed nausea and vomiting; antiemetics are recommended to prevent nausea and vomiting (Ref).\n【131】 Irritant with vesicant-like properties; ensure proper needle or catheter placement prior to and during infusion. Avoid extravasation; monitor IV site for redness, swelling, or pain.\n【132】 Information conflicts regarding use of warm or cold compresses. Cold compresses may cause local vasoconstriction and reduce cellular injury; however, may cause or exacerbate peripheral neuropathy; warm compresses may increase local drug removal, although may also increase cellular uptake and injury (Ref).\n【133】 Extravasation of moderate to large oxaliplatin doses (>40 mg) can result in pronounced tissue inflammation resembling erysipelas. Anti-inflammatory medication, such as high-dose oral dexamethasone, may reduce the severity of the inflammatory reaction (Ref).\n【134】 Hazardous Drugs Handling Considerations\n【135】 Hazardous agent (NIOSH 2016 [group 1]).\n【136】 Use appropriate precautions for receiving, handling, storage, preparation, dispensing, transporting, administration, and disposal. Follow NIOSH and <USP 800> recommendations and institution-specific policies/procedures for appropriate containment strategy (NIOSH 2016; USP-NF 2020).\n【137】 Storage/Stability\n【138】 Storage time varies by product; refer to individual product labeling for details. Store intact vials at 25°C (77°F); excursions permitted to 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F); do not freeze. Protect concentrated solution from light (store in original outer carton). According to the manufacturer, solutions diluted in D5W for infusion are stable up to 6 hours at room temperature of 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) or up to 24 hours under refrigeration at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). Solutions diluted for infusion do not require protection from light. Oxaliplatin solution diluted with D5W to a final concentration of 0.7 mg/mL (polyolefin container) has been shown to retain >90% of the original concentration for up to 30 days when stored at room temperature or refrigerated; artificial light did not affect the concentration (Andre 2007). As this study did not examine sterility, refrigeration would be preferred to limit microbial growth. Follow USP 797 recommendations for beyond use dates based on the level of risk for preparation.\n【139】 Use\n【140】 Treatment of stage III colon cancer (adjuvant) and advanced colorectal carcinoma (FDA approved in adults); has also been used in the treatment of relapsed/refractory childhood solid tumors including CNS and non-CNS tumors\n【141】 Medication Safety Issues\n【142】 High alert medication:\n【143】 Metabolism/Transport Effects\n【144】 Drug Interactions\n【145】 5-Aminosalicylic Acid Derivatives: May enhance the myelosuppressive effect of Myelosuppressive Agents.

Administering the taxane before platinum is likely warranted Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【165】 Topotecan: Platinum Derivatives may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Topotecan.  Management: Consider administering platinum derivatives after topotecan when possible to minimize toxicity or using lower doses if administering platinum derivatives prior to topotecan. Monitor for hematologic toxicity (eg, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia). Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【166】 Reproductive Considerations\n【167】 Verify pregnancy status prior to treatment initiation in patients who could become pregnant. Patients who could become pregnant should use effective contraception during treatment and for at least 9 months after the last oxaliplatin dose. Patients with partners who can become pregnant should use effective contraception during treatment and for 6 months after the last oxaliplatin dose.\n【168】 Oxaliplatin may adversely affect female fertility and have an intermediate risk of treatment-related azoospermia and male infertility (ESMO [Lambertini 2020]; Levi 2015). Recommendations are available for fertility preservation of male and female patients to be treated with anticancer agents (ASCO [Oktay 2018]; Klipstein 2020).\n【169】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【170】 Based on the mechanism of action and data from animal reproduction studies, in utero exposure to oxaliplatin may cause fetal harm.\n【171】 Outcome data following maternal use of oxaliplatin during pregnancy are available (Frydenberg 2020; Kozai 2022; NTP 2013; Petruzzelli 2020).\n【172】 The European Society for Medical Oncology has published guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of cancer during pregnancy. The guidelines recommend referral to a facility with expertise in cancer during pregnancy and encourage a multidisciplinary team (obstetrician, neonatologist, oncology team) approach. In general, if chemotherapy is indicated, it should be avoided in the first trimester, there should be a 3-week time period between the last chemotherapy dose and anticipated delivery, and chemotherapy should not be administered beyond week 33 of gestation (ESMO [Peccatori 2013]).\n【173】 Monitoring Parameters\n【174】 CBC with differential, blood chemistries, including serum creatinine, ALT, AST, and bilirubin (prior  to each cycle); electrolytes, including potassium and magnesium (prior to and periodically during treatment); INR and prothrombin time (in patients on oral anticoagulant therapy); signs of neuropathy, hypersensitivity reaction, respiratory effects, and/or RPLS\n【175】 Mechanism of Action\n【176】 Oxaliplatin, a platinum derivative, is an alkylating agent. Following intracellular hydrolysis, the platinum compound binds to DNA forming cross-links which inhibit DNA replication and transcription, resulting in cell death. Cytotoxicity is cell-cycle nonspecific.\n【177】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【178】 Distribution: Vd: 440 L.\n【179】 Protein binding: >90% primarily albumin and gamma globulin (irreversible binding to platinum).\n【180】 Metabolism: Nonenzymatic (rapid and extensive), forms active and inactive derivatives.\n【181】 Half-life elimination:\n【182】 Children: Oxaliplatin ultrafilterable platinum (terminal): Median: 293 hours; range: 187 to 662 hours (Beaty 2010).\n【183】 Adults: Oxaliplatin ultrafilterable platinum: Distribution: Alpha phase: 0.43 hours; Beta phase: 16.8 hours; Terminal: 392 hours.\n【184】 Excretion: Urine (~54%); feces (~2%).\n【185】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【186】 Altered kidney function: The mean AUC of unbound platinum increases as renal function decreases: 40% increase with mild (CrCl 50 to 80 mL/minute), 95% increase with moderate (CrCl 30 to 49 mL/minute), and 342% increase with severe (CrCl <30 mL/minute) renal impairment compared with patients with normal renal function.

Sugar gets into the cells with the help of a hormone called insulin. If there is not enough insulin or if your body stops responding to insulin, sugar builds up in the blood. This is what happens to people with diabetes. High blood sugar levels can lead to problems if untreated.\n【3】 There are two different types of diabetes, type 1 and type 2:\n【4】 In the United States, Canada, and Europe, approximately 90 percent of all people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. This is a chronic medical condition that requires regular monitoring and treatment throughout your life in order to keep your blood sugar levels as close to normal as possible. This involves lifestyle changes (including your diet and exercise habits), self-care measures, and sometimes medications. Fortunately, these treatments can keep your blood sugar levels under control and minimize your risk of developing complications.\n【5】 This topic provides a general overview of type 2 diabetes.\n【6】 THE IMPACT OF DIABETES — Being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes can be a frightening and overwhelming experience, and you likely have questions about why it developed, what it means for your long-term health, and how it will affect your everyday life. Your doctor or nurse can help answer your questions and talk to you about what to expect. They can also direct you to resources for medical, as well as psychological, support. These may include group classes; meetings with a registered dietitian, social worker, or nurse educator; and other educational resources such as books, websites, or magazines. Several of these resources are listed below.  'Where to get more information' below.)\n【7】 For most people, the first few months after being diagnosed are filled with emotional highs and lows. If you have just been diagnosed with diabetes, you and your family should use this time to learn as much as possible so that caring for your diabetes (including testing your blood sugar, going to medical appointments, and taking your medications) becomes a part of your daily routine.   \"\n【8】 Type 2 diabetes can lead to health complications, some of which can be serious. However, there are things you can do to reduce your risk of developing these problems   \"\n【9】 TYPE 2 DIABETES CAUSES — Type 2 diabetes is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n【10】 Genetic causes — Many people with type 2 diabetes have a family member with either type 2 diabetes or other medical problems associated with diabetes, such as high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, or obesity.\n【11】 The lifetime risk of developing type 2 diabetes is 5 to 10 times higher in first-degree relatives (ie, sibling or child) of a person with diabetes compared with a person with no family history of diabetes. The likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes is greater in certain ethnic groups, such as people of Hispanic, African, and Asian descent.\n【12】 Lifestyle factors — Eating an unhealthy diet and not getting enough exercise can lead to weight gain, which increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.\n【13】 Pregnancy — A small number of pregnant women develop diabetes during pregnancy, called \"gestational diabetes.\" Gestational diabetes is similar to type 2 diabetes, but it usually resolves after the woman delivers her baby. Women who develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy are at increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life.   \"\n【14】 TYPE 2 DIABETES DIAGNOSIS — The diagnosis of diabetes is based upon your symptoms and the results of blood tests.\n【15】 Symptoms — Before being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, most people have no symptoms at all. In those who do have symptoms, the most common include:\n【16】 Laboratory tests — The main test doctors use to diagnose diabetes is a blood glucose (sugar) test. This can be done in several different ways:\n【17】 Criteria for diagnosis — The following criteria are used to classify your blood sugar levels as normal, increased risk (blood sugar levels that are higher than normal and indicate a risk of future diabetes), or diabetes.\n【18】 Normal — Fasting blood sugar less than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) is considered normal, that is, it does not indicate an increased risk for diabetes.\n【19】 Increased risk — Some test results put a person in the category of \"increased risk,\" meaning they are at risk of going on to develop diabetes:\n【20】 These categories of increased risk are sometimes called \"prediabetes.\" Approximately one in three American adults can be classified as having prediabetes. If your test results suggest you are at increased risk, your doctor or nurse can talk to you about changes you can make to reduce your risk of developing diabetes. These include improving your diet and exercise habits, losing weight, and quitting smoking (if you smoke). Blood sugar testing is repeated every year.\n【21】 Although the rate of progression varies, approximately 25 percent of people with either impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance will go on to develop type 2 diabetes over three to five years.\n【22】 Diabetes — Doctors diagnose diabetes if a person has one or more of the following:\n【23】 If your results suggest diabetes, your doctor will repeat one of these tests on another day to confirm the diagnosis.\n【24】 Type 1 versus type 2 diabetes — Doctors can usually tell whether a person has type 1 or type 2 diabetes, but there are situations in which the diagnosis is difficult to determine. Type 1 diabetes should be suspected in a person without a strong family history of type 2 diabetes who has the following combination of risk factors:\n【25】 In such cases, doctors often run additional blood tests to determine which type the person has.\n【26】 TYPE 2 DIABETES TREATMENT — The treatment of type 2 diabetes is discussed in detail separately.   \"\n【27】 More information about lifestyle changes for people with diabetes is also available.   \"\n【28】 TYPE 2 DIABETES COMPLICATIONS — Complications of type 2 diabetes can be related to the disease itself or to the treatments used to manage diabetes.   \"\n【29】 PREGNANCY AND DIABETES — Women with type 2 diabetes are usually able to become pregnant and have a healthy baby. A full discussion of diabetes in pregnancy is available separately.   \"\n【30】 WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION — Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.\n【31】 The Basics — The Basics patient education pieces answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.\n【32】 Beyond the Basics — Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【33】 Professional level information — Professional level articles are designed to keep doctors and other health professionals up-to-date on the latest medical findings. These articles are thorough, long, and complex, and they contain multiple references to the research on which they are based. Professional level articles are best for people who are comfortable with a lot of medical terminology and who want to read the same materials their doctors are reading.\n【34】 The following organizations also provide reliable health information.\n", "title": "Patient education  Type 2 diabetes  Overview (Beyond the Basics)", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/type-2-diabetes-overview-beyond-the-basics?search=%E5%B0%BF%E4%B8%8D%E5%B0%BD%E6%84%9F&source=search_result&selectedTitle=147%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:30:06"}

Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【75】 Reproductive Considerations\n【76】 Evaluate pregnancy status prior to use in patients who may become pregnant.\n【77】 Patients who may become pregnant should use effective contraception during therapy and for 2 months after the last naxitamab dose.\n【78】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【79】 Naxitamab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1). Placental transfer of human IgG is dependent upon the IgG subclass, maternal serum concentrations, newborn birth weight, and gestational age, generally increasing as pregnancy progresses. The lowest exposure would be expected during the period of organogenesis (Palmeira 2012; Pentsuk 2009).\n【80】 Based on the mechanism of action, in utero exposure to naxitamab may cause fetal harm.\n【81】 Monitoring Parameters\n【82】 Monitor closely for signs/symptoms of infusion reactions (during and for at least 2 hours after infusion completion). Monitor blood pressure during infusion and at least daily on days 1 to 8 of each cycle; monitor for hypertensive complications. Monitor for signs/symptoms of pain, transverse myelitis, reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, urinary retention, and ocular symptoms.\n【83】 Mechanism of Action\n【84】 Naxitamab binds to the glycolipid disialoganglioside (GD2), which is highly expressed in neuroblastoma, and other cells of neuroectodermal origin, including the central nervous system and peripheral nerves. By binding to cell surface GD2, naxitamab induces cell lysis (of GD2-expressing cells) through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC).\n【85】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【86】 Metabolism: Metabolized into small peptides by catabolic pathways.\n【87】 Half-life elimination: 8.2 days.\n【88】 Brand Names: International\n【89】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Naxitamab  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/naxitamab-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E5%B1%80%E9%99%90%E6%80%A7%E5%A4%9A%E6%B1%97%E7%97%87&source=search_result&selectedTitle=120%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:10:39"}

Consistent with other studies, a large retrospective cohort study involving 1,200,438 children, adolescents, and young adults (aged 2 to 24 years) prescribed methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamines, amphetamine salts, pemoline, or atomoxetine found no evidence that current use of an ADHD medication increased risk for sudden cardiac death, acute MI, or stroke (Cooper 2011). Stimulants should be avoided in the patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart rhythm abnormalities, coronary artery disease, Marfan syndrome, or other serious cardiac problems. Some products are contraindicated in patients with moderate or severe hypertension. Prior to initiating stimulant, assess medical history and family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia; conduct a physical exam to assess for cardiac disease; patients should receive further evaluation if findings suggest cardiac disease, such as ECG and echocardiogram. Promptly conduct cardiac evaluation in patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or any other symptoms of cardiac disease during stimulant treatment.\n【48】 CNS effects: May impair the ability to engage in potentially hazardous activities; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks that require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving).\n【49】 Hypersensitivity: Angioedema and anaphylactic reactions have been reported.\n【50】 Hypertension/tachycardia: May occur; monitor blood pressure and heart rate in all patients.\n【51】 Peripheral vasculopathy: Stimulants are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud phenomenon; signs/symptoms are usually mild and intermittent, and generally improve with dose reduction or discontinuation. Peripheral vasculopathy effects have been observed at different times, at therapeutic doses, and in all age groups. Digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown have been observed rarely; monitor for digital changes during therapy and  if necessary (Syed 2008).\n【52】 Serotonin syndrome: Potentially life-threatening serotonin syndrome (SS) may occur when amphetamine is used in combination with other serotonergic agents (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, St. John's wort, tryptophan), agents that impair metabolism of serotonin (eg, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or CYP2D6 inhibitors that impair metabolism of amphetamine. Concomitant use with monoamine oxidase inhibitors is contraindicated. If concomitant use of amphetamine with serotonergic drugs or CYP2D6 inhibitors is indicated, initiate amphetamine at a low dose and monitor patient closely for signs and symptoms of SS. Discontinue treatment (and any concomitant serotonergic agent) immediately if signs/symptoms arise.\n【53】 Visual disturbance: Difficulty in accommodation and blurred vision has been reported with the use of stimulants.\n【54】 Abuse potential: [US Boxed Warning]: Potential for drug abuse and dependency exists; prolonged use may lead to drug dependency and must be avoided. Assess the risk for abuse prior to prescribing, and monitor for signs of abuse and dependence while on therapy. Consider the possibility of patients obtaining amphetamines for non-therapeutic use or distribution to others; prescribe sparingly. Use of immediate-release formulation is contraindicated in patients with history of drug abuse. Write prescriptions for the smallest quantity consistent with good patient care to minimize possibility of overdose.\n【55】 Cardiovascular disease: CNS stimulants may increase heart rate and blood pressure; in pediatric patients, the observed mean increase in heart rate was 3 to 6 bpm and blood pressure was 2 to 4 mm Hg. Use with caution in patients with hypertension, heart failure, recent MI, ventricular arrhythmia, and other cardiovascular conditions that might be exacerbated by increases in blood pressure or heart rate. Some products are contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe hypertension or hyperthyroidism.\n【56】 Psychiatric disorders: Use with caution in patients with preexisting psychosis (may exacerbate symptoms of behavior and thought disorder) or bipolar disorder (may induce mixed/manic episode). New-onset psychosis or mania may occur with stimulant use. Patients should be screened for bipolar disorder and risk factors for developing a manic episode prior to treatment; consider discontinuation if psychotic or manic symptoms (eg, delusional thinking, hallucinations, mania). May be associated with aggressive behavior or hostility (causal relationship not established); monitor for development or worsening of these behaviors.\n【57】 Seizure disorder: Limited information exists regarding stimulant use in seizure disorder. Whereas patients with ADHD are at an increased risk for seizure activity compared to the general population, a retrospective study using drug claims data showed that the use of stimulant medications was associated with a lower risk (Cortese 2013; Wiggs 2018). Manufacturers of some stimulants recommend discontinuing therapy if seizures occur.\n【58】 Tourette syndrome/tics: Use with caution in patients with Tourette syndrome or other tic disorders. Stimulants may exacerbate tics (motor and phonic) and Tourette syndrome; however, evidence demonstrating increased tics is limited. Evaluate for tics and Tourette syndrome prior to therapy initiation (AACAP [Murphy 2013]; Pliszka 2007).\n【59】 Pediatric: Appetite suppression may occur, particularly in children. Use of stimulants has been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate; monitor growth rate and weight during treatment. Monitor weight during therapy; treatment interruption may be necessary in patients who are not increasing in height or gaining weight as expected.\n【60】 Intestinal necrosis: Adzenys ER: Cases of intestinal necrosis, including some deaths, have been reported with the concomitant use of sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol, two of the inactive ingredients in Adzenys ER. In these cases, patients were administered sodium polystyrene sulfonate at doses greater than 200 times the amount present in Adzenys ER, however no absolute safe levels for the interaction of sodium polystyrene sulfonate and sorbitol have been established.\n【61】 Discontinuation of therapy: Abrupt discontinuation following high doses or for prolonged periods may result in symptoms of withdrawal.\n【62】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【63】 CNS stimulant treatment has been associated with sudden death in children and adolescents with preexisting structural cardiac abnormalities; one study reported methylphenidate increased risk for arrhythmia and MI in youth without congenital heart disease (Shin 2016) and a retrospective case-control study reported an association with stimulants and sudden unexplained death in youth (Gould 2009). However, as noted in reviews (Martinez-Raga 2013; Westover 2012) several large studies have not found an association between prescription stimulants and cardiovascular events; though most retrospective studies were large (n=55,383 to 2,131,953), some had statistical power or methodological limitations (Westover 2012). A large retrospective cohort study involving 1,200,438 children and young adults (aged 2 to 24 years) prescribed ADHD medication (methylphenidate, dexmethylphenidate, dextroamphetamines, amphetamine salts, pemoline, or atomoxetine) found no evidence that ADHD medication was associated with an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events (ie, acute MI, sudden cardiac death, stroke) in current (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.31 to 1.85) or former (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.57 to 1.89) users compared with nonusers, nor in current compared with former users. Results were similar with multiple alternative analyses to assess for bias or study assumptions. While point estimates of relative risks for ADHD drugs did not demonstrate increased risk, the upper limit of the 95% CI suggested a doubling of the risk could not be ruled out, although absolute magnitude of increased risk would be low. Data on any individual medication, other than methylphenidate, were too sparse for separate regression analyses (Cooper 2011). Prior to treatment with medications for ADHD, the American Heart Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that all children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD have a thorough cardiovascular assessment, including patient and family health histories, determination of all medications used (prescribed and over-the-counter), and a physical examination focused on cardiovascular disease risk factors. An ECG is not mandatory but is reasonable to consider prior to stimulant medication therapy. Prompt evaluation and appropriate referral and testing, if warranted, should occur if any cardiac symptoms present (Vetter 2008).\n【64】 Use of stimulants in children has been associated with growth suppression; monitor growth; treatment interruption may be needed. Appetite suppression may occur; monitor weight during therapy, particularly in children. Evaluation of the effect of stimulants on growth in ADHD diagnosed children <12 years receiving treatment for at least 3 years with stimulants has shown decreased height and weight changes over time compared to age matched control; height: 4.7 to 5.5 cm/year compared to 6.3 cm/year and 2.1 to 3.3 kg/year compared to 4.4 kg/year (Poulton 2016). In pediatric patients 8 to 17 years actively treated with stimulants, significant reductions in total femoral, femoral neck, and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) were observed compared to matched unmedicated cohorts; also reported were significantly more subjects in the stimulant-treated group with BMD measurements in the osteopenic range compared to matched cohorts (38.3% to 21.6%) (Howard 2017). A longitudinal cohort-controlled trial reported no different in peak height velocity and final adult height in subjects with ADHD and/or treated with stimulants (Harstad 2014).\n【65】 Product Availability\n【66】 Adzenys ER has been discontinued in the United States for >1 year.\n【67】 Dosage Forms: US\n【68】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Management: Monitor response when taken concurrently.\n【228】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【229】 Information related to use of amphetamine in pregnancy is limited (Maurovich-Horvat 2013). The majority of human data are based on illicit amphetamine/methamphetamine exposure and not from therapeutic maternal use (Golub 2005). Use of amphetamines during pregnancy may lead to an increased risk of premature birth and low birth weight; newborns may experience symptoms of withdrawal. Behavioral problems may also occur later in childhood (LaGasse 2012). Newborns should be monitored for agitation, irritability, excessive drowsiness, or feeding difficulties\n【230】 Monitoring Parameters\n【231】 Prior to initiation of therapy, assess medical history and family history of sudden death or ventricular arrhythmia, and physical exam to assess for cardiac disease; patients should receive further evaluation if findings suggest cardiac disease, such as ECG and echocardiogram; promptly conduct cardiac evaluation in patients who develop exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or any other symptom of cardiac disease during treatment. For children already taking a stimulant, it is reasonable to evaluate medical and family history, review physical examination, and order ECG if not done prior to initiation (Vetter 2008).\n【232】 Monitor growth (weight and height in children; baseline and periodically during therapy); other parameters to monitor periodically during therapy: CBC with differential and platelet count, liver enzymes, blood pressure and heart rate (baseline, following dose increases, and periodically during treatment), appetite, and sleep patterns; observe for abnormal movements. Patients should be reevaluated at appropriate intervals to assess continued need of the medication. Observe for signs/symptoms of new or worsening aggression or hostility, depression, delusional thinking, hallucinations, or mania. Monitor for visual disturbances. Observe for digital changes suggestive of peripheral vasculopathy (eg, Raynaud phenomenon). Monitor for signs of misuse, abuse, substance use disorder, and diversion.\n【233】 Mechanism of Action\n【234】 Amphetamines are noncatecholamine sympathomimetic amines that promote release of catecholamines (primarily dopamine and norepinephrine) from their storage sites in the presynaptic nerve terminals. A less significant mechanism may include their ability to block the reuptake of catecholamines by competitive inhibition. The anorexigenic effect is probably secondary to the CNS-stimulating effect; the site of action is probably the hypothalamic feeding center.\n【235】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【236】 Duration of action: Oral:\n【237】 Immediate-release tablet: Evekeo: 4 to 6 hours (Jain 2017).\n【238】 Extended-release orally-disintegrating tablet: Adzenys XR-ODT: 10 to 12 hours.\n【239】 Absorption: Oral:\n【240】 Immediate-release tablet: Rapid (de la Torre 2004).\n【241】 Immediate-release orally-disintegrating tablet: Evekeo ODT: Cmax and AUC comparable to equivalent immediate-release dose.\n【242】 Distribution: Oral: Immediate-release tablet: Vd: 3 to 4 L/kg (de la Torre 2004).\n【243】 Protein binding: Oral: Immediate-release tablet: 16% (de la Torre 2004).\n【244】 Metabolism: Hepatic via oxidation, deamination, and CYP2D6.\n【245】 Bioavailability: Oral:\n【246】 Immediate-release tablet: Good (de la Torre 2004).\n【247】 Dyanavel XR suspension:\n【248】 Relative to equivalent dose of immediate-release mixed amphetamine salts: 106% of d-amphetamine and 111% for l-amphetamine.\n【249】 Relative to equivalent dose of extended-release mixed amphetamine salts: 94% of d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine.\n【250】 Dyanavel XR tablet: Relative to equivalent dose of Dyanavel XR suspension: 105% of d-amphetamine and 106% of l-amphetamine.\n【251】 Half-life elimination: Oral:\n【252】 Immediate-release tablet: 12 hours (de la Torre 2004).\n【253】 Immediate-release orally-disintegrating tablet: Evekeo ODT: Adults: d-amphetamine 10 hours and l-amphetamine 11.7 hours.\n【254】 Extended-release orally-disintegrating tablet: Adzenys XR-ODT:\n【255】 Children 6 to 12 years: d-amphetamine 9 to 10 hours and l-amphetamine 10 to 11 hours.\n【256】 Adults: d-amphetamine 11 hours and l-amphetamine 14 hours.\n【257】 Extended-release suspension:\n【258】 Adzenys ER:\n【259】 Children 6 to 12 years: d-amphetamine 12.7 hours (mean) and l-amphetamine 15.3 hours.\n【260】 Adults: d-amphetamine 11.4 hours and l-amphetamine 14.1 hours.\n【261】 Dyanavel XR:\n【262】 Children: d-amphetamine 10.43 ± 2.01 hours and l-amphetamine 12.14 ± 3.15 hours.\n【263】 Adults: d-amphetamine 12.36 ± 2.95 hours and l-amphetamine 15.12 ± 4.4 hours.\n【264】 Extended-release tablet: Dyanavel XR: Mean: Adults: d-amphetamine 13.5 hours and l-amphetamine 17.3 hours.\n【265】 Time to peak, serum: Oral:\n【266】 Immediate-release tablet: Within 4 hours (de la Torre 2004).\n【267】 Immediate-release orally-disintegrating tablet: Evekeo ODT: Median time d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine 3.5 hours (with water) and 3 hours (without water); increased with food in adults.\n【268】 Extended-release orally-disintegrating tablet: Adzenys XR-ODT: Median time d-amphetamine 5 hours (7 hours with food) and l-amphetamine ~5.25 hours (7.75 hours with food).\n【269】 Adzenys ER suspension: d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine: 5 hours (median) with or without food.\n【270】 Children: Median time d-amphetamine 3.9 hours and l-amphetamine 4.5 hours.\n【271】 Adults: 4 (2 to 7) hours.\n【272】 Extended-release tablet: d-amphetamine and l-amphetamine: 5 hours (median; range 2 to 9 hours) without food.\n【273】 Excretion: Urine (30% to 40% unchanged; ~50% as metabolites).\n【274】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【275】 Body weight: Systemic exposure and maximum concentration of d- and l-amphetamine decrease as body weight increases; volume of distribution, clearance, and half-life increase as body weight increases.\n【276】 Brand Names: International\n【277】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Amphetamine (single-ingredient pharmaceutical)  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www-uptodate-com.webvpn.sjlib.cn//contents/amphetamine-single-ingredient-pharmaceutical-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E6%85%A2%E6%80%A7%E5%8F%91%E5%A3%B0%E6%8A%BD%E5%8A%A8%E9%9A%9C%E7%A2%8D&source=search_result&selectedTitle=79%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:47:50"}

{"id": 588730, "user_id": "6576f4e0014d3d1c31d6fe43", "user_name": "曾垂松", "task_id": 241, "source_info": {"seq_id": "3662", "text": "【0】 儿科体格检查：背部、四肢、神经系统、皮肤和淋巴结\n【1】 Any midline soft tissue lesion overlying the spine (eg, dimple, vascular anomaly, pigmented nevus, sacral hair tuft) should raise suspicion of an underlying neurologic defect . Defects of the bony spine or of the overlying skin or soft tissue in an infant may indicate the presence of a meningocele, myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele, diastematomyelia, abscess, or tumor. With many of these lesions, the neurologic deficits may be sufficiently severe to lead to genitourinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, and/or lower extremity impairment.   \"Closed spinal dysraphism: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\", section on 'Cutaneous'.)\n【2】 Midline dimples in the skin overlying the coccyx generally are of no significance. Dimples above the gluteal cleft and on or above the flat part of the sacrum (ie, lumbosacral dermal sinus tracts) usually require neuroimaging and/or neurosurgical evaluation.   \"Closed spinal dysraphism: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management\", section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'.)\n【3】 Scoliosis in the neonate has great significance because it produces cosmetic problems and may be associated with visceral and/or neurologic dysfunction.   \"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis\", section on 'Congenital scoliosis'.)\n【4】 Flattened buttocks and shortening of the cephalad extent of the gluteal cleft is the classic sign of sacral agenesis. The clinician should ask the caregiver about maternal type 1 diabetes and must order a lateral radiologic image of the lower spine to confirm the diagnosis\n【5】 Neonates and infants may have bluish macular skin lesions, most commonly located in the lumbar and sacral-gluteal area, known as congenital dermal melanocytosis\n【6】 All patients, particularly children in the preadolescent years, should undergo examination of the spine for scoliosis. Acquired scoliosis in preadolescents may herald important pathology (eg, spinal cord or vertebral bone tumors). On the other hand, idiopathic scoliosis, which is most common in adolescent females, can usually be followed with observation.   \"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: Clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis\", section on 'Clinical evaluation'.)\n【7】 Proper examination requires unobstructed visualization of the back. The patient should be standing straight, but not rigid, with feet together and arms at the sides. Asymmetry of the back structures should be noted. For the second phase of the examination, the patient should be asked to bend over at the waist with legs straight, feet together, arms in a dependent position with the tips of the thumbs apposed, and head directed toward the floor in a relaxed position. The presence of a rib hump or abnormal curvature should be noted.\n【8】 In addition to inspection for scoliosis, the spine should be examined for kyphosis and lordosis. A normal lumbar lordotic curvature, giving rise to a pot-bellied appearance, is found in most toddlers. Spontaneous resolution of the curvature occurs in almost all as they advance into early childhood. Mild lumbar lordosis and/or thoracic kyphosis require no intervention; more prominent forms of either deformity warrant thorough evaluation.\n【9】 During the first seven years of life, lower extremity alignment goes through a predictable progression from bow-legs to knock-knees\n【10】 Toe walking, found in patients with cerebral palsy, may be a transient finding in some normal infants. Passive range of motion of the foot will help distinguish a tight heel cord that is limiting normal dorsiflexion from the full range of motion seen in the otherwise normal toe walker.\n【11】 Possible causes of a limp in children include infection; neuromuscular or neurologic problems; primary bone, cartilage, ligament, and/or joint abnormalities; allergic and/or inflammatory processes; cancer; mass lesions; and foreign bodies\n【12】 Essentially all lesions originating in the skin of children are benign. Lesions without an altered appearance of the epidermis, however, may not be easy to categorize. A mass that during palpation moves freely over the underlying fascia most likely is present in the subcutaneous tissue and should be considered benign. Malignancy is a possibility when the lesion is fixed to the underlying fascia or the examiner is unsure of what is being felt; an appropriate referral should be made in this circumstance .\n【13】 Palpation of the skin may reveal rough, coarse, or dry areas in the region of the neck, knee, or elbow, which often are found in patients with atopic dermatitis. Large patches of coarse papular lesions palpable over the dorsal surfaces of the upper arms and thighs of an older child or adolescent may be compatible with hyperkeratosis pilaris. An elongated or patchy area of moist, erythematous, denuded, pruritic skin may be seen in patients with contact dermatitis caused by poison ivy. Pink, raised, pruritic lesions of various sizes and shapes, diffusely scattered over the body, are found in patients with urticaria.\n【14】 Increased skin pigmentation owing to an excess of melanin may be localized or diffuse. Between one and four light brown macular lesions (cafe-au-lait spots) no greater than 0.5 to 1.0 cm at their largest diameter (depending on the patient's age) is a normal finding in many patients. Larger and more numerous cafe-au-lait spots can be seen in neurofibromatosis\n【15】 More darkly pigmented cutaneous tumors that appear anywhere on the body may be present at birth or appear years later. Large congenital and atypical nevi (usually developing during the second decade of life) may become melanoma. Melanomas are found rarely in infants and children; they have an irregular border with deeply pigmented or varied colored areas, may have ulcerations or satellite lesions, and have a tendency to grow .   \"Congenital melanocytic nevi\" and  \"Acquired melanocytic nevi (moles)\", section on 'Atypical nevi' and  \"Screening for melanoma in adults and adolescents\".)\n【16】 Acquired nevi (not present at birth) are less than 1 cm in diameter, may be flat or slightly raised, are light brown to black in color, and have discrete regular borders. They develop during the first several decades of life and often eventually disappear. Though the vast majority of acquired nevi are harmless, certain changes, including rapid darkening, changes in size or borders, ulceration, itching, pain, or bleeding, indicate a need for biopsy and histologic evaluation .   \"Acquired melanocytic nevi (moles)\".)\n【17】 Infantile hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors composed of proliferating vascular endothelium\n【18】 Vascular lesions that neither proliferate nor involute and are caused by inborn errors of vascular morphogenesis are termed venous malformations . They grow in proportion to the growth of the child and may require treatment. The facial port-wine stain\n【19】 The spider nevus, the best-known type of telangiectasia (also known as spider angioma, vascular spider, or nevus aranei), is a central vascular papule surrounded by symmetrically radiating branches . Spider nevi appear most commonly on exposed areas of the face, upper trunk, arms, hands, and fingers. They are associated with liver disease, pregnancy, and estrogen therapy but also may occur in individuals without these conditions. In an observational study, 38 percent of 426 children (aged 1 to 15 years) without liver disease had ≥1 spider nevus; most had between one and four; only 7 children (1.6 percent) had ≥5 . Among children with chronic liver disease, 16 of 34 (47 percent) had no spider nevi and four (12 percent) had ≥5 . Most spider nevi persist indefinitely, although some may regress spontaneously . When treatment is desired, treatment options include electrocoagulation and pulsed dye laser therapy .\n【20】 Striae tend to occur in areas of excessive stretching of the skin, eg, the abdomen, lower back, breasts, buttocks, and thighs. Individuals with rapid weight gain, females who are pregnant, and pubescent adolescents with rapid overall growth frequently develop striae. Striae also may occur in patients with anorexia nervosa . Adolescents engaged in weight-lifting programs may develop striae of the shoulder and chest areas. Excessive adrenocortical activity (Cushing's disease), as well as prolonged use of oral and potent topical corticosteroids, can lead to striae formation  .\n【21】 Striae appearing during adolescence tend to regress spontaneously over time. Treatment may be warranted for striae that are persistent or cosmetically unacceptable. Treatment of striae is discussed separately.   \"Striae distensae (stretch marks)\", section on 'Treatment'.)\n【22】 Though cosmetically unattractive, warts on the hands and feet\n【23】 Pyogenic granulomata are benign, generally small, raised papules appearing anywhere on the skin  . They bleed easily and are best treated with silver nitrate or electrocautery.\n【24】 Sebaceous cysts occur at anatomical sites where hair is present. They should be surgically removed if unsightly or bothersome.\n【25】 Routine examination of the lymph nodes includes attention to size, consistency mobility, tenderness, adhesion to adjacent tissues, and the temperature and condition of the overlying skin . Nodes that grow slowly generally are benign; those that grow rapidly and are rubbery, hard, nontender, and matted tend to be malignant. Enlarged, tender nodes with increased warmth to the overlying skin usually are infected. The causes of enlarged lymph nodes, the lymph node examination, and the approach to the child with enlarged lymph nodes are discussed in detail separately.   \"Peripheral lymphadenopathy in children: Evaluation and diagnostic approach\" and  \"Peripheral lymphadenopathy in children: Etiology\", section on 'General classification'.)\n", "title": "儿科体格检查：背部、四肢、神经系统、皮肤和淋巴结", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/the-pediatric-physical-examination-back-extremities-nervous-system-skin-and-lymph-nodes?search=%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E7%9A%AE%E8%82%A4%E7%B2%98%E8%86%9C%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E7%97%85%E7%B1%BB%EF%BC%88TM1%EF%BC%89&source=search_result&selectedTitle=5%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:47:56"}

It does not cure or treat the underlying kidney disease. It is intended to replace as many functions of the failing kidneys as possible. The procedure is performed at home and primarily works to remove excess fluid and waste products from the blood.\n【2】 This topic discusses peritoneal dialysis. Other treatments for chronic kidney disease are discussed separately.   \"\n【3】 WHEN WILL I NEED DIALYSIS? — As the kidneys lose their ability to function, fluid, minerals, and waste products that are normally removed from the body in the urine begin to build up in the blood. When these problems reach a critical stage, excess fluid and waste must be removed either by getting a kidney transplant or with kidney (renal) replacement therapy (also called dialysis).\n【4】 There are two types of dialysis: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Kidney transplantation may be an option for some people, although dialysis is the most commonly used treatment. The \"best\" type of dialysis depends upon your abilities, underlying medical illnesses, and personal needs. These issues are discussed separately.   \"\n【5】 It usually takes many months or years after kidney disease is first discovered before dialysis is necessary. However, some people have a rapid decline in kidney function, and, occasionally, require dialysis soon after diagnosis.   \"\n【6】 You and your doctor will decide together if dialysis would be of benefit to you and when to begin dialysis after considering a number of factors, including your kidney function (as measured by blood and urine tests), overall health, and personal preferences.\n【7】 Advance planning — People with kidney disease should discuss the possible need for dialysis early in their treatment course. Advance planning allows the clinician to choose a therapy that will best meet the person's lifestyle and needs. During these discussions, the person should learn about all types of dialysis options available to them. Sometimes, the type of dialysis best suited for an individual can change, depending upon changes in their health over time; this may necessitate switching from one type of dialysis to another. The person should let the dialysis staff and their doctors know about their important life plans, goals, and wishes for the following years so that the type of dialysis recommended to them is best suited to those goals and wishes. Most people do not have a medical condition that would keep them from doing peritoneal dialysis. If the person and their clinician decide that peritoneal dialysis would be the most suitable option, then advance planning can allow the clinician time to plan for the placement of a peritoneal dialysis catheter in the abdomen.\n【8】 After the catheter is placed, the person and their family will be trained by the staff at the home dialysis unit on how to set up the equipment and become familiar with the procedures used in peritoneal dialysis. During most of this \"training,\" the person will actually be doing dialysis.\n【9】 PERITONEAL DIALYSIS CATHETER INSERTION — Before peritoneal dialysis can begin, a catheter (thin tube) must be inserted in the abdomen, which allows for transfer of fluid into and out of the abdominal cavity. The catheter is made of a soft, flexible material (usually silicone) and has cuffs (which are like Velcro), which are placed under the skin. Skin tissue grows into them to hold the catheter in place. The end of the catheter inside the abdomen has multiple holes to allow fluid to flow in and out.\n【10】 The site on the abdomen where the catheter comes out is called the \"exit site.\" The catheter exit site is typically chosen to be on the left or right of the belly button, although, occasionally, it may be higher up on the abdominal wall or over the sternum (breast bone). Reasons to choose a particular exit site vary from person to person and should be discussed with the doctor; the person may be given general or local anesthesia before the insertion procedure.   \"Placement of the peritoneal dialysis catheter\".)\n【11】 Although the catheter can be used right away, if dialysis is not needed, it is best to wait 10 to 14 days after placement before dialysis is performed; this allows the catheter site to heal. In some cases, a small volume of fluid can be exchanged during this time  'How does peritoneal dialysis work?' below). Your health care provider will provide more detailed instructions.\n【12】 PERITONEAL DIALYSIS CATHETER SITE CARE — Care of the catheter and the skin around the catheter (called the catheter exit site) is important to keep the catheter functioning and also to minimize the risk of developing an infection.\n【13】 Care after insertion — After the catheter is inserted, the insertion site is usually covered with a gauze dressing and tape to prevent the catheter from moving and to keep the area clean. For the first 7 to 10 days after the catheter insertion, typically nothing needs to be done to the catheter exit site. The dressing is typically left alone and usually first changed at the dialysis home training center 7 to 10 days after placement. If a dressing change is needed before this time, it should be done by a specially trained peritoneal dialysis nurse using sterile techniques. While the exit site is healing, the catheter should not be moved or handled excessively because this can increase the risk of infection.\n【14】 The area should be kept dry until it is well healed, usually for 10 to 14 days. This means that you should not take a shower or bath or go swimming during this time. A washcloth or sponge may be used to clean the body, although you should be careful to keep the catheter and dressing dry. While healing (two to three weeks), you will be asked to limit lifting and vigorous exercise.\n【15】 It is important to avoid becoming constipated after the catheter is inserted. Straining to move the bowels can increase the risk of developing a hernia (a weakness in the abdominal muscle). In addition, not moving the bowels regularly can lead to problems with catheter function (slow drain time or difficulty draining the abdomen completely). Your dialysis clinician will help prescribe medications to prevent or treat constipation, if needed.\n【16】 To avoid constipation, your health care provider may recommend a diet that is high in fiber, as well as a stool softener or laxative.   \"\n【17】 Long-term care — After the catheter site has healed (approximately two weeks after insertion), your dialysis nurse will instruct you on catheter exit-site care. It will be important to keep the area clean to minimize the risk of skin infection, as well as infection inside the abdomen (called peritonitis). In addition, most centers will recommend that you \"anchor\" the catheter with tape to stabilize the catheter and minimize the chance of movement causing some injury to the healed exit site.\n【18】 The skin around the catheter site should be washed daily or every other day with antibacterial soap or an antiseptic (either povidone iodine or chlorhexidine). The soap should be stored in the original bottle (not poured into another container). Other types of cleansers, such as hydrogen peroxide or alcohol, should NOT be used unless directed by a health care provider.\n【19】 With appropriate catheter placement and exit-site care, most peritoneal dialysis catheters are problem free and work for many years. If the catheter no longer works or is needed, a minor surgical procedure is required to remove it.\n【20】 Appearance — After the first two weeks, the skin around the catheter should not be red or painful. The skin should feel soft. There may be a small amount of thick, yellow mucus discharge around the catheter. A crust or scab may form every few days.\n【21】 If the skin is reddened, painful, firm, or there is pus-like discharge around the catheter, there may be an infection.  'Peritoneal dialysis complications' below.)\n【22】 Care after injury to the catheter site — If there is an injury to the catheter site, such as an accidental pull on the catheter, or if the catheter is moved excessively, a short course of oral antibiotics may be recommended to prevent infection from developing inside the abdomen (peritonitis). Most dialysis units recommend that you call if you injure the catheter site to determine if further evaluation or treatment is needed.\n【23】 HOW DOES PERITONEAL DIALYSIS WORK? — In peritoneal dialysis, dialysis fluid (called dialysate) is infused into the abdominal cavity (called the peritoneal cavity) through the catheter. The fluid is held (dwells) within the abdomen for a prescribed period of time; this is called a \"dwell.\" The lining of the abdomen (the peritoneum) acts as a membrane to allow excess fluids and waste products to pass from the bloodstream into the dialysate.\n【24】 When the dwell is completed, the \"used\" dialysate can then be drained out of the abdomen (called an exchange) into a sterile container or into a shower or bathtub. This used fluid contains the excess fluid and waste that has been removed from the blood that was normally eliminated in the urine. The peritoneal cavity is then filled again with fresh dialysate, and the process starts again.\n【25】 The process may be done manually four to five times during the day by infusing the fluid into the abdomen and later allowing it to run out by gravity. The process of connecting the bag of new dialysis fluid, emptying, and filling for each exchange takes 30 to 40 minutes when done manually. The exchange may also be done using a machine (called a cycler). This is what most people do. In this case, the fluid exchanges are done automatically while the person sleeps, and, because the catheter is already connected to the machine by a long tube, each exchange takes less time.\n【26】 At times when the abdomen is full of dialysate, you may have a feeling of fullness or bloating, although you should not feel pain. However, most people have no abnormal sensations, and, despite the fluid in the abdomen, most people do not look or feel any different themselves or look different to other observers.\n【27】 Types — Several different types of peritoneal dialysis schedules are possible. The \"right\" type of peritoneal dialysis depends upon an individual's situation.  'Which type is right for me?' below.)\n【28】 Which type is right for me? — People are often allowed to choose between CAPD and CCPD or APD based upon lifestyle or personal issues. CCPD or APD allows significantly more uninterrupted daytime for work, family, and social activities than CAPD.\n【29】 In some cases, a person is not able to do the dialysis exchanges themselves. Peritoneal dialysis could still be used, but the person would need a partner to do the exchanges. In these cases, APD works best so the partner is able to be free during the day.\n【30】 There may be changes in treatment type, dwell time, number of exchanges, or type of dialysate after beginning treatment based upon how the body responds. Periodic blood and urine tests, as well as tests of the used dialysate, are used to fine tune peritoneal dialysis treatment.   \"Prescribing peritoneal dialysis\".)\n【31】 PERITONEAL DIALYSIS COMPLICATIONS — One of the most serious complications of peritoneal dialysis is infection, which can develop in the skin around the catheter or inside the abdominal cavity (called peritonitis). Another potential, but less serious, complication of peritoneal dialysis is the development of a hernia, a weakness in the abdominal muscle.\n【32】 Catheter-site infection — The signs of catheter-site infection include:\n【33】 Peritonitis — Peritonitis is a general term used to describe an infection of the abdominal cavity. People who use peritoneal dialysis are at risk of peritonitis because bacteria can enter the abdomen through or around the peritoneal dialysis catheter.\n【34】 Peritonitis associated with peritoneal dialysis (PD peritonitis) is generally less severe compared with peritonitis resulting from other causes such as perforation of the bowel, appendicitis, or diverticulitis. PD peritonitis can usually be treated at home and usually resolves completely.   \"Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis\".)\n【35】 However, if left untreated, peritonitis can become a life-threatening infection. Signs of peritonitis may include one or more of the following:\n【36】 Treatment of infection — If there are any signs of infection, you need to be seen by a health care provider and begin treatment as soon as possible. The type of treatment used depends upon the severity and location of the infection. Peritoneal dialysis is usually continued as the infection is being treated.\n【37】 Hernia — Hernia is the medical term for a weakness in the abdominal muscle. People who use peritoneal dialysis are at risk of developing a hernia for several reasons, including the increased stress on the muscles of the abdomen (as a result of the weight of the dialysate) and the opening in the abdominal muscle created by the peritoneal dialysis catheter. Hernias can develop near the belly button (umbilical hernia), in the groin (inguinal hernia), or near the catheter site (incisional hernia).\n【38】 Signs of a hernia include painless swelling or new lump in the groin or abdomen. If you develop signs of a hernia, contact your health care provider but continue to perform peritoneal dialysis regularly. Treatment of a hernia generally involves surgery.   \"Abdominal wall hernia and dialysate leak in peritoneal dialysis patients\".)\n【39】 LIVING WITH PERITONEAL DIALYSIS — Chronic kidney disease is a lifelong condition that requires lifelong treatment. Peritoneal dialysis is one option for lifelong treatment, with other options including hemodialysis and kidney transplantation. It is sometimes necessary to switch from one form of treatment to another as circumstances change.\n【40】 It is important to perform every exchange and dwell exactly as recommended. Skipping a treatment or performing a dwell for shorter or longer than recommended may increase the risk of illness and the chances of being hospitalized and can even shorten the person's life.\n【41】 If the demands of peritoneal dialysis feel overwhelming or if you are having trouble performing all the necessary treatments, talk to a health care provider.\n【42】 WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION — Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.\n【43】 The Basics — The Basics patient education pieces answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.\n【44】 Beyond the Basics — Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【45】 Professional level information — Professional level articles are designed to keep doctors and other health professionals up-to-date on the latest medical findings. These articles are thorough, long, and complex, and they contain multiple references to the research on which they are based. Professional level articles are best for people who are comfortable with a lot of medical terminology and who want to read the same materials their doctors are reading.\n", "title": "Patient education  Peritoneal dialysis (Beyond the Basics)", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/peritoneal-dialysis-beyond-the-basics?search=%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E7%96%BE%E7%97%85%E6%88%96%E7%97%85%E5%8E%9F%E4%BD%93%E5%BC%95%E8%B5%B7%E7%9A%84%E7%BB%A7%E5%8F%91%E6%80%A7%E8%85%B9%E8%86%9C%E7%82%8E&source=search_result&selectedTitle=78%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:09:44"}

Administration with a protein supplement drink alone does not increase absorption.\n【99】 Grapefruit products: Grapefruit products may inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of rilpivirine and increase its exposure.\n【100】 Reproductive Considerations\n【101】 The Health and Human Services perinatal HIV guidelines consider oral rilpivirine an alternative component of antiretroviral therapy for patients with HIV infection who are not yet pregnant but are trying to conceive.\n【102】 Viral suppression sustained below the limits of detection with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and modification of therapy (if needed) is recommended in all patients with HIV infection who are planning a pregnancy. Optimization of the health of the person who will become pregnant and a discussion of the potential risks and benefits of ART during pregnancy is also recommended prior to conception. In most cases, recommendations from the HHS perinatal HIV guidelines (based on data obtained from cisgender women) can be applied to transgender and gender diverse people assigned female sex at birth.\n【103】 Health care providers caring for couples planning a pregnancy when one or both partners are diagnosed with HIV infection may contact the National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448-8765) for clinical consultation (HHS [perinatal] 2021).\n【104】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【105】 Rilpivirine has moderate to high placental transfer.\n【106】 No increased risk of overall teratogenic effects has been observed following first trimester exposure according to data collected by the antiretroviral pregnancy registry. Maternal antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm delivery, stillbirth, low birth weight, and small for gestational age infants. Actual risks may be influenced by maternal factors, such as disease severity, gestational age at initiation of therapy, and specific ART regimen; therefore, close fetal monitoring is recommended. Because there is clear benefit to appropriate treatment, maternal ART should not be withheld due to concerns for adverse neonatal outcomes. Long-term follow-up is recommended for all infants exposed to antiretroviral medications; children not diagnosed with HIV infection but who were exposed to ART in utero or as a neonate and develop significant organ system abnormalities of unknown etiology (particularly of the CNS or heart) should be evaluated for potential metabolic dysfunction.\n【107】 The Health and Human Services (HHS) perinatal HIV guidelines consider oral rilpivirine an alternative ART for pregnant patients with HIV infection who are antiretroviral naive, who have had ART therapy in the past but are restarting, or who require a new ART regimen (due to poor tolerance or poor virologic response of current regimen). Patients who become pregnant while taking rilpivirine may continue if viral suppression is effective and the regimen is well tolerated.\n【108】 The HHS perinatal HIV guidelines recommend rilpivirine as a component in alternative regimens for initial use in antiretroviral-naive pregnant patients with a pretreatment HIV RNA ≤100,000 copies/mL and CD4 cell count ≥200 cells/mm3.\n【109】 The pharmacokinetics of rilpivirine in pregnancy are highly variable. Concentrations of rilpivirine may decrease in the second and third trimesters, however, use of higher doses has not been studied. Viral loads should be monitored more frequently in pregnant patients taking standard doses of rilpivirine.\n【110】 ART is recommended for all pregnant people with HIV infection to maximize their health, maintain the viral load below the limit of detection and reduce the risk of perinatal transmission. Therapy should be individualized following a discussion of the potential risks and benefits of treatment during pregnancy. Patients on fully suppressive regimens prior to pregnancy generally may continue the same regimen considering known pregnancy outcomes and pharmacokinetic data. Monitoring of patients who are pregnant is more frequent than in patients who are not pregnant. ART initiated during pregnancy can be modified after delivery. In most cases, recommendations from the HHS perinatal HIV guidelines (based on data obtained from cisgender women) can be applied to transgender and gender diverse people assigned female sex at birth.\n【111】 Health care providers caring for pregnant patients with HIV infection and their infants may contact the National Perinatal HIV Hotline (1-888-448-8765) for clinical consultation (HHS [perinatal] 2021).\n【112】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【113】 It is not known if rilpivirine is present in breast milk.\n【114】 Maternal or infant antiretroviral therapy does not completely eliminate the risk of postnatal HIV transmission. In addition, multiclass-resistant virus has been detected in breastfeeding infants despite maternal therapy. In the United States, where formula is usually accessible, affordable, safe, and sustainable, and the risk of infant mortality due to diarrhea and respiratory infections is low, the Health and Human Services perinatal HIV guidelines do not recommend breastfeeding for patients with HIV infection when safer infant feeding options are available.\n【115】 Information is available for counseling and managing patients with HIV infection who are considering breastfeeding (1-888-448-8765). In most cases, recommendations from the HHS perinatal HIV guidelines (based on data obtained from cisgender women) can be applied to transgender and gender diverse people assigned female sex at birth (HHS [perinatal] 2021).\n【116】 Dietary Considerations\n【117】 Take with a normal- to high-calorie meal. Administration with a protein supplement drink alone does not increase absorption.\n【118】 Monitoring Parameters\n【119】 Cholesterol, triglycerides, hepatic transaminases; signs of skin rash, fever, and/or hypersensitivity reactions, signs and symptoms of infection\n【120】 Mechanism of Action\n【121】 As a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, rilpivirine has activity against HIV-1 by binding to reverse transcriptase. It consequently blocks the RNA-dependent and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities, including HIV-1 replication. It does not require intracellular phosphorylation for antiviral activity.\n【122】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【123】 Absorption: Increased 40% with a meal (normal-to-high calorie)\n【124】 Protein binding: 99.7% (primarily albumin)\n【125】 Metabolism: Hepatic, primarily by CYP3A4\n【126】 Half-life elimination: ~50 hours\n【127】 Time to peak, plasma: 4 to 5 hours\n【128】 Excretion: Feces (85%, ~25% as unchanged drug); urine (~6%; <1% as unchanged drug)\n【129】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【130】 Altered kidney function: Exposure was similar in HIV-1-infected subjects with mild renal impairment relative to HIV-1–infected subjects with healthy renal function; no dose adjustment is required. There is limited information regarding the pharmacokinetics in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment or in patients with ESRD. Concentrations may be increased because of alteration of drug absorption, distribution, and metabolism secondary to renal dysfunction. The potential impact is not expected to be of clinical relevance for subjects with moderate renal impairment; no dose adjustment is required.\n【131】 Hepatic function impairment: The multiple-dose exposure was 47% higher in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and 5% higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment; no dose adjustment is required. Rilpivirine has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment.\n【132】 Brand Names: International\n【133】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Rilpivirine  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/rilpivirine-drug-information?search=%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E4%B8%8E%E6%97%A9%E4%BA%A7%E6%9C%89%E5%85%B3%E7%9A%84%E7%9A%AE%E8%82%A4%E7%96%BE%E6%82%A3&source=search_result&selectedTitle=149%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:02:04"}

SCA in the apparently normal heart is an uncommon occurrence, accounting for only 5 to 10 percent of SCA cases.   \"Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest\".)\n【2】 Some causes of SCA in patients with apparently normal hearts have been identified and include:\n【3】 The epidemiology and pathogenesis of the Brugada syndrome will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, evaluation, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of the Brugada syndrome, along with a discussion of the other causes of SCA in apparently normal hearts, are discussed elsewhere.   \"Approach to sudden cardiac arrest in the absence of apparent structural heart disease\" and  \"Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation\" and  \"Brugada syndrome or pattern: Management and approach to screening of relatives\".)\n【4】 DEFINITION — The Brugada syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder with variable expression characterized by abnormal findings on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) in conjunction with an increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden cardiac death . Typically, the ECG findings consist of a pseudo-right bundle branch block and persistent ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V2 (waveform 1), although isolated cases have described similar findings involving the inferior ECG leads .\n【5】 Brugada pattern versus Brugada syndrome — Two terms, distinguished by the presence or absence of symptoms, have been used to describe patients with the typical ECG findings of a pseudo-right bundle branch block and persistent ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V2:\n【6】 Persons with either the Brugada pattern or the Brugada syndrome can have identical findings on the surface ECG.   \"Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation\", section on '12-lead ECG'.)\n【7】 EPIDEMIOLOGY\n【8】 Prevalence — The prevalence of the asymptomatic Brugada ECG pattern has been evaluated in a number of different populations and appears to be between 0.1 and 1 percent depending upon the population studied . The prevalence of symptomatic Brugada syndrome is significantly lower than the prevalence of the Brugada pattern but is less well studied .\n【9】 Studies in heterogeneous populations suggest that the majority of affected individuals are of Asian descent, with the highest prevalence in Southeast Asia .\n【10】 The prevalence of Brugada syndrome among patients with Brugada pattern ECGs has not been well studied, but a meta-analysis of 30 published reports of patients with Brugada pattern ECGs demonstrated a 10 percent event rate at 2.5 years . The prevalence of the Brugada pattern is much greater in patients who present with apparent idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF; 3 to 24 percent in one series of 37 patients, depending upon the diagnostic criteria used) .   \"Approach to sudden cardiac arrest in the absence of apparent structural heart disease\", section on 'Idiopathic VF'.)\n【11】 Male predominance — The Brugada ECG pattern is more common in men than in women, with estimates ranging from 2 to 9 times more likely in men .\n【12】 Reasons for the prominent male predominance in an autosomal dominant disorder are unclear. Animal models suggest that the impact of testosterone on ion currents, particularly outward potassium currents, may contribute to the increased incidence of clinical manifestations of Brugada syndrome in males .  'Genetics' below.)\n【13】 Age at diagnosis — Brugada pattern ECG and Brugada syndrome are usually diagnosed in adulthood. In two of the larger series of patients, which combined those with Brugada pattern ECGs as well as those with symptomatic Brugada syndrome, the average patient age was 41 years .\n【14】 However, Brugada syndrome can be diagnosed in children. A single-center case series from Italy of 43 patients younger than 12 years reported a higher incidence of malignant arrhythmia events in patients with syncope (37.5 percent) than in patients without syncope (0 percent). No significant difference in outcomes was observed in patients with drug- or fever-induced type 1 pattern versus spontaneous, or between males and females in this young population followed for a mean of four years .\n【15】 Association with schizophrenia — Patients with schizophrenia appear significantly more likely to have Brugada pattern ECGs than the general population. Among a cohort of 275 patients with schizophrenia (with two separate cohorts of nonschizophrenic patients serving as control groups), Brugada pattern ECGs were significantly more common (11.6 percent of patients with schizophrenia versus 1.1 and 2.4 percent of the cohorts without schizophrenia, respectively), with no significant impact of antipsychotic medications with sodium channel blocking activity used to treat schizophrenia . The clinical relevance of this association remains undetermined, but there may be an association between this finding and the risk of sudden death in patients with schizophrenia.   \"Schizophrenia in adults: Epidemiology and pathogenesis\" and  \"Schizophrenia in adults: Clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis\".)\n【16】 PATHOGENESIS — A variety of factors may contribute to the electrocardiographic and clinical manifestations of Brugada syndrome including mutations in the cardiac sodium channel SCN genes, right ventricular (RV) abnormalities, autonomic tone, fever, and the use of cocaine and certain psychotropic drugs.\n【17】 Genetics — The Brugada syndrome demonstrates autosomal dominant inheritance with variable expression . Genetic analysis has led to the identification of purportedly causative mutations in the SCN genes SCN5A and SCN10A, encoding subunits of a cardiac sodium channel. Reasons for the variable expression of Brugada syndrome are not completely understood, although compound heterozygosity (manifestation of a recessive disease due to two different mutations in the same gene) had been described in one family .\n【18】 Sodium channel genes — The defective myocardial sodium channels reduce sodium inflow currents, thereby reducing the duration of normal action potentials. In the RV outflow tract (RVOT) epicardium, there is a prominent transient outward current, called Ito, which causes marked shortening of the action potential in the setting of reduced sodium inflow .\n【19】 The relationship between sodium channel abnormalities and ST segment elevation is not fully understood. The ventricular myocardium is composed of at least three electrophysiologically distinct cell types:\n【20】 The ST segment elevation and T wave inversions seen in the right precordial leads in Brugada pattern ECGs are thought to be due to an alteration in the action potential in the epicardial and possibly the M cells, but not the endocardial cells . The resulting dispersion of repolarization across the ventricular wall, which on noninvasive ECG mapping is isolated in the RVOT, results in a transmural voltage gradient that is manifested in the electrocardiogram as ST segment elevation . In addition, noninvasive ECG mapping has also shown evidence of an arrhythmogenic substrate in the RVOT with delayed activation, slow conduction, and steep repolarization gradients between the RVOT and the rest of the RV . This substrate may predispose to local reentry and ventricular arrhythmias.\n【21】 SCN5A — Mutations in SCN5A, the gene that encodes the Nav1.5 subunit of the cardiac sodium channel gene, have been found in 15 to 30 percent of families with Brugada syndrome . The gene locus is on chromosome 3p21-24.\n【22】 The SCN5A mutations  . A critical appraisal of all candidate genes identified SCN5a as the only gene with definitive evidence for causation of Brugada syndrome .\n【23】 SCN10A — Mutations in SCN10A, the gene that encodes the Nav1.8 subunit of the cardiac sodium channel gene, have been reported in 17 percent of Brugada syndrome probands, which is comparable to the 20 percent of probands found to have SCN5A mutations . Coexpression of the mutant SCN10A gene with wild-type SCN5A causes a major loss of function of the sodium channel, with reduced current and slower recovery from inactivation. A longer PR interval, longer QRS duration, and higher incidence of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death were noted in patients carrying mutations of SCN10A compared with gene-negative patients with Brugada syndrome.\n【24】 Other sodium channel mutations — Other mutations that decrease the sodium channel current have been identified in isolated kindreds with Brugada syndrome. These include a mutation in SCN1B, an accessory subunit that interacts with the sodium channel and is also associated with conduction system disease , and a mutation in GPD1-L, a gene that affects trafficking of the sodium channel .\n【25】 Related disorders with SCN mutations — Mutations in the SCN5 gene have also been associated with other electrophysiologic abnormalities:\n【26】 The differences in clinical manifestations are probably due to differences in the electrophysiologic abnormalities induced by the specific mutations . Certain SCN5A and SCN10A mutations have been associated with an \"overlap\" syndrome, with affected patients exhibiting SND or complete heart block as well as Brugada syndrome . Patients with longer PR intervals may be more likely to have a SNC10A mutation .   \"Etiology of atrioventricular block\", section on 'Familial disease' and  \"Congenital long QT syndrome: Pathophysiology and genetics\", section on 'Type 3 LQTS (LQT3)' and  \"Genetics of dilated cardiomyopathy\" and  \"Sinus node dysfunction: Epidemiology, etiology, and natural history\", section on 'Childhood and familial disease' and  \"Early repolarization\".)\n【27】 Non-sodium channel genes — Since only a minority of affected families have an identified abnormality of SCN, it is possible that additional genetic abnormalities may produce the phenotypic characteristics of Brugada syndrome.\n【28】 Microscopic structural abnormalities and fibrosis — Brugada syndrome is not usually associated with structural heart disease. Standard cardiac testing, including echocardiography, stress testing, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging often reveal no abnormalities. However, it is probably more accurate to categorize Brugada syndrome as a disorder that occurs in hearts that are apparently normal since there is some evidence that subtle structural or microscopic abnormalities occur, including dilation of the RVOT and localized inflammation and fibrosis .\n【29】 Supporting a pathogenic role of fibrosis in Brugada syndrome, a mouse model of heterozygous SCN5A knockout revealed age-dependent fibrosis and marked slowing of conduction velocity in the RV . Similarly, evaluation of an explanted heart from a transplant recipient with Brugada syndrome revealed microscopic fibrosis and conduction abnormalities .\n【30】 Evidence of microscopic abnormalities in Brugada syndrome comes from a series of 18 patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsy . Although noninvasive evaluation was normal in each patient, all had evidence of microscopic structural abnormalities, including signs of RV myocarditis in 14. The ECG changes resolved at follow-up in 8 of the 14 patients with signs of RV myocarditis, raising the possibility that the Brugada pattern ECG seen in these patients at presentation may have been a manifestation of RV myocarditis rather than an intrinsic cardiac ion channel abnormality.\n【31】 A study of six post-mortem hearts from patients thought to have Brugada syndrome and six patients undergoing epicardial ablation via thoracotomy for Brugada syndrome demonstrated further evidence for fibrosis in the pathogenesis of Brugada syndrome. These patients showed increased collagen and fibrosis in the RVOT epicardium and reduced Connexin 43 signal in the RVOT. Fibrosis was located in areas of abnormal potentials during in vivo mapping .\n【32】 Ventricular arrhythmias and phase 2 reentry — Ventricular arrhythmias may result from the heterogeneity of myocardial refractory periods in the RV. This heterogeneity arises from the presence of both normal and abnormal sodium channels in the same tissue, and from the differential impact of the sodium current in the three layers of the myocardium .  'Sodium channel genes' above.)\n【33】 Within the epicardium, the juxtaposition of myocytes with different refractory periods can produce the triggers that initiate sustained arrhythmias (eg, closely-coupled premature beats) via a unique type of reentry called phase two reentry. In cardiac myocytes with defective sodium channels, initial depolarization is blunted (phase zero), and the counterbalancing effect of Ito (phase 1) may be more significant. This phenomenon is more dramatic in the RVOT epicardium where Ito currents are greater. In combination, this results in less initial depolarization and reduced activation of the calcium channels that maintain the depolarized state during phase 2. Thus, phase 2 of the cardiac action potential can be dramatically shortened.\n【34】 The cells with impaired sodium channel function may fail to propagate the action potential, resulting in localized conduction block. However, due to the abbreviation of phase 2, these same cells have a much shorter refractory period and recover excitability before the surrounding cells. The combination of localized conduction block and a shortened refractory period provides the substrate for localized reentry, which, in this case, is referred to as phase 2 reentry. The closely-coupled ventricular premature beats that result from phase 2 reentry may precipitate sustained ventricular arrhythmias. Noninvasive ECG mapping has also revealed delayed activation, slow conduction, and steep repolarization gradients between the RVOT and the rest of the RV, further supporting the role of the RVOT as the location of abnormal electrophysiologic substrate in Brugada syndrome .\n【35】 Autonomic tone — An imbalance between sympathetic and parasympathetic tone may be important in the pathogenesis of Brugada ECG pattern and Brugada syndrome, as suggested by the nocturnal occurrence of the associated tachyarrhythmias and the alteration of typical ECG changes by pharmacologic modulation of autonomic tone .\n【36】 Further support for the role of autonomic dysfunction comes from a study of 17 patients with Brugada syndrome who underwent scanning with iobenguane I-123 (diagnostic), a radiolabeled guanethidine analog that is actively taken up by sympathetic nerve terminals . A segmental reduction in MIBG uptake was seen in 8 of the 17 patients but in none of 10 controls.\n【37】 Augmentation of ST elevation ≥0.05 mV in leads V1-V2 during recovery from exercise is  or asymptomatic Brugada pattern (36 patients), 37 percent had augmentation of ST elevation in exercise recovery, and during follow-up, 44 percent of these patients versus 17 percent of patients without ST augmentation had arrhythmic events . The mechanism may be a response to parasympathetic reactivation during recovery from exercise.\n【38】 Fever — Fever can be a trigger for both induction of Brugada pattern ECG abnormalities and cardiac arrest among persons known to have Brugada pattern ECG or Brugada syndrome. The clinical impact of fever in patients with Brugada pattern ECGs is discussed separately.   \"Brugada syndrome: Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and evaluation\".)\n【39】 Drugs — A 2020 scientific statement from the American Heart Association details drugs associated with the Brugada syndrome .\n【40】 Cocaine abuse — The ECG findings of Brugada pattern can be transiently induced by cocaine use . Cocaine acts like a class I antiarrhythmic agent, producing local anesthetic effects via sodium channel blockade in the heart; this could explain the relation to the Brugada pattern.   \"Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of the cardiovascular complications of cocaine abuse\".)\n【41】 Psychotropic drugs — Other drugs that block cardiac sodium channels have been associated with a transient Brugada pattern ECG, including overdoses with neuroleptic drugs or cyclic antidepressants . In one report, a Brugada pattern was  of a cyclic antidepressant overdose . One patient with the Brugada pattern and one without died of refractory ventricular fibrillation.\n", "title": "Brugada综合征的流行病学和发病机制", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/brugada-syndrome-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis?search=%E5%8F%AF%E5%8D%A1%E5%9B%A0%E4%BE%9D%E8%B5%96%EF%BC%8C%E6%97%A9%E6%9C%9F%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E7%BC%93%E8%A7%A3&source=search_result&selectedTitle=7%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:12:46"}

Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【100】 Sodium Phosphates: Diuretics may enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Sodium Phosphates. Specifically, the risk of acute phosphate nephropathy may be enhanced.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【101】 Tobramycin (Oral Inhalation): Mannitol (Systemic) may enhance the nephrotoxic effect of Tobramycin (Oral Inhalation).  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【102】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【103】 Mannitol crosses the placenta.\n【104】 Outcome information following surgical use in pregnancy is limited; amniotic fluid volume may be decreased (Handlogten 2015; Kazemi 2014).\n【105】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【106】 It is not known if mannitol is present in breast milk.\n【107】 According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother. Other sources consider mannitol to be compatible with breastfeeding (WHO 2002).\n【108】 Monitoring Parameters\n【109】 Kidney function; cardiac and pulmonary function; urine output; intravascular volume status; serum electrolytes, serum osmolality (measured); osmolar gap; acid-base status; serum glucose; intracranial pressure (if applicable). Monitor infusion site.\n【110】 For treatment of cerebral edema and intracranial pressure, some suggest monitoring osmolar gap as a surrogate marker for mannitol accumulation to evaluate for the risk of acute kidney injury (NCCS [Cook 2020]). Others suggest maintaining serum osmolality <320 mOsm/kg due to the potential risk of acute kidney injury; however, this threshold may be exceeded if clinically necessary (Grape 2012; Rabenstein 2006).\n【111】 Mechanism of Action\n【112】 Produces an osmotic diuresis by increasing the osmotic pressure of glomerular filtrate, which inhibits tubular reabsorption of water and electrolytes and increases urinary output . Mechanism of action in reduction of intracranial pressure (ICP) is less clear. However, it is thought that mannitol reduces ICP by reducing blood viscosity which transiently increases cerebral blood flow and oxygen transport and constricts pial arterioles. This in turn reduces cerebral blood volume and ICP. Furthermore, mannitol reduces ICP by withdrawing water from the brain parenchyma and excretes water in the urine (Allen 1998; BTF [Carney 2017]).\n【113】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【114】 Onset of action: Diuresis: 1 to 3 hours; Reduction in intracranial pressure: ~15 to 30 minutes.\n【115】 Duration: Reduction in intracranial pressure: 1.5 to 6 hours.\n【116】 Distribution: 17 L; remains confined to extracellular space (except in extreme concentrations); does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier (generally, penetration is low).\n【117】 Metabolism: Minimally hepatic to glycogen.\n【118】 Half-life elimination: 0.5 to 2.5 hours; ~36 hours in acute kidney injury and end-stage kidney failure.\n【119】 Excretion: Urine (~80% as unchanged drug).\n【120】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【121】 Altered kidney function: Elimination half-life is ~36 hours in patients with acute kidney injury and end-stage kidney failure. In patients with kidney impairment receiving hemodialysis, half-life elimination reduced to ~6 hours; in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis, half-life elimination reduced to ~21 hours.\n【122】 Brand Names: International\n【123】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Mannitol (systemic)  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/mannitol-systemic-drug-information?search=%E9%A2%85%E5%86%85%E5%8D%A0%E4%BD%8D%E6%80%A7%E7%97%85%E5%8F%98&source=search_result&selectedTitle=124%7E124&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:27:38"}

HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis.\n【40】 Contact dermatitis: Allergic contact dermatitis can occur and is usually diagnosed by failure to heal rather than clinical exacerbation; discontinue use if irritation occurs and treat appropriately.\n【41】 Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may also increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to vaccines. Exposure to varicella zoster (chickenpox) should be avoided; corticosteroids should not be used to treat ocular herpes simplex.\n【42】 Ocular effects: Topical corticosteroids, including betamethasone, may increase the risk of posterior subcapsular cataracts and glaucoma. Monitor for ocular symptoms. Avoid contact with eyes.\n【43】 Skin reactions: Discontinue if skin irritation or contact dermatitis occurs; do not use in patients with decreased skin circulation.\n【44】 Systemic effects: Topical corticosteroids may be absorbed percutaneously. Absorption of topical corticosteroids may cause manifestations of Cushing syndrome (rare), hyperglycemia, or glycosuria. Absorption is increased by the use of occlusive dressings, application to denuded skin, application to large surface areas, or prolonged use.\n【45】 Pediatric: Use of augmented formulations in patients <13 years of age is not recommended. For all formulations, children may absorb proportionally larger amounts after topical application and may be more prone to systemic effects. HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, and Cushing syndrome have been reported in children receiving topical corticosteroids. Prolonged use may affect growth velocity; growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients. Use lowest dose possible for shortest period of time to avoid HPA axis suppression.\n【46】 Appropriate use: For topical use only; avoid contact with eyes. Not for oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use. Do not use occlusive dressings on weeping or exudative lesions and general caution with occlusive dressings should be observed; adverse effects may be increased. In the presence of a fungal or bacterial dermatologic infection, institute appropriate antifungal or antibacterial therapy. If the infection does not resolve promptly, discontinue use until the infection has been adequately controlled.\n【47】 Augmented (eg, very high potency) products: Use of augmented formulations in patients <13 years of age is not recommended. Not for treatment of rosacea, perioral dermatitis, or if skin atrophy is present at treatment site; not for facial, groin, axillary, oral, ophthalmic, or intravaginal use; not for use in a diapered area. Avoid concurrent use of other corticosteroids.\n【48】 Flammable contents: Foam contains flammable propellants. Avoid fire, flame and smoking during and immediately following administration.\n【49】 Patch [Canadian product]: Has not been studied in psoriasis of the face, scalp or intertriginous areas; contains methyl and propyl parahydroxybenzoate, which may cause hypersensitivity (sometimes delayed).\n【50】 Discontinuation of therapy: Withdraw therapy with gradual tapering of dose by reducing the frequency of application or substitution of a less potent steroid.\n【51】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【52】 The extent of percutaneous absorption is dependent on several factors, including epidermal integrity (intact vs abraded skin), formulation, age of the patient, prolonged duration of use, and the use of occlusive dressings. Percutaneous absorption of topical steroids is increased in neonates (especially preterm neonates), infants, and young children. Infants and small children may be more susceptible to HPA axis suppression, intracranial hypertension, Cushing syndrome, or other systemic toxicities due to larger skin surface area to body mass ratio. HPA axis suppression was observed in 32% of infants and children (age range: 3 months to 12 years) being treated with betamethasone dipropionate cream (0.05%) for atopic dermatitis in an open-label trial (n=60); the incidence was greater younger patients vs older children (mean reported incidence for age ranges: ≤1 year: 50%; 2 to 8 years: 32% to 38%; 9 to 12 years: 17%).\n【53】 Some dosage forms may contain propylene glycol; in neonates large amounts of propylene glycol delivered orally, intravenously (eg, >3,000 mg/day), or topically have been associated with potentially fatal toxicities which can include metabolic acidosis, seizures, renal failure, and CNS depression; toxicities have also been reported in children and adults including hyperosmolality, lactic acidosis, seizures and respiratory depression; use caution (AAP 1997; Shehab 2009).\n【54】 Dosage Forms: US\n【55】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

In general, the use of topical corticosteroids is not associated with a significant risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, there may be an increased risk of low birth weight infants following maternal use of potent or very potent topical products, especially in high doses, although this risk is likely to be low (Andersson 2021; Chi 2015; Chi 2017).\n【146】 When first-line treatments, such as emollients, are insufficient, topical corticosteroids may be used for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in pregnant patients (Vestergaard 2019). Topical corticosteroids are classified by potency; the medication and formulation (eg, cream, gel, and/or salt form) contribute to the potency classification (Oakley 2021; Stacey 2021; Tadicherla 2009). In general, use of the least potent product in limited amounts is recommended during pregnancy. Mild to moderate potency corticosteroids are preferred; potent to very potent topical corticosteroids should only be used as alternative therapy in limited amounts under obstetrical care. Pregnant patients should avoid application of topical corticosteroids to areas with high percutaneous absorption (eg, armpit, skin folds, vulva) (Chi 2017), and caution should be used when applying to areas prone to striae formation (eg, abdomen, breast, thighs) (Vestergaard 2019).\n【147】 Breastfeeding Considerations\n【148】 It is not known if systemic absorption following topical administration results in detectable quantities of betamethasone in breast milk.\n【149】 Systemic corticosteroids are present in breast milk. According to the manufacturer, the decision to breastfeed during therapy should consider the risk of infant exposure, the benefits of breastfeeding to the infant, and benefits of treatment to the mother; however, topical corticosteroids are generally considered acceptable for use in patients who are breastfeeding (Butler 2014; WHO 2002).\n【150】 Avoid application of topical corticosteroids to the nipple and areola area until breastfeeding ceases; hypertension was noted in a breastfed infant when a high potency topical corticosteroid was applied to the nipple (AAD-NPF [Elmets 2021]; Butler 2014; Leachman 2006). If needed, apply topical corticosteroids immediately after breastfeeding, then clean nipples prior to the next feeding (Vestergaard 2019).\n【151】 Monitoring Parameters\n【152】 HPA axis suppression and adrenal insufficiency, especially in children or with augmented formulation use; ocular symptoms. Foam, gel, lotion (augmented), and ointment (augmented): reassess if no improvement after 2 weeks of treatment.\n【153】 Mechanism of Action\n【154】 Topical corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. May depress the formation, release, and activity of endogenous chemical mediators of inflammation (kinins, histamine, liposomal enzymes, prostaglandins) through the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins) and sequential inhibition of the release of arachidonic acid. Betamethasone has intermediate to very high range potency (dosage-form dependent).\n【155】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【156】 Absorption: Topical corticosteroids are absorbed percutaneously. The extent of absorption is dependent on several factors, including epidermal integrity (intact vs abraded skin), formulation, age of the patient, prolonged duration of use, and the use of occlusive dressings. Percutaneous absorption of topical steroids is increased in neonates (especially preterm neonates), infants, and young children.\n【157】 Metabolism: Hepatic\n【158】 Excretion: Urine and bile\n【159】 Brand Names: International\n【160】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Betamethasone (topical)  Drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://121.4.192.30:8091//contents/betamethasone-topical-drug-information?search=%E7%BA%A2%E6%96%91%E6%AF%9B%E7%BB%86%E8%A1%80%E7%AE%A1%E6%89%A9%E5%BC%A0%E5%9E%8B%E7%8E%AB%E7%91%B0%E7%97%A4%E7%96%AE&source=search_result&selectedTitle=66%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:09:06"}

concurrent use (regularly/intermittently) of organic nitrates in any form (eg, nitroglycerin, isosorbide dinitrate); concomitant use of riociguat (a guanylate cyclase stimulator).\n【68】 According to the manufacturers of protease inhibitors (atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, tipranavir): Concurrent use with a protease inhibitor regimen when sildenafil is used for pulmonary artery hypertension.\n【69】 Significant drug interactions exist, requiring dose/frequency adjustment or avoidance. Consult drug interactions database for more information.\n【70】 Viagra: Prior episode of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION).\n【71】 Revatio: Prior episode of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION); concurrent use with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir); pulmonary hypertension secondary to sickle cell anemia; severe hepatic impairment; recent history of stroke or MI, or life-threatening arrhythmia; coronary artery disease causing unstable angina; severe hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg) at initiation.\n【72】 Warnings/Precautions\n【73】 Color discrimination: May cause dose-related impairment of color discrimination. Use caution in patients with retinitis pigmentosa; a minority have genetic disorders of retinal phosphodiesterases (no safety information available).\n【74】 Hypotension: Caution patients that concurrent use of alcohol, particularly in larger quantities, may increase the risk for orthostatic hypotension, dizziness, tachycardia, and headache. Recommend limiting any alcohol use to smaller quantities and refraining from such combined use as possible.\n【75】 Anatomical penis deformation: Use with caution in patients with anatomical deformation of the penis (angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie disease).\n【76】 Bleeding disorders: Use with caution in patients with bleeding disorders; safety has not been established. In vitro studies have suggested a decreased effect on platelet aggregation.\n【77】 Cardiovascular disease: Use with caution in patients with hypotension (<90/50 mm Hg); uncontrolled hypertension (>170/110 mm Hg); life-threatening arrhythmias, stroke or MI within the last 6 months; cardiac failure or coronary artery disease causing unstable angina; safety and efficacy have not been studied in these patients. Use caution in patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction (eg, aortic stenosis). Patients should be hemodynamically stable prior to initiating therapy at the lowest possible dose. There is a degree of cardiac risk associated with sexual activity; therefore, health care providers should consider the cardiovascular status of their patients prior to initiating any treatment for erectile dysfunction.\n【78】 Conditions predisposing to priapism: Use with caution in patients who have conditions which may predispose them to priapism (sickle cell anemia, multiple myeloma, leukemia). All patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if erection persists >4 hours.\n【79】 Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment; dose adjustment may be required.\n【80】 Peptic ulcer disease: Use with caution in patients with active peptic ulcer disease; safety has not been established.\n【81】 Pulmonary arterial hypertension: Sudden cessation of sildenafil monotherapy could result in an exacerbation of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Efficacy in adult patients determined through short-term (12 to 16 week) studies; safety of longer-term use is unclear. A long-term use trial in pediatric patients showed increased mortality in the higher dose groups (20 to 80 mg [depending upon weight] 3 times per day) after 2 years of use, which was related to disease progression (Barst 2012; Barst 2014; manufacturer's labeling).\n【82】 Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease: Use in patients with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is not recommended (has not been studied); if pulmonary edema occurs when treating PAH, consider the possibility of PVOD.\n【83】 Renal impairment: Use with caution in patients with renal impairment; dose adjustment may be needed.\n【84】 Sickle cell anemia: Treatment of pulmonary hypertension with sildenafil in this patient population may lead to more hospitalizations for management of vaso-occlusive crises. The effectiveness and safety of sildenafil have not been established in pulmonary hypertension secondary to sickle cell disease.\n【85】 Nitrates: Use of sildenafil is contraindicated in patients currently taking nitrate preparations. However, when nitrate administration becomes medically necessary, American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines support administration of nitrates only if 24 hours have elapsed after use of sildenafil (ACC/AHA [Amsterdam 2014]; ACCF/AHA [O'Gara 2013]); may need to wait longer than 24 hours in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction.\n【86】 Older adult: Use with caution; dose adjustment may be required.\n【87】 Benzyl alcohol and derivatives: Some dosage forms may contain sodium benzoate/benzoic acid; benzoic acid (benzoate) is a metabolite of benzyl alcohol; large amounts of benzyl alcohol (≥99 mg/kg/day) have been associated with a potentially fatal toxicity (“gasping syndrome”) in neonates; the “gasping syndrome” consists of metabolic acidosis, respiratory distress, gasping respirations, CNS dysfunction (including convulsions, intracranial hemorrhage), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse (AAP [\"Inactive\" 1997]; CDC 1982); some data suggests that benzoate displaces bilirubin from protein binding sites (Ahlfors 2001); avoid or use dosage forms containing benzyl alcohol derivative with caution in neonates.

Management: Monitor for increased effects/toxicity with concomitant oral use.\n【179】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【180】 Sildenafil was shown to cross the placenta in an ex vivo placenta perfusion study (Russo 2018).\n【181】 Because sildenafil causes vasodilation in the uterus, it is currently under study for various obstetric uses (Dunn 2016; Dunn 2017; Groom 2019; Maged 2018; Maher 2019; Pels 2017; Sharp 2018). However, due to adverse events in the newborn observed using preliminary data from a study evaluating sildenafil for fetal growth restriction, use of sildenafil in pregnant women outside of a controlled clinical study is not currently recommended (Groom 2018; Levin 2019).\n【182】 Information related to the use of sildenafil for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in pregnant women is limited (Cartago 2014; Hsu 2011; Lim 2019; Wollein 2016). Untreated PAH in pregnancy increases the risk for heart failure, stroke, preterm delivery, and maternal/fetal death. Women with PAH are encouraged to avoid pregnancy (McLaughlin 2009; Taichman 2014).\n【183】 Monitoring Parameters\n【184】 Heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, PaO2, oxygenation index.\n【185】 Mechanism of Action\n【186】 Erectile dysfunction: Does not directly cause penile erections but affects the response to sexual stimulation. The physiologic mechanism of erection of the penis involves release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation. NO then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum. Sildenafil enhances the effect of NO by inhibiting phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5), which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum; when sexual stimulation causes local release of NO, inhibition of PDE-5 by sildenafil causes increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in smooth muscle relaxation and inflow of blood to the corpus cavernosum; at recommended doses, it has no effect in the absence of sexual stimulation.\n【187】 Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): Inhibits phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5) in smooth muscle of pulmonary vasculature where PDE-5 is responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Increased cGMP concentration results in pulmonary vasculature relaxation; vasodilation in the pulmonary bed and the systemic circulation (to a lesser degree) may occur.\n【188】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【189】 Onset of action: Erectile dysfunction: ~60 minutes.\n【190】 Peak effect: Decrease blood pressure: Oral: 1 to 2 hours.\n【191】 Duration: Erectile dysfunction: 2 to 4 hours; Decrease blood pressure: <8 hours.\n【192】 Absorption: Rapid; slower with a high-fat meal; tablet and suspension are bioequivalent.\n【193】 Distribution: Distributes into tissues.\n【194】 Vd total:\n【195】 Term neonates: 19.8 to 22.4 L (Mukherjee 2009; Rhee 2022).\n【196】 Vdss: Adults: 105 L.\n【197】 Protein binding, plasma:\n【198】 Term neonates: Sildenafil: 93.9% ± 2.5%; N-desmethyl metabolite: 92% ± 3% (Mukherjee 2009).\n【199】 Adults: Sildenafil and N-desmethyl metabolite: ~96%.\n【200】 Metabolism: Hepatic via CYP3A4 (major) and CYP2C9 (minor route); major metabolite (UK-103320 or desmethylsildenafil) is formed via N-desmethylation pathway and has 50% of the potency of sildenafil.\n【201】 Bioavailability: Oral: Mean: 41%; range: 25% to 63%; may be higher in patients with PAH compared to healthy volunteers; Note: A 10 mg dose of the injection is predicted to have an effect equal to a 20 mg oral dose taking into consideration the parent drug and active metabolite.\n【202】 Half-life elimination:\n【203】 Sildenafil: Terminal:\n【204】 Term neonates (Mukherjee 2009):\n【205】 PNA 1 day: 55.9 hours.\n【206】 PNA 7 days: 47.7 hours.\n【207】 Adults: 4 hours.\n【208】 Active N-desmethyl metabolite: Terminal:\n【209】 Neonates: 11.9 hours (Mukherjee 2009).\n【210】 Time to peak: Oral: Fasting: 30 to 120 minutes (median 60 minutes); delayed by 60 minutes with a high-fat meal.\n【211】 Excretion: Feces (~80%, as metabolites); urine (~13%).\n【212】 Clearance: Decreased in patients with hepatic cirrhosis or severe renal impairment; clearance may be lower in patients with PAH compared to normal volunteers. Sildenafil clearance in newborns is significantly decreased compared to adults, but approaches adult (allometrically scaled) values by the first week of life (Mukherjee 2009). Clearance of N-desmethyl active metabolite is decreased in patients with severe renal impairment.\n【213】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【214】 Altered kidney function: Severe renal impairment is associated with increased plasma levels.\n【215】 Hepatic function impairment: Hepatic impairment is associated with increased plasma levels.\n【216】 Older adult: Age 65 years or older is associated with increased plasma levels.\n【217】 Brand Names: International\n【218】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Sildenafil  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://office.sugh.net:9444//contents/sildenafil-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E5%8D%95%E7%BA%AF%E6%94%B6%E7%BC%A9%E6%9C%9F%E7%BB%A7%E5%8F%91%E6%80%A7%E9%AB%98%E8%A1%80%E5%8E%8B&source=search_result&selectedTitle=115%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:10:21"}

This may be caused by increased pressure within the colon or by hardened particles of stool, which can become lodged within the diverticulum.\n【5】 Diverticular bleeding — Diverticular bleeding occurs when a small artery located within a diverticulum is eroded and bleeds into the colon.\n【6】 Is bleeding with a bowel movement normal? — It is not normal to  but some of which are serious and require immediate treatment. Anyone who  in adults (Beyond the Basics)\".)\n【7】 DIVERTICULOSIS AND DIVERTICULITIS DIAGNOSIS — Diverticulosis is often found during tests performed for other reasons.\n【8】 TREATMENT\n【9】 Diverticulosis — People with diverticulosis who do not have symptoms do not require treatment. However, most clinicians recommend increasing fiber in the diet, which can help to bulk the stools and possibly prevent the development of new diverticula, diverticulitis, or diverticular bleeding. Fiber is not proven to prevent these conditions in all patients but may help to control recurrent episodes in some.\n【10】 Increase fiber — Fruits and vegetables are a good source of fiber\n【11】 because of concern that these foods could cause an episode of diverticulitis. However, this belief is completely unproven. We do not suggest that patients with diverticulosis avoid seeds, corn, or nuts.\n【12】 Diverticulitis — Treatment of diverticulitis depends upon how severe your symptoms are.\n【13】 Home treatment — If your disease is mild and you are otherwise healthy, you might be treated at home. This usually involves a liquid diet and pain-relieving medication. However, if you develop one or more of the following signs or symptoms, you should seek immediate medical attention:\n【14】 Hospital treatment — If you have severe disease, you are not in good health, or your symptoms do not get better in two to three days, you might need to be hospitalized for treatment. Initially in the hospital, you will not eat or drink anything; you will receive fluids and antibiotics given through a vein (by IV).\n【15】 Surgery — If you develop a generalized infection in the abdomen (peritonitis), you will usually require an emergency operation. A two-part operation may be necessary in some cases.\n【16】 Surgery versus medical therapy — An operation to remove the diseased area of the colon may be necessary if you do not improve with medical therapy. After an episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis, elective surgery is generally not required as the risk of another attack or requiring emergency surgery is low. However, patients with persistent symptoms attributable to diverticulitis, a history of complicated diverticulitis, or a compromised immune system should be evaluated for possible surgery to prevent another attack. In such patients, another attack has been associated with a higher risk of complications or death. Of course, the decision will also depend in part upon your other medical conditions and ability to undergo surgery.\n【17】 After diverticulitis resolves — After an episode of diverticulitis resolves, if you have not had a recent colonoscopy, the entire length of the colon should be evaluated to determine the extent of disease and to rule out the presence of abnormal lesions such as polyps or cancer. Recommended tests include one of the following: colonoscopy, barium enema and sigmoidoscopy, or CT colonography to rule out concomitant disease.   \"\n【18】 Diverticular bleeding — Most cases of diverticular bleeding resolve on their own. However, some people will need further testing or treatment to stop bleeding, which may include a colonoscopy, angiography (a treatment that blocks off the bleeding artery), bleeding scan, or surgery.\n【19】 DIVERTICULAR DISEASE PROGNOSIS\n【20】 Diverticulosis — Over time, diverticulosis may cause no problems or it may cause episodes of bleeding and/or diverticulitis. Approximately 15 to 25 percent of people with diverticulosis will develop diverticulitis, while 5 to 15 percent will develop diverticular bleeding.\n【21】 Diverticulitis — Approximately 85 percent of people with uncomplicated diverticulitis will respond to medical treatment, while approximately 15 percent of patients will need an operation. After successful treatment for a first attack of diverticulitis, one-third of patients will remain asymptomatic, one-third will have episodic cramps without diverticulitis, and one-third will go on to have a second attack of diverticulitis.\n【22】 WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION — Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.\n【23】 The Basics — The Basics patient education pieces answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.\n【24】 Beyond the Basics — Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.\n【25】 Professional level information — Professional level articles are designed to keep doctors and other health professionals up-to-date on the latest medical findings. These articles are thorough, long, and complex, and they contain multiple references to the research on which they are based. Professional level articles are best for people who are comfortable with a lot of medical terminology and who want to read the same materials their doctors are reading.\n", "title": "Patient education  Diverticular disease (Beyond the Basics)", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/diverticular-disease-beyond-the-basics?search=%E5%85%B7%E6%9C%89%E7%BB%93%E8%82%A0%E9%80%A0%E5%8F%A3&source=search_result&selectedTitle=128%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:08:40"}

It rapidly spread, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 and to characterize it as a pandemic in March 2020. The virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n【2】 OVERVIEW OF TRANSMISSION — Experts agree that transmission occurs through droplets (when virus released in the respiratory secretions of a person with infection makes direct contact with mucous membranes) and through inhalation of aerosolized secretions, which can travel further, remain suspended in air longer, and contain infectious particles that are smaller than typically described for respiratory droplets . However, the relative contribution of each mode of transmission is uncertain . Indirect (secondary) transmission, which occurs when a susceptible person touches a contaminated surface and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth, is also possible but is not thought to be a major route of transmission. More detailed information on the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), including the risk of asymptomatic transmission, is discussed in a separate topic review.   \"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention\", section on 'Transmission'.)\n【3】 SCREENING PRIOR TO AND UPON ENTRY INTO THE HEALTH CARE FACILITY\n【4】 Patients — There are many opportunities to screen patients before and after entry into the health care facility to reduce unnecessary exposures to SARS-CoV-2 infection in the healthcare settings. As examples:\n【5】 Prior to entry – Patients calling their provider with respiratory symptoms can be screened for clinical manifestations consistent with COVID-19 prior to entry into the healthcare facility. Such symptoms include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, myalgias, headache, sore throat, dyspnea, anosmia/hyposmia, congestion or rhinorrhea, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea).   \"COVID-19: Clinical features\".)\n【6】 Many of these patients with signs and symptoms of COVID-19 can be managed from home through telemedicine and will not need to enter a health care facility.   \"COVID-19: Evaluation of adults with acute illness in the outpatient setting\" and  \"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection\", section on 'Infection prevention in the home setting'.)\n【7】 If the patient should be , referral to an urgent care or emergency room may be needed.\n【8】 Upon entry to the health care facility – Patients should be screened for symptoms of COVID-19 upon entry into a health care setting, even if they were screened prior to arrival. In many healthcare settings this is now done through signs and posters informing patients about the symptoms of COVID-19.\n【9】 Efforts should be made to place patients with suspected COVID-19 into private rooms as soon as possible. If an examination room is not immediately available, such patients should not wait among other patients. In this setting, it may be reasonable to have patients wait in a well-ventilated space where patients can be separated by at least six feet, in addition to being masked. Persons accompanying such patients should either be placed in the same private room, outside, or in a waiting room, masked.\n【10】 Patients without symptoms should be asked to inform HCP of any unprotected exposures to a person with COVID-19 within the last 10 days. Patients who have had close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may need to quarantine, be tested, or both.   \"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection\", section on 'Patients who have had an exposure to COVID-19'.)\n【11】 Admission/preprocedural testing – During the COVID-19 pandemic, many institutions have implemented universal nucleic acid testing upon admission to the hospital and prior to elective aerosol-generating procedures and major surgeries. This allows patients with asymptomatic or presymptomatic infection to be identified, even if there are no risk factors for COVID-19.\n【12】 The decision to implement these types of screening programs depends in part upon local infection rates, and must balance the risks and benefits of testing . As an example, preprocedural testing may delay appropriate care, and with the appropriate use of recommended PPE (eg, respirators and eye protection for all aerosol generating procedures), HCP would not be at risk. By contrast, identifying asymptomatic cases via admission testing may be able to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission to other patients, particularly roommates in semi-private rooms .\n【13】 Admission or preprocedural testing is generally not warranted for asymptomatic patients with prior COVID-19 if the patient's onset of illness was within the prior 30 days and they met criteria for discontinuation of precautions\n【14】 More detailed information on COVID-19 testing as well as the use of testing as part of the preoperative evaluation is presented elsewhere.   \"COVID-19: Diagnosis\" and  \"COVID-19: Perioperative risk assessment, preoperative screening and testing, and timing of surgery after infection\", section on 'Preoperative evaluation'.)\n【15】 Visitors — During the COVID-19 pandemic, most hospitals restricted visitors in the health care setting. Over time, there have been fewer restrictions; however, visitors with symptoms or other evidence of infection should not be allowed to enter the health care setting.\n【16】 Health care personnel — The approach to screening health care personnel (HCP) entering the health care setting depends upon the institution's policies. At a minimum, HCP should monitor themselves for symptoms of COVID-19 and stay home if they are ill . They should then contact occupational health for additional guidance. In one report of 48 HCP with confirmed COVID-19, 65 percent reported working for a median of two days while exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 .\n【17】 UNIVERSAL USE OF MASKS — Similar to other prevention strategies, the need for universal masking is dictated by the specific institution, and depends in part on the degree of community transmission. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that universal masking is only required when community transmission levels are high . The use of masks as source control in community settings is presented elsewhere.   \"COVID-19: Epidemiology, virology, and prevention\", section on 'Personal preventive measures'.)\n【18】 Patient and visitors – All patients and visitors should bring or be given well-fitting masks to wear upon entry into the health care setting for universal source control . Masks made from mesh or with exhalation valves or vents should be avoided since they do not provide source control. Patients or visitors wearing one of these masks should be provided with an appropriate alternative.\n【19】 Visitors should be asked to wear a well-fitting mask at all times in the hospital setting.\n【20】 For patients, once they are in an appropriate room (eg, single room with the door closed for patients with suspected COVID-19), they can usually remove their mask. However, patients should be instructed to replace their masks when HCP enter their room. If the patient cannot wear a mask, the HCP should wear a face shield or goggles and a respirator. The use of a respirator and face shield or goggles provides additional protection in the event that a patient cannot or will not wear a mask; this is particularly important in areas with moderate to substantial rates of community SARS-CoV-2 transmission.  'Precautions for those NOT suspected of having COVID-19' below.)\n【21】 Health care personnel – HCP should wear a well-fitting medical mask in the health care setting. Hand hygiene should be performed immediately before and after contact with face masks. These masks provide both source control and respiratory protection. Masks should be worn even when the HCP is not caring for patients.\n【22】 When caring for patients, the type of mask (eg, respirator or medical mask) may depend upon the clinical setting (eg, aerosol-generating procedures, routine care, suspicion for COVID-19) and the degree of community transmission, as discussed below and in a separate topic review.  'High-risk procedures (eg, aerosol-generating procedures)' below and 'Routine care in the ambulatory or hospital setting' below and  \"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection\", section on 'Type of PPE'.)\n【23】 Respirators with exhalation valves or vents should not be used in the health care setting since they do not provide source control. However, if needed in the setting of PPE shortages, a medical mask must be placed on top of the respirator.\n【24】 Masks should be changed if they become soiled, damp, or difficult to breathe through. If they are used during the care of a patient for whom a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved respirator or facemask is indicated for PPE (eg, during a surgical procedure, or during care of a patient on droplet precautions), they should be removed after the patient care encounter and a new one should be donned prior to the next encounter . Depending upon hospital policy, respirators should be discarded or removed and stored for later use. Considerations for extended use/reuse of PPE when caring for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who are on the same unit are discussed elsewhere.   \"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection\", section on 'Extended or limited reuse of PPE'.)\n【25】 The benefit of universal masking of HCP has been demonstrated in several studies. In one report, 238 patients were exposed to a HCP with COVID-19, and the only clear case of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurred when neither the provider nor the patient was wearing a mask . In another study of 703 unvaccinated HCP, 50 were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing; risk factors for infection included being in the break room without a medical mask for more than 15 minutes, consuming food within one meter of an HCP, and failing to keep a safe social distance from other HCP .\n【26】 In addition, studies have demonstrated a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections in HCP . In one report that evaluated nearly 10,000 HCP in Massachusetts who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 (mainly because of symptoms), the proportion with positive test results steadily declined after the introduction of universal masking (from 14.7 to 11.5 percent over 29 days) despite an increase in the number of cases in the community . Similarly, in a study from North Carolina, the cumulative incidence rate of health care-acquired COVID-19 stabilized after the introduction of universal masking despite an increased incidence of COVID-19 in the community .\n【27】 PRECAUTIONS FOR THOSE NOT SUSPECTED OF HAVING COVID-19 — When there is ongoing community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), enhanced infection prevention precautions should be used when caring for patients who are not suspected of having COVID-19, even those who are vaccinated and/or had a negative test for SARS-CoV-2 upon entry into the health care setting . The types of precautions depend on the degree of community transmission and whether the health care worker is providing routine care or is involved with high-risk procedures (eg, aerosol-generating procedures or treatments).  'Routine care in the ambulatory or hospital setting' below and 'High-risk procedures (eg, aerosol-generating procedures)' below.)\n【28】 Routine care in the ambulatory or hospital setting — We suggest the following precautions for HCP providing routine care in the ambulatory or hospital setting (ie, not during aerosol-generating procedures or treatments) in areas of substantial to high community transmission:\n【29】 A medical mask (eg, surgical mask) or respirator without an exhalation valve should be used at all times; this provides protection for the HCP and is also used for source control. When supplies allow, the use of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 (or equivalent) or higher-level respirators is preferred, particularly if there are multiple risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (eg, if the patient has not received all of their recommended vaccines, is unable to use source control, and/or the area is poorly ventilated).\n【30】 Available data have not demonstrated that respirators reduce occupational acquisition of SARS-CoV-2 compared with medical masks when providing routine care for patients without suspected COVID-19. However, respirators are often preferred when caring for patients in areas with substantial to high community transmission since there is increasing evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via aerosols as well as droplets, and limited data suggest respirators may provide additional protection when caring for those with COVID-19 .  'Overview of transmission' above.)\n【31】 Face or eye protection (goggles or face shields) should be worn in addition to a mask or respirator, particularly when caring for patients who are unable to reliably use a mask and when performing aerosol-generating procedures. HCP who use a full-face shield should be reminded that face shields alone do not provide adequate respiratory protection or source control (ie, they should still wear a medical mask under the face shield).\n【32】 Gloves and gowns should be worn in addition to masks and face or eye protection when evaluating patients with an undiagnosed respiratory infection or when contact precautions are warranted.\n【33】 High-risk procedures (eg, aerosol-generating procedures) — During the COVID-19 pandemic, a respirator, rather than a medical mask, should be used for all aerosol-generating procedures or treatments and surgical procedures that generate potentially infectious aerosols or involve anatomic regions where viral loads might be higher (eg, the nose, throat, oropharynx, and respiratory tract). If the respirator has an exhalation valve or vent, a medical mask should be placed on top of it since these types of respirators are not sufficient for source control.  'Universal use of masks' above.)\n【34】 Bronchoscopy (including mini bronchoalveolar lavage)\n【35】 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation\n【36】 Chest physiotherapy\n【37】 Filter changes on the ventilator\n【38】 High-flow oxygen\n【39】 Manual ventilation before intubation\n【40】 Nasal endoscopy\n【41】 Nebulizer treatments\n【42】 Noninvasive ventilation\n【43】 Open suctioning of airways\n【44】 Swallowing evaluation\n【45】 Tracheal intubation and extubation\n【46】 Tracheotomy\n【47】 Upper endoscopy (including transesophageal echocardiogram)\n【48】 PATIENTS WHO HAVE HAD AN EXPOSURE TO COVID-19 — Some patients who require hospitalization for a reason unrelated to COVID-19 may have had close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the last 10 days. The includes exposure during the 48 hours prior to that source patient developing symptoms.\n【49】 Symptomatic patients — All patients with symptoms of COVID-19 should be treated as if they have COVID-19, pending additional evaluation.   \"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection\".)\n【50】 Asymptomatic patients\n【51】 Patients without recent COVID-19\n【52】 Masking around others – In the hospital setting, asymptomatic patients who have had close contact with someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should wear a mask around others until at least 10 days have passed or they have three negative tests 48 hours apart, using the same approach as that used for determining the duration of quarantine, described below. However, in many health care settings, universal masking around others is required for all patients, regardless of exposure.  'Universal use of masks' above.)\n【53】 Who requires quarantine – In addition to masking, some patients may require transmission-based precautions . This includes:\n【54】 When caring for patients who are being quarantined, clinicians should use infection prevention precautions similar to those used for patients with suspected disease. However, such patients should not be cohorted or share a room with patients who have COVID-19.   \"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection\", section on 'General approach'.)\n【55】 Duration of quarantine – The duration of quarantine depends upon the availability of testing. If viral testing is not able to be performed, asymptomatic patients can be removed from transmission-based precautions 10 days following the exposure (the day of exposure is day 0).\n【56】 However, asymptomatic patients may be able to discontinue transmission-based precautions seven days following the exposure if testing is available . Patients should have a series of three viral tests (preferably RT-PCR tests):\n【57】 Although the results of testing may be back on day 5, we continue quarantine through day 7 to ensure no symptoms have developed.\n【58】 Patients with COVID-19 in the last 90 days — In general, most asymptomatic patients who had confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within the last 90 days (particularly if infection occurred in the last 30 days) do not need to quarantine after an exposure to COVID-19 since such patients are unlikely to develop recurrent infection in that time frame.\n【59】 PRECAUTIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH SUSPECTED OR CONFIRMED COVID-19 — In the health care setting, isolation precautions for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be implemented until at least 10 days have passed since the onset of symptoms or first positive test. The duration of isolation may need to be extended for immunocompromised patients and those who had severe disease. This approach differs from that in the community.   \"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection\", section on 'Discontinuation of precautions'.)\n【60】 ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANING AND DISINFECTION — To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, environmental infection prevention procedures should be implemented . In United States health care settings, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states routine cleaning and disinfection procedures are appropriate for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) . Products approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for emerging viral pathogens should be used; a list of EPA-registered products can be found here. Specific guidance on environmental measures, including those used in the home setting, is available on the CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) websites and is discussed in greater detail elsewhere.   \"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection\", section on 'Environmental disinfection' and  \"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection\", section on 'Infection prevention in the home setting'.)\n【61】 WHEN PPE IS LIMITED — When availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) is limited, strategies to preserve the supply include canceling nonurgent procedures or visits that would warrant use of PPE and prioritizing the use of certain PPE for the highest-risk situations. Cautious extended or limited reuse of PPE can also be considered in select situations.   \"COVID-19: Infection prevention for persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection\", section on 'When PPE is limited'.)\n【62】 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS\n【63】 Management of HCP — Health care personnel (HCP) are at risk for developing COVID-19 through exposures in the community and in the health care setting. To reduce transmission of infection to patients and coworkers, certain work restrictions testing should be implemented after an exposure. The approach depends upon whether the HCP has had SARS-CoV-2 infection within the last 30 to 90 days; if the HCP is immunocompromised; the duration and proximity of exposure; the type of personal protective equipment (PPE) used by the provider; whether the source patient wore a mask; and whether an aerosol-generating or high-risk procedure was performed. The management of HCP after an exposure is discussed in detail elsewhere.   \"COVID-19: Occupational health issues for health care personnel\", section on 'HCP exposed to SARS-CoV-2'.)\n【64】 Role of serologic testing — Serologic tests may be able to identify patients who have a prolonged illness (eg, greater than 14 days) and a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, as well as those who had previous infection. However, these tests are not useful for assessing the presence of infection in an exposed patient or HCP and, until their sensitivity and specificity are further assessed, they should not be used for determining the use of infection prevention precautions. Additional information on serologic testing is presented elsewhere.   \"COVID-19: Diagnosis\", section on 'Serology to identify prior/late infection'.)\n【65】 Addressing barriers to PPE — Despite the benefits of personal protective equipment (PPE) in reducing transmission of COVID-19, adherence to practices, such as prolonged use of masks, respirators, and face shields, can be difficult since PPE can be burdensome and uncomfortable to use . To help address potential barriers, certain strategies can be employed. As an example, people who wear glasses often complain of fogging of their eyewear when wearing a mask or face shield. To minimize this problem, individuals who wear eye glasses should receive instruction on how to reduce or prevent fogging by adjusting the mask fit and/or washing their eyeglasses with soapy water . In addition, to address PPE-induced skin injury, the American Academy of Dermatology has released recommendations on preventing and treating occupationally induced dermatologic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional information on preventing skin injuries related to PPE is presented elsewhere.   \"COVID-19: Cutaneous manifestations and issues related to dermatologic care\", section on 'Personal protective equipment-induced skin injury'.)\n【66】 SPECIAL SETTINGS\n【67】 Long-term care facilities — Similar to other health care settings, certain measures should be used for all patients, visitors, and health care personnel (HCP) entering long-term care facilities. In some cases, a patient may be entering a facility after being hospitalized for COVID-19. Infection control precautions for COVID-19 are still required if the patient is discharged from the hospital before criteria for discontinuing precautions are met. More detailed information on infection prevention in long-term care facilities can be found on the CDC website and in a separate topic review.   \"COVID-19: Management in nursing homes\".)\n【68】 Dialysis — Similar to other health care settings, dialysis centers should identify patients with signs and symptoms of respiratory infection (eg, fever, cough) before they enter the treatment area. If a patient has suspected infection when they arrive, they should be placed in a private room with the door shut, and testing should be arranged. If that is not possible, they should be cohorted to a specific well-ventilated unit, wear a mask, and be separated by at least six feet (two meters) from the nearest patient. A detailed discussion of infection control precautions in dialysis centers is presented in a separate topic review.   \"COVID-19: Issues related to end-stage kidney disease\", section on 'Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis'.)\n【69】 Anesthesia care — Goals for infection prevention during anesthesia include prevention of transmission of infection to care providers and prevention of contamination of the anesthesia machine and other anesthesia equipment. This is discussed in detail elsewhere.   \"Overview of infection control during anesthetic care\", section on 'Considerations during aerosol-generating procedures'.)\n【70】  — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.   \": COVID-19 – Index of guideline topics\".)\n【71】 Overview of interventions – Several interventions should be used to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the health care setting. These include universal source control (eg, covering the nose and mouth to contain respiratory secretions), COVID-19 vaccination, early identification and isolation of patients with suspected disease, and use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when caring for patients with and without COVID-19.  'Introduction' above.)\n【72】 Screening – Patients should be screened for symptoms of COVID-19 before entry into the health care facility to reduce unnecessary exposures to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Many patients can be managed from home through telemedicine and will not need to enter a health care facility.  'Screening prior to and upon entry into the health care facility' above.)\n【73】 Patients, visitors, and health care personnel (HCP) who enter the health care facility should also be screened for clinical manifestations consistent with COVID-19. This is often done through signs and posters informing patients about the symptoms of COVID-19.  'Screening prior to and upon entry into the health care facility' above and 'Patients who have had an exposure to COVID-19' above.)\n【74】 Universal masking – For patients, visitors, and HCP in the health care setting the use of universal masking varies depending upon hospital policy, and depends in part on local epidemiology and community transmission rates. Symptom screening alone is insufficient to identify individuals with COVID-19 since presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission can occur. However, masking policies depends on the specific institution, and some only implement universal masking when community transmission levels are high.  'Universal use of masks' above.)\n【75】 Infection control precautions – Infection prevention policies and precautions are the same for all HCP, even those who have received their recommended COVID-19 vaccines\n【76】 Environmental cleaning – To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, environmental infection prevention procedures should be implemented. In United States health care settings, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that routine cleaning and disinfection procedures are appropriate for SARS-CoV-2.  'Environmental cleaning and disinfection' above.)\n【77】 Specific health care settings – In select health care settings (eg, long-term health care facilities, dialysis, operating room), there may be additional considerations for infection prevention policies and precautions. These are discussed in separate topic reviews.   \"COVID-19: Occupational health issues for health care personnel\" and  \"COVID-19: Management in nursing homes\" and  \"COVID-19: Issues related to end-stage kidney disease\" and  \"Overview of infection control during anesthetic care\", section on 'Infectious agents transmitted by aerosol (eg, COVID-19)'.)\n", "title": "COVID-19：医疗场所感染预防的一般方法", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/covid-19-general-approach-to-infection-prevention-in-the-health-care-setting?search=COVID-19%E4%B8%AA%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%B2&source=search_result&selectedTitle=4%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:48:08"}

The epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, diagnosis and staging of gastric cancer are discussed elsewhere.   \"Epidemiology of gastric cancer\" and  \"Risk factors for gastric cancer\" and  \"Clinical features, diagnosis, and staging of gastric cancer\".)\n【2】 The distribution of gastric cancer is markedly varied worldwide, with the areas presenting the highest rates of incidence (>60 per 100,000 males) found in Eastern Asia (Korea), Eastern Europe, and Central and Latin America. Conversely, some geographic zones have low incidence rates (<15 per 100,000 population), such as North America, Northern Europe, and Africa . Morphologic differences also align with this epidemiologic diversity. The intestinal type of adenocarcinoma is predominant in high-risk areas, while the diffuse type is relatively more common in low-risk areas. Also, distal cancers of the antrum and pylorus tend to be most common in high-risk countries, while cancers of the cardia are most common in Western nations of low incidence .   \"Epidemiology of gastric cancer\", section on 'Regional variation'.)\n【3】 Gastric carcinoma is extremely rare in persons under the age of 30 years . In younger individuals, poorly cohesive diffuse-type tumors are predominant .   \"Epidemiology of gastric cancer\", section on 'Incidence'.)\n【4】 Nevertheless, only a small minority of individuals infected with H. pylori develops gastric cancer, and it is thought that modulation of the effects of chronic infection by genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and H. pylori bacterial strain differences all influence the evolution into a neoplastic or nonneoplastic process . H. pylori virulence factors that vary between strains, namely the cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) and vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA), appear to influence the pathogenicity of the bacteria and the risk of gastric precancerous lesions and adenocarcinoma . The variation in virulence factors relates to higher degrees of mucosal inflammation and progression of precancerous lesions .   \"Pathophysiology of and immune response to Helicobacter pylori infection\", section on 'Bacterial strain differences'.)\n【5】 Aspects of host genetic susceptibility that affect the inflammatory response also impact the gastric cancer risk associated with H. pylori infection. As an example, polymorphisms in genes encoding interleukin 1 (IL-1) beta, the IL-1 receptor antagonist, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha, and IL-10 have been implicated in the initiation and modulation of the inflammatory response and have been associated with susceptibility to carcinogenesis .   \"Pathophysiology of and immune response to Helicobacter pylori infection\", section on 'Inflammatory response'.)\n【6】 Gland-forming adenocarcinomas (ie, those of the tubular, papillary, mucinous, and mixed types) are causally related to H. pylori. The poorly cohesive histologic type (corresponding to Lauren's classification of \"diffuse gastric cancer\") is more likely to result from hereditary characteristics modulated by environmental influences, while H. pylori is probably limited to a subset of sporadic cases in this subgroup .  'Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer' below.)\n【7】 In contrast to non-cardia gastric cancers, there appears to be a strong inverse relationship of H. pylori with cancers of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and cardia, and their precursor lesion, Barrett's esophagus .\n【8】 Endoscopic surveillance strategies for those with gastric intestinal metaplasia, atrophic gastritis, and dysplasia are discussed in detail elsewhere.   \"Gastric intestinal metaplasia\", section on 'Management' and  \"Metaplastic (chronic) atrophic gastritis\", section on 'Endoscopic surveillance in selected patients'.)\n【9】 It is important to emphasize that nonatrophic antral gastritis, which is the predominant finding in patients with an H. pylori-associated duodenal peptic ulcer, is not related to an increased cancer risk.   \"Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and duodenal ulcer\".)\n【10】 In a subset of patients, atrophy with intestinal metaplasia will develop, beginning a sequence of events that may culminate in adenocarcinoma; the rate of progression to atrophic gastritis/intestinal neoplasia in large cohorts is 0.1 to 0.9 percent . The prevalence of intestinal metaplasia in the community among H. pylori-affected patients varies significantly from region to region, with a possible correlation between intestinal metaplasia prevalence and the availability of tobacco .\n【11】 Several classifications of chronic gastritis have been developed in an attempt to combine topographic, morphologic, and etiologic information into a reporting system including both grading and staging of gastritis, while other systems, like the Operative Link for Gastritis Assessment (OLGA), rank the histologic phenotypes of gastritis along a scale of increasing mucosal atrophy, with high-stage disease being associated with a high risk of gastric cancer . There is no one universally accepted classification system that is prognostically useful. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere.   \"Gastritis: Etiology and diagnosis\", section on 'Etiology and classification'.)\n【12】 In addition to the pattern and type of mucin expression, currently used classifications for gastric intestinal metaplasia also take into consideration the presence of Paneth cells (complete metaplasia) or crescent architecture changes, dedifferentiation, and the degree of absence of Paneth cells (incomplete metaplasia). Complete-type intestinal metaplasia displays goblet cells and absorptive cells with a brush border and shows decreased/absent expression of gastric mucins (MUC5AC and MUC6) and expression of MUC2 (an intestinal mucin) . Incomplete intestinal metaplasia displays goblet and columnar nonabsorptive cells without a brush border and coexpression of gastric mucins and MUC2.\n【13】 Morphologically, the first metaplastic glands seen in chronic H. pylori infection phenotypically resemble those of the small intestine, with eosinophilic absorptive enterocytes with a brush border alternating with mucus-producing goblet cells (ie, type I, complete, or small intestinal-type metaplasia . These changes are thought to be triggered by the loss of the acid-secreting parietal cells.\n【14】 More advanced stages adopt characteristic changes that are more similar to colonic phenotype, with the glands becoming lined by irregular goblet cells (type III, incomplete types IIA/II, and IIB/III incomplete colonic metaplasia  . More advanced stages of metaplasia increase the risk of gastric cancer . As an example, a systematic review of 10 observational studies showed that the risk of gastric cancer was 4- to 11-fold higher among those with incomplete metaplasia, compared with either complete metaplasia or the absence of incomplete type metaplasia .\n【15】 Incomplete metaplasia is frequently detected around early gastric adenocarcinomas. Some consider colonic metaplasia to represent an early stage of dysplasia, deserving closer endoscopic surveillance than type I (small intestinal) metaplasia . The metaplastic changes are first , especially in the area of the incisura angularis. Over time, the foci of metaplasia become larger and more numerous, extending to the antrum as well as to the corpus of the gastric mucosa. The larger the atrophic and metaplastic area, the greater the cancer risk.\n【16】 Corpus-predominant gastritis with multifocal gastric atrophy with intestinal metaplasia and hypo- or achlorhydria develops in approximately 1 percent of subjects infected with H. pylori. As a consequence of the elevation in gastric pH, a change in the gastric flora is observed, with colonization by anaerobic bacteria responsible for the formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines . Hypochlorhydria and low levels of pepsinogen I (produced by the chief cells of the corpus) and gastrin  (produced by antral G cells) can be measured in the serum and can be used as an indicator of gastric atrophy and cancer risk .\n【17】 Multiple studies have indicated a positive correlation between the degree of incomplete intestinal metaplasia, the extent of intestinal metaplasia overall, and the risk of gastric carcinoma . However, not all studies have been positive , and there is little genetic mutational evidence to implicate intestinal metaplasia as a true direct precursor of gastric cancer.\n【18】 Another pattern of metaplasia is described, termed \"spasmolytic polypeptide-expressing metaplasia\" (SPEM), which strongly expresses trefoil factor family 2 (TFF2, previously designated spasmolytic polypeptide) and is associated with atrophy of the oxyntic mucosa. SPEM has also been termed \"pseudopyloric metaplasia,\" and it has a strong association with both chronic infection with H. pylori and gastric adenocarcinoma . While SPEM may represent another separate pathway to gastric neoplasia, the two processes may be linked. Mouse models have shown that SPEM can develop following oxyntic atrophy through transdifferentiation of zymogen-secreting chief cells into cells that have a mucous secretory profile . Increasing evidence suggests that this process of chief cell reprogramming requires the influence of inflammatory cytokines in addition to oxyntic atrophy , and that SPEM may represent a physiologic repair mechanism for recruiting reparative progenitor cells in response to mucosal wounds . More recent research has shown that the presence of SPEM allows H. pylori to access deeper regions along the gastric corpus unit, which may allow it to spread throughout the stomach . Evolution of intestinal metaplasia from SPEM may lead to a hyperproliferative state in which the infected and inflamed mucosa may be more susceptible to establishment of deleterious mutations in stem or progenitor cell populations .\n【19】 The prevalence of gastric dysplasia mirrors that of gastric adenocarcinoma, with regional variation . The mean age of patients is approximately a decade younger than that of those with gastric cancer, with a mean age of 61.35 versus 70 years . Male predominance is  .\n【20】 Although rare, dysplasia can also develop in nonadenomatous gastric polyps, even in the absence of H. pylori infection:\n【21】 The nomenclature of advanced premalignant lesions in Japan has differed considerably from that of Western countries. In the West, invasive gastric cancer is typically defined by stromal invasion, while in Japan, severe nuclear and architectural abnormalities, even if confined to glandular structures, are considered sufficient to classify a lesion as \"strongly suspicious for invasive carcinoma.\" Furthermore, Japanese pathologists use the term \"borderline\" to describe lesions that, in Western countries, would be labeled low-grade dysplasia . The Padova classification attempted to reconcile the two systems by assigning numerical categories based on the descriptive findings  .\n【22】 These discrepancies are more semantic than substantial. In Western countries, close endoscopic monitoring is considered appropriate for patients with low-grade gastric dysplasia, with intervention only if the lesions progress. On the other hand, the majority of clinicians (although not all) recommend surgical or endoscopic resection for patients with high-grade dysplasia . This is because areas of microinvasion can be found in some patients undergoing resection for high-grade dysplasia, although the proportion is not well established. In Japan, most \"adenomas\" and \"early carcinomas\" do not undergo surveillance but are treated with endoscopic resection, a technique that is used much less in the West.   \"Early gastric cancer: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging\".)\n【23】 Type II dysplasia (gastric phenotype) is a second morphologic type of gastric dysplasia, composed of foveolar- or pyloric-type epithelium. Microscopically, the lesions are composed of low cuboidal cells with round to oval, nonstratified nuclei with a pale to clear cytoplasm (due to the presence of apical mucin caps, a feature of foveolar differentiation) or oncocytic to ground-glass cytoplasm (a feature of pyloric differentiation)  gastric cancer, this is not universal, although a more aggressive biology of this subtype is suggested by others .\n【24】 Some patients have dysplasia-like atypia that is limited to the pit epithelium but without involvement of the surface epithelium. The nature and significance of basal gland atypia/pit dysplasia, usually reported at the periphery of bona fide gastric dysplasia and as \"indefinite for dysplasia\" on a pathology report, remain to be confirmed. This lesion is characterized by an increased nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio, nuclear size and irregularity, hyperchromasia, and increased mitoses at the base of the pits with a normal mucosal surface . Most authors have concluded that this represents an important neoplastic precursor lesion in gastric carcinogenesis.\n【25】 In the context of an adenomatous gastric polyp, the probability of finding foci of invasive adenocarcinoma increases with an increase in the size of adenoma, and the risk is as high as 50 percent for polyps >2 cm. Furthermore, a synchronous adenocarcinoma in another area of the stomach has been found in up to 30 percent of patients detected with an adenomatous gastric polyp .\n【26】 A possible role in gastric cancer was initially suggested in a study from Korea in which evidence of EBV was found in the tumor cells of 12 of 89 (13 percent) gastric carcinoma patients compared with none of 27 controls with a benign ulcer or any of the benign tissues from the cases . Some of the tumor cells had a histologic appearance similar to that of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Since then, it has been estimated that between 5 and 10 percent of gastric cancers worldwide are associated with EBV , although a role for EBV in gastric carcinogenesis, either directly or as a secondary effect, is debated .\n【27】 EBV-associated gastric cancers (EBVaGCs) have distinct clinicopathologic characteristics, including male predominance, preferential location in the gastric cardia or postsurgical gastric stump, lymphocytic infiltration, a lower frequency of lymph node metastasis, perhaps a more favorable prognosis, and a diffuse type of histology in most , but not all , series.  'Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer' below.)\n【28】 In addition, in part due to the overexpression/amplification of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in EBVaGCs, these tumors are good candidates for therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors.  'Epstein-Barr virus-associated gastric cancer' below and 'PD-L1 overexpression and deficient mismatch repair' below.)\n【29】 However, while familial aggregation of gastric cancer occurs in around 10 to 20 percent of patients with gastric cancer, fewer than 5 percent of cases result from an inherited predisposition to cancer . One of these syndromes, hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), is an autosomal dominant cancer susceptibility syndrome characterized by signet ring cell (diffuse) gastric cancer and lobular breast cancer; it is caused by a germline defect in the CDH1 (E-cadherin 1) gene.  'Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer' below.)\n【30】 Two other types of familial predisposition to gastric cancer are described: familial intestinal gastric cancer (FIGC) and gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (GAPPS). The risk of developing gastric cancer is high in these families, but only HDGC is genetically explained. A  of clinical features, recommendations for genetic screening, and the genetic alterations described for these three syndromes is outlined in the table\n【31】 Affected individuals also have an increased risk for lobular breast cancer (cumulative risk by age 80 is approximately 42 percent).   \"Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer\", section on 'Breast cancer'.)\n【32】 Many families with HDGC have germline pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in the CDH1 gene that are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Germline CDH1 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants have been identified in approximately 15 to 50 percent of affected kindreds that meet the clinical criteria for HDGC, as defined by the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) . According to the two-hit hypothesis, a second-hit somatic event (commonly promoter hypermethylation) leading to biallelic inactivation is necessary for the development of gastric cancer in mutation carriers.\n【33】 Unlike the somatic mutations in CDH1 that occur in sporadic gastric cancers and cluster around exons 7 and 8, the germline mutations in CDH1 in HDGC families span the whole length of the gene, and no hot spots have been identified. Other potential candidate pathogenic variants have been identified in those who meet clinical criteria for HDGC but lack germline mutations in CDH1, including those in CTNNA1 (the gene for alpha-catenin), BRCA2 (the gene associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome), STK11 (the gene associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome), SDHB, PRSS1, ATM, MSR1, and PALB2.   \"Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer\", section on 'Molecular genetics'.)\n【34】 The stomach cancers display the common macroscopic features observed in the sporadic setting of gastric cancer of the intestinal (gland-forming) type  'Intestinal versus diffuse types' below). Few recommendations are available for management of patients with suspected FIGC .\n【35】 World Health Organization (WHO) poorly cohesive (Lauren diffuse-type) cancers have a greater tendency to invade the gastric wall, sometimes extending to the lower esophagus or to the duodenum via submucosal or subserosal routes or via the submucosal lymphatics. Occasionally, a wide region of the gastric wall or even the entire stomach is extensively infiltrated, resulting in a rigid, thickened stomach, termed \"linitis plastica\" (image 1 and image 2). Bilateral massive ovarian involvement (Krukenberg tumor) can result from transperitoneal or hematogenous spread.\n【36】 Lymphatic and vascular invasion carries a poor prognosis in gastric cancer. The incidence of lymph node metastatic disease increases with the depth of tumor invasion  and occurs with equal frequency regardless of histologic type. The distribution varies according to the location of the tumor\n【37】 The accuracy of pathologic staging is proportional to the number of regional lymph nodes examined and their anatomic location in relation to the neoplasm. A discussion on the appropriate extent of lymph node dissection and the prognostic influence of primary tumor (T) and nodal (N) stage are discussed in more detail elsewhere.   \"Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer\", section on 'Extent of lymph node dissection' and  \"Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer\", section on 'Prognosis'.)\n【38】 Importantly, this definition, which has been adopted by the Japanese National Cancer Centre, the Japan Gastric Cancer Association, and other international groups, acknowledges that there is a small percentage of patients with EGC who have lymph node involvement . These cancers should still be considered EGC, even if they have nodal metastases, as is supported by decades of investigation and data from screening programs .\n【39】 However, nodal metastases can affect treatment of EGC in two ways   \"Early gastric cancer: Treatment, natural history, and prognosis\"):\n【40】 Countries with a high incidence of gastric cancer and in which asymptomatic patients are screened for gastric cancer have a high incidence of EGCs, ranging from 30 to 50 percent, with lower figures for Western populations (15 to 21 percent).   \"Gastric cancer screening\" and  \"Early gastric cancer: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging\", section on 'Epidemiology'.)\n【41】 EGCs are endoscopically divided into three types based on their appearance (the Paris system of classification\n【42】 Histologically, small (<2 cm) and minute (<5 mm) EGCs are commonly well differentiated. As tumor size increases and submucosal invasion develops, histologic diversity with mixed or poorly differentiated components is more common.\n【43】 EGCs are characterized by a low incidence of vessel invasion and lymph node metastasis, and a good prognosis (approximately 90 percent at 10 years). Endoscopic resection is an effective therapeutic choice for EGCs without clinical suspicion of lymph node metastasis that meets the following criteria:\n【44】 Gastrectomy is appropriate for patients with EGC who have lymph node involvement that is detected or highly suspected during the preoperative staging evaluation and for others who do not meet the standard criteria for endoscopic resection. Standard and expanded criteria for endoscopic resection of EGC are presented in detail elsewhere.   \"Early gastric cancer: Treatment, natural history, and prognosis\", section on 'Standard and expanded criteria for endoscopic resection'.)\n【45】 Ulcerated tumors differ from benign ulcers by having an irregular margin with raised borders and thickened, uneven, and indurated surrounding mucosa. The ulcer base is necrotic, shaggy, and often nodular. Mucosal folds radiating from the crater are irregular and frequently show club-like thickening and fusion . Invasive adenocarcinoma, particularly when composed of poorly cohesive neoplastic cells, may spread superficially in the mucosa and submucosa, giving rise to plaque-like lesions with flattening of the rugal folds. In some cases, superficial ulceration supervenes. The infiltration may involve the entire thickness of the wall and produce the so-called linitis plastica appearance (image 1). Some mucinous adenocarcinomas may secrete considerable amounts of mucin, giving the tumor a gelatinous appearance.\n【46】 Nevertheless, since the seminal paper by Lauren in 1965, gastric adenocarcinomas have historically been divided into two distinct histomorphologic subtypes, intestinal (ie, gland-forming) and diffuse (composed of discohesive cells), which have a distinct morphologic appearance, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and genetic profile . Broadly, the morphologic differences are attributable to different genetic and epigenetic alterations, some related to intercellular adhesion molecules, which are preserved in intestinal-type tumors and defective in diffuse carcinomas:\n【47】 A molecular basis for this difference is now apparent. The main carcinogenic event in diffuse carcinomas is loss of expression of E-cadherin, a key cell surface protein for establishing intercellular connections and maintaining the organization of epithelial tissues . Loss of expression of E-cadherin leads to defective intercellular adhesions. Biallelic inactivation of the gene encoding E-cadherin (CDH1) can occur through germline or somatic mutation, allelic imbalance events (eg, loss of heterozygosity), or epigenetic silencing of gene transcription through aberrant methylation of the CDH1 promoter. Individuals who inherit germline CDH1 mutations are considered to have hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), and they are predisposed both to EGC\n【48】 In direct contrast, the molecular basis underlying intestinal-type gastric cancers is less well defined. However, it appears to follow a multistep progression that is usually initiated by H. pylori infection. Like intestinal-type cancers, diffuse-type gastric carcinomas also can be induced by H. pylori infection. However, in contrast with intestinal-type cancers, a defined series of preneoplastic stages is not well defined.  'Helicobacter pylori' above.)\n【49】 Early stage HDGC in CDH1 mutation carriers is characterized by multiple foci of invasive (T1a) signet ring cell (diffuse, poorly cohesive) carcinoma in the superficial gastric mucosa without nodal metastases . Precursor lesions (Tis) can be recognized: pagetoid spread of signet ring cells below the preserved epithelium of glands and foveolae but within the basal membrane, or in situ signet ring cell carcinoma, corresponding to the presence of signet ring cells within the basal membrane, substituting the normal epithelial cells . In these lesions, E-cadherin immunoexpression is reduced or absent . Because the EGCs that develop in these individuals are multifocal and located beneath an intact mucosal surface , early detection is difficult. Given this fact, and the poor prognosis of these tumors when locoregionally advanced, patients with evidence of a CDH1 germline mutation in the context of a family history of HDGC are candidates for prophylactic gastrectomy.   \"Surgical management of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer\", section on 'Indications for prophylactic total gastrectomy'.)\n【50】 Abnormalities in CDH1 have also been linked to sporadic diffuse (and intestinal) carcinomas. Somatic mutations in the CDH1 gene are identified in 40 to 83 percent of sporadic diffuse-type gastric cancers . One analysis of 174 sporadic gastric cancers found that CDH1 alterations (both structural alterations, such as mutations or loss of heterozygosity, and epigenetic alterations) were present in 34 percent of diffuse-type gastric cancers and in 26 percent of intestinal cancers . This analysis found no structural alterations among 19 patients with HDGC, but 53 percent harbored an epigenetic methylation.\n【51】 EBVaGCs display certain distinctive macroscopic and histologic characteristics . Gastric carcinoma with lymphoid stroma is the main variant, and it occurs predominantly in the proximal stomach  and in the gastric stump of patients with a previous partial gastrectomy . The patients are younger than in conventional carcinoma, and males are affected more often . The tumors usually have a well-demarcated pushing, rather than infiltrating, margin. They are typically composed of irregular sheets; trabeculae; ill-defined tubules of polygonal cells admixed with a prominent lymphocytic infiltrate composed of CD8-positive cytotoxic T lymphocytes and, to a lesser degree, B lymphocytes; plasma cells; neutrophils; and eosinophils. Notably, most, but not all, gastric cancers with lymphoid stroma appear to be EBV related  .\n【52】 Two other variants of EBVaGCs are observed: tubular carcinomas with limited desmoplasia, a smaller number of lymphocytes, and prominent lymphoid follicles with active germinal centers (designated as \"carcinoma with Crohn disease-like lymphoid reaction\") and conventional-type adenocarcinomas with scant lymphocytic infiltrate . The prognosis is reportedly better than that for typical gastric cancers .\n【53】 In part due to the overexpression/amplification of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in gastric cancers associated with EBV, these tumors are good candidates for therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors .  'The Cancer Genome Atlas' below and 'PD-L1 overexpression and deficient mismatch repair' below and  \"Initial systemic therapy for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer\", section on 'Immunotherapy-based regimens' and  \"Progressive, locally advanced unresectable, and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer: Approach to later lines of systemic therapy\", section on 'Biomarkers and benefit from PD-1 inhibitors'.)\n【54】 Pure squamous cell carcinomas of the stomach  are usually diagnosed at a late stage and have a poor prognosis .\n【55】 The best terminology has been debated, with some supporting the term \"oxyntic gland polyp/adenoma\" as more appropriate for this type of lesion .\n【56】 Various studies have sought to incorporate multiple molecular readouts to delineate the mechanisms of disease biology and discern potentially useful therapeutic molecular targets. As an example, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) performed a comprehensive analysis of multiple \"omic\" (copy number, mutational, DNA methylation, transcriptome, and proteome) readouts with 295 gastric adenocarcinomas profiled on all five platforms . Others, the Asian Cancer Research Group (ACRG), have analyzed 251 gastric cancers through a combination of gene expression profiling, genome-wide copy marker microarrays, and targeted gene sequencing, generating gene expression profiles by comparing their results to a predefined set of gene expression signatures: epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), microsatellite instability, cytokine signaling, cell proliferation, and DNA methylation . Another study led by the Duke-National University of Singapore compared the gene expression patterns among 248 gastric adenocarcinomas using consensus hierarchical clustering with iterative feature selection . Collectively, these studies report a diverse spectrum of mutational frequencies, with dominant subclones centered around a handful of driver mutations that can form the basis for a molecular classification of gastric cancer.\n【57】 The three studies described above emphasize that gastric cancer is not a single entity but a complex and heterogeneous group of diseases with distinct biologic and clinical features. A premise of precision medicine is that the appropriate matching of tumor molecular subtypes with targeted therapeutic agents will offer superior efficacy and less toxicity, thereby improving clinical outcomes. On a practical level, robust molecular gastric cancer subtyping may resolve, to some degree, the heterogeneity of existing classification schemes, whether surgical, endoscopic, or histopathologic, which remain insufficient to guide treatment for individual patients. These novel attempts at classifying gastric adenocarcinomas integrate the genomic and transcriptomic profiles to define integrative clusters characterized by distinct clinical and morphologic characteristics as well as prognostic outcomes. Ultimately these findings are expected to have significant implications for patient stratification and tailored therapeutic approaches.\n【58】 From a prognostic standpoint, the EBV-related subtype is associated with the best prognosis, and the genetically stable subtype is associated with the worst survival  .\n【59】 Overall, the microsatellite unstable subtype has the best prognosis, while the MSS/EMT subtype has the worst .\n【60】 A comparison of the key characteristics of both the ACRG and TCGA molecular classifications is provided in the table  .\n【61】 Currently, there are only three therapeutically relevant, routinely tested molecular biomarkers in gastric carcinoma: overexpression of HER2 (ERBB2), which permits the selection of patients with advanced disease who might benefit from trastuzumab, and overexpression of PD-L1/dMMR, both of which identify patients with advanced disease with the potential to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy.   \"Initial systemic therapy for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer\", section on 'Cytotoxic chemotherapy options' and  \"Progressive, locally advanced unresectable, and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer: Approach to later lines of systemic therapy\", section on 'Biomarkers and benefit from PD-1 inhibitors'.)\n【62】 HER2 overexpression identifies patients with advanced disease who might benefit from the addition of trastuzumab to a cytotoxic chemotherapy backbone. Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain IV of HER2 and acts against overexpressed HER2 protein on the cell membrane, blocking the downstream effects .   \"Initial systemic therapy for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer\", section on 'HER2-overexpressing adenocarcinomas'.)\n【63】 Accurate determination of HER2 status is important, using a rigorous testing algorithm and robust definitions of gene amplification and protein overexpression to predict those patients who will most benefit from trastuzumab. In comparison with breast carcinomas, the heterogeneity of immunostaining for HER2 protein overexpression is greater in gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas, and the possibility of false-negative testing is higher. Furthermore, HER2 protein expression in gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas tends to spare the digestive luminal membrane, resulting in membrane staining that is not completely circumferential in contrast to breast cancers. These differences underscore the importance of utilizing tumor-specific criteria to assess HER2 expression in clinical practice. Most robust testing algorithms combine IHC and ISH techniques to assess HER2 status. In general, bright-field silver in situ hybridization (SISH) is superior to the dark-field ISH (eg, fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH]) .   \"Initial systemic therapy for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer\", section on 'Assessment of HER2 status and selection of candidates for trastuzumab'.)\n【64】 Concordance of HER2 status between biopsy and resection specimens, as well as primary and metastatic sites, is very high but not perfect . Heterogeneous amplification of HER2 in primary lesions is thought to be responsible for most of the discordant HER2 statuses of primary and metastatic lesions in gastric carcinoma . However, concordance rates as high as 95 to 98 percent have been reported in paired samples .\n【65】 Nevertheless, insufficient tumor representation in endoscopic biopsies may lead to a false-negative result. Analyzing HER2 positivity in <6 biopsy samples leads to a false-negative rate that may be as high as 9 percent . The optimal number of tumor fragments that is required for testing of endoscopic biopsies is at least five .\n【66】 Given the differences in interpretive criteria for determining HER2 status in gastroesophageal as compared with breast cancers , an expert panel convened by the College of American Pathologists (CAP), American Society of Clinical Pathology (ASCP), and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) undertook a systematic review of the published literature to provide an evidence-based joint guideline on HER2 testing and clinical decision making in gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas . Among the panel's recommendations were the following:\n【67】 HER2 testing to identify patients with advanced esophagogastric adenocarcinoma who might be eligible for HER2-targeted therapies is discussed in more detail elsewhere.   \"Initial systemic therapy for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer\", section on 'Assessment of HER2 status and selection of candidates for trastuzumab'.)\n【68】 Treatments are available that target both the PD-1 and PD-L1 molecules, which remove the \"brake\" on immune surveillance, thereby permitting the body's immune system to recognize and destroy the tumor cells, despite their overexpression of PD-L1 and PD-L2. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab, therapeutic antibodies targeting PD-1, provide durable antitumor activity in advanced PD-L1-expressing esophagogastric cancer; responses  in patients with PD-L1-nonexpressing tumors. The issue of using biomarkers such as PD-L1 to predict benefit from PD-1-blocking antibodies is in evolution, and discussed in more detail elsewhere.   \"Initial systemic therapy for locally advanced unresectable and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer\", section on 'Immunotherapy-based regimens' and  \"Progressive, locally advanced unresectable, and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer: Approach to later lines of systemic therapy\", section on 'PD-L1 overexpression'.)\n【69】 Results are more consistent for using defective mismatch repair (dMMR) as a biomarker to indicate potential efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors. It has been hypothesized that across a wide spectrum of tumors, including gastric cancer, those that lack the mismatch repair mechanism (ie, dMMR) harbor many more mutations (ie, they are hypermutated) than do tumors of the same type without such mismatch repair defects, and that the neoantigens generated from mutations such as these have the potential to be recognized as \"non-self\" immunogenic antigens. The biologic footprint of dMMR tumors is high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H). In fact, patients with metastatic gastric cancer whose tumors are MSI-H or dMMR (but not those with proficient mismatch repair [pMMR] tumors) as well as those with a high tumor mutational burden experience clinical benefit from PD-1 inhibitors, and some responses are durable. Pembrolizumab is now approved for treatment of advanced disease in a variety of tumor types, including gastric cancer, with either dMMR or high levels of tumor mutational burden.   \"Tissue-agnostic cancer therapy: DNA mismatch repair deficiency, tumor mutational burden, and response to immune checkpoint blockade in solid tumors\", section on 'Clinical efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy' and  \"Progressive, locally advanced unresectable, and metastatic esophageal and gastric cancer: Approach to later lines of systemic therapy\", section on 'Biomarkers and benefit from PD-1 inhibitors'.)\n", "title": "胃癌的病理学和分子发病机制", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"https://www.uptodate.com//contents/zh-Hans/gastric-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis?search=%E6%9C%AA%E7%89%B9%E6%8C%87%E7%9A%84%E8%83%83%E7%BB%93%E6%9E%84%E5%8F%91%E8%82%B2%E5%BC%82%E5%B8%B8&source=search_result&selectedTitle=1%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 22:27:03"}

With modern techniques, an almost endless array of flaps is available to choose from to provide coverage for even the most complex defects.\n【2】 Flaps are very versatile and can be used to fill large defects, recreate structures such as the breast, or provide better coverage over joints. Flaps, such as the gracilis flap, are available to be transferred as complete muscle units, allowing return of function when connected to recipient nerves. The transferred tissue volume can contain multiple types of tissue, including skin, muscle, nerve, fascia, and bone. The higher volume of tissue transferred demands constant perfusion and will be compromised if the arterial supply or venous drainage is interrupted during or following the transfer of the tissue. Donor site morbidity is often minimal but can be significant depending on the flap chosen.\n【3】 The routine use of flaps has dramatically broadened the ability of the surgeon to care for the injured patient. In addition, previously unresectable cancers have become resectable with the ability to offer flap reconstruction. The ability to move tissues around has improved the quality of life for countless patients. Quality of life and cosmetic outcomes are steadily improving as flaps with lower morbidity are developed, with technical success rates approaching nearly 100 percent.\n【4】 This topic review will discuss the general approach to the use of flaps in reconstructive surgery, including the nomenclature of flaps and preoperative and postoperative considerations, including complications. The use of skin grafts for reconstruction is reviewed separately.   \"Skin autografting\".)\n【5】 FLAP NOMENCLATURE — A flap is a transfer of tissue with its intrinsic blood supply from one part of the body to another. The blood supply to a flap is persistent and does not depend on the recipient bed. Multiple classifications have been described, but, in general, flaps for reconstruction are classified based upon the type of blood supply (ie, random, axial), proximity of the donor tissue to the recipient (ie, local, regional, distant), and tissue composition (eg, musculocutaneous, fasciocutaneous) . Flaps can also be further classified based upon how the donor tissue is transferred into the recipient tissue defect (eg, rotation, advancement).\n【6】 Free skin grafts (split thickness, full thickness) are examples of the transfer of nonvascularized tissue that relies upon a well-vascularized recipient bed to \"take.\" The use and creation of skin grafts is reviewed separately.   \"Skin autografting\".)\n【7】 Blood supply — The blood supply to a flap can be random or derived from a named source (ie, axial).\n【8】 Random flap — Random skin flaps contain only skin and/or subcutaneous tissue and as such, the blood supply to a random flap is provided by the many small unnamed vessels of the subdermal plexus. These flaps are in close proximity to the recipient site.  'Local' below and 'Skin' below.)\n【9】 Axial flap — Axial flaps take advantage of regional areas perfused by named blood vessels (ie, the angiosome). The description of the areas of flow for each vessel were originally determined by cadaver dissection. Most flaps will survive if the tissue transferred contains the vessels responsible for perfusion to that area and, at most, one additional neighboring vascular territory. The angiosome concept has revolutionized flap design, adding anatomic understanding to prior clinical experience . Axial flaps may consist of skin, subcutaneous tissue, muscle, and/or bone; can be pedicled; and can be used regionally or transferred a distance as a free flap.  'Regional' below and 'Distant' below and 'Composition' below.)\n【10】 Pedicled — With a pedicled flap, the vascular supply remains connected anatomically throughout flap transfer. Examples of distant pedicled flaps include the omental flap transferred to the chest and the transverse rectus abdominis muscle (TRAM) flap\n【11】 Free tissue transfer — For free flaps, the artery and at least one vein are disconnected during the transfer and reconnected microsurgically to a new artery and vein at or near the recipient site. The creation of a free flap is complex and requires a substantial level of training, planning, and surgical expertise.\n【12】 Free flaps are most often used in the following situations:\n【13】 Perforator flaps are a special type of free tissue flap that contain a transmuscular and/or transfascial vascular \"leash\" or pedicle that leads to the overlying fascia and/or skin only . The vessels are dissected out of the muscle through which they perforate, and the muscle is left behind, relatively undamaged. Perforator flaps are technically demanding and more time consuming to create than pedicled flaps . These flaps have gained favor as a way to decrease the morbidity associated with musculocutaneous flaps. Free tissue transfer has become commonplace in breast reconstruction using the deep inferior epigastric perforator flap, which is an alternative to the pedicled TRAM flap\n【14】 Proximity of flap donor and recipient sites\n【15】 Local — Local flaps use tissue that abuts the defect that requires coverage. A limitation to the use of local flaps is the availability of healthy, pliable, and well-vascularized donor tissue nearby. The donor site for a local flap ideally should have enough laxity to allow primary closure of the defect, in addition to providing tissue to the recipient site for coverage of the defect. Most local flaps can be performed under local anesthesia with or without sedation. Local flaps have the advantage of \"like to like.\" The skin color, texture, thickness will all closely approximate the recipient site the closer the flap site is to the defect.\n【16】 Regional — Regional flaps are pedicled flaps that use tissue in the vicinity of the defect without actually abutting the defect. These flaps are transferred using a releasing incision along the course of the flap transfer or alternatively are transferred under a skin or tissue tunnel along the course. Any twist of the base of the pedicle or compression of the overlying bridge of tissue can lead to vascular compromise and tissue ischemia more distally in the flap.  'Blood supply' above.)\n【17】 Regional flaps derive their vascular supply from the same anatomic area of the defect to be reconstructed. Regional flaps use skin similar in quality and color to the recipient site, so they are favored in the face, head, and neck when compared with distant flaps or even skin grafts. In the face, using \"like tissue\" is very important for the long-term aesthetic result. Regional flaps are sometimes used in the trunk or extremities.\n【18】 An example of a regional flap is the forehead flap for nasal tip reconstruction, which is based on the supraorbital and supratrochlear vessels and includes the glabellar and frontalis musculature. Another is the radial forearm flap, based on the radial artery, which can be used to cover a defect in the hand.  'Forehead flap' below and 'Radial forearm flap' below.)\n【19】 Many regional flaps are musculocutaneous in nature. Therefore, one must take into account the morbidity of muscle harvest and loss of the donor muscle function.\n【20】 Distant — Distant flaps use tissue far from the defect and can be transferred over a large distance as pedicled flaps or free flaps.  'Blood supply' above.)\n【21】 Numerous distant flaps have been described, including cutaneous, fasciocutaneous, osteocutaneous, musculocutaneous, and even pure muscle flaps. The newer designer flaps, prefabricated and prelaminated flaps, are also included in this category. All of these flaps are transferred with the same principles in mind. First and foremost is that adequate tissue to accomplish the goal is harvested from the recipient site. The donor tissue must be adequately vascularized throughout, and donor site morbidity should be kept to a minimum.\n【22】 The omental flap to the chest is an example of a distant pedicle flap while a free transverse rectus abdominis flap is an example of a microsurgical free distant flap.  'Omental flap' below and 'TRAM flap' below.)\n【23】 Composition — Local, regional, and distant flaps can contain a variety of tissues .\n【24】 Skin — Skin-only flaps are most commonly used as local flaps, though microsurgical transfer of skin-only flaps (eg, scapular and parascapular flaps) has certainly been used.\n【25】 Muscle — The blood supply of a muscle flap is carried through the muscle and may include the overlying tissue . Muscle flaps are well vascularized, and, if skin coverage is inadequate, a split-thickness skin graft can be placed to complete wound closure. Muscle-only flaps are usually used for coverage of large ablative or trauma-induced defects, or for functional purposes.\n【26】 Musculocutaneous — A flap composed of muscle and its overlying skin and subcutaneous tissue is a musculocutaneous flap . The most common regional flaps are musculocutaneous flaps. Musculocutaneous flaps are used for large or deep defects, such as deep perineal defects, or to recreate structures, such as with breast reconstruction (eg, latissimus flap, TRAM flap)  .\n【27】 Fasciocutaneous — A fasciocutaneous flap is composed of skin, subcutaneous tissue, and the underlying fascia.\n【28】 Fasciocutaneous flaps are commonly based on vessels arising in fascial planes in between muscles and do not intrinsically include any muscle in the design. These flaps are less bulky than musculocutaneous flaps and are used to cover large superficial defects when skin alone would not provide adequate coverage. An example of a fasciocutaneous flap is the buttock V-Y flap used for perineal reconstruction . Another commonly used fasciocutaneous flap is an anterolateral thigh flap used to cover a perineogenital skin defect .  'Anterolateral thigh flap' below.)\n【29】 A perforator flap is another type of fasciocutaneous flap that consists of skin and subcutaneous tissue that is vascularized by a perforator artery (eg, musculocutaneous or septocutaneous) . The vessels are dissected out of the tissue through which they perforate, and if the perforator is musculocutaneous, the muscle is left behind . In this way, a large cutaneous flap can be obtained from the same region of a conventional musculocutaneous flap without the need to include the muscle, which might not be expendable. Perforator flaps have gained favor as a way to decrease the morbidity at the donor site . As an example, the use of free tissue transfer has become commonplace in breast reconstruction with the use of perforator flaps, such as the DIEP flap\n【30】 Osteocutaneous — An osteocutaneous flap is a flap containing a bony component. It is used to replace missing bone in the head and neck, or long bones of the extremities. An example of an osteocutaneous flap is a fibular free flap .\n【31】 Designer flaps — Prelaminated and prefabricated \"designer\" flaps are limited to unusual circumstances when more common anatomic flaps are inadequate.\n【32】 PRINCIPLES OF RECONSTRUCTION — A flap is the best approach to wound repair when primary repair is not possible without undue tension or the wound bed is not amenable to grafting because the defect is not well vascularized, such as in those with exposed bone or tendon. Flaps are also the best approach for coverage of large defects or when complex tissue is required to regain normal aesthetics (eg, breast reconstruction) or function (eg, extremity reconstruction).\n【33】 Recipient site evaluation and preparation — Flap selection begins with an analysis of the defect, including the location and condition of the recipient bed, comorbidities (eg, cigarette smoking, history of radiation therapy, diabetes mellitus), cosmetic significance, and functional significance. In addition to evaluating the defect to be closed, the surgeon must consider the donor site morbidity, including scarring and functional loss if the flap includes a muscle.\n【34】 Included in this analysis are the location, size, and functional requirements of the area and exposure of any crucial structures. If the area has been subjected to radiation therapy, the wound is more susceptible to dehiscence and infection.\n【35】 Prior to reconstruction of any wound bed, the surgeon must be sure that the recipient bed is properly prepared. The wound must be free of all necrotic or ischemic tissue. In addition, signs of infection such as local cellulitis, significant edema, or purulent drainage should have abated. However, in contrast to the use of skin grafts, the wound bed need not be well vascularized, since the flap has its own blood supply. Granulation tissue, if present, should be gently debrided back to the wound base to reduce levels of bacterial contamination. Skin margins should be trimmed back to expose healthy, unscarred dermis.\n【36】 Irrigation of the wound bed prior to flap placement should be done to reduce bacterial contamination as much as possible. This is frequently accomplished with 3 to 6 liters of saline solution. Finally, hemostasis after debridement must be meticulous to prevent fluid collections from accumulating beneath the flap tissue.\n【37】 Flap selection and donor site evaluation — Flaps have broad applicability and choice, with an almost endless array of flaps available to cover even the most complex defects. Aesthetic and functional results need to be taken into account, as well as comorbidities and potential donor site morbidity.\n【38】 As a general rule, simple local flaps are used if possible. Regional flaps or distant flaps are used if local options are not available, or if a distant flap will give a better overall functional and cosmetic result.\n【39】 Evaluation of blood supply — Axial flap design requires identification of the appropriate vessel upon which the tissue transfer will be based.\n【40】 In general, the vessel can be identified with a handheld Doppler, and the skin island required is usually centered over the vessel. Advanced imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance angiography and computed tomographic angiography have become more commonplace and delineate the anatomy of flap dissection in advance .\n【41】 Perforator flaps require careful planning to reduce the risk of flap failure using preoperative mapping and localization of perforating arteries using a handheld Doppler . In the operating room, the main perforator is generally identified by making a limited exploratory incision, with additional perforator dissection until the largest and best perforator is identified.\n【42】 Management of donor sites — Defects that are created by harvesting a flap are managed by meticulous hemostasis and a primary closure. Skin grafting is rarely necessary.\n【43】 The donor site is closed in layers to minimize postoperative wound dehiscence, and without tension on the suture line. Drains are used for larger wounds. Self-adhesive strips are applied to the suture line, followed by dry gauze, which is secured with a wrap bandage or adhesive dressing.\n【44】 Physical activity is limited until the wound is healed to avoid rebleeding, hematoma, or dehiscence. Drains are used in donor site beds if the flap harvest disrupts lymphatic drainage, or if there is residual dead space. Drains are left in place until output is ≤30 cc/day.\n【45】 If the donor site cannot be closed primarily, combined use of skin substitute with a split-thickness skin graft provides thicker coverage than a split-thickness skin graft alone without increasing morbidity. As an example, in a retrospective review of 80 patients undergoing a forearm free flap, the cohort treated with a skin substitute and split-thickness skin graft had superior cosmetic results (as judged by patients and surgeon) compared with patients undergoing a split-thickness skin graft alone . Both groups had similar major and minor complication rates (18.8 and 15.0 percent, respectively).   \"Skin autografting\".)\n【46】 Identifying vascular compromise — Vascular compromise is the most common cause of flap failure. Poor flap design and failure to follow the angiosome concept of tissue blood supply can lead to partial flap loss if the flap includes too much tissue and extends beyond the anatomic boundary of the flap's blood supply. Vascular compromise can also occur due to twisting of the vascular pedicle during transfer of the flap to the recipient site. For free flaps, vascular compromise is usually due to thrombosis of either the artery or vein included in the microanastomosis. For total flap necrosis, the flap must be removed. For partial flap loss, the necrotic tissue requires debridement and local wound care.   \"Basic principles of wound management\", section on 'Wound debridement'.)\n【47】 Vascular compromise in pedicled grafts that is identified by color change and diminished capillary refill requires a return to the operating room to check for twisting of the pedicle and re-inset of the flap. In some cases, the flap must be temporarily returned to the donor site to allow for vascular recovery and flap reconstruction delayed.\n【48】 For free flaps, the blood supply is similarly monitored by clinical observation evaluating the color, temperature, capillary refill, bleeding, edema, and appearance of the flap. Vascular compromise of free flaps necessitates prompt return to the operating room for evaluation of the cause and potential revision of the microanastomosis and flap salvage.\n【49】 A simple Doppler unit is often used to evaluate arterial and venous signals in the flap and may improve flap salvage rates . Using a tissue oximeter as an additional form of monitoring has gained favor and also appears to reduce flap loss . In a series of 614 consecutive microsurgical flaps, 380 patients were monitored with clinical inspection and Doppler ultrasound alone, and 234 patients were also monitored with tissue oximetry . Although tissue oximetry did not change the rate of re-exploration, flap loss decreased from 2.9 to 0.4 percent. When available, both Doppler ultrasound and continuous tissue oximetry should be used to monitor free flaps for the first three days after surgery. Monitoring is generally performed every 15 minutes for the first hour, every 30 minutes for the second hour, every hour for the next 10 hours, and then with routine vital signs every four hours.\n【50】 Early recognition and intervention for vascular compromise of tissue flaps using other technologies has been assessed in observational studies using near-infrared spectroscopy to detect vascular compromise , as well as to improve monitoring and communication .\n【51】 COMMONLY USED FLAPS — There are many types of flaps, all of which require specific knowledge of the vascular anatomy of both the recipient and donor site. It is beyond the scope of this topic to review all of the currently available flaps. Commonly performed flaps are presented briefly below.\n【52】 Forehead flap — The forehead flap, which is used for nasal tip reconstruction, is the quintessential regional musculocutaneous flap. This flap is axial in its nature, based on the supraorbital and supratrochlear vessels, and includes some glabellar and frontalis musculature. The flap can be much longer than it is wide due to the axial nature of its blood supply, often reaching up into the hairline of the frontal scalp. Design of the flap is very important, using a template for the exact size of the nasal defect to be covered. This template is then transferred to the upper forehead skin centered over the axial blood supply. The flap is lifted in a submuscular plane, starting superiorly and working down toward the base. The flap can be carefully thinned distally prior to inset. Once elevated, the flap is transposed with a near-180° turn onto the nasal defect and inset with cutaneous sutures. The donor site is then closed in layers. This type of flap will often bridge over normal tissue and requires a secondary or even tertiary inset procedure to separate the base of the flap from the inset portion and to improve the aesthetic contour of the flap. These procedures are usually delayed until the initial edema and erythema have subsided.\n【53】 Omental flap — The greater omentum is a peritoneal fold that drapes over the intestines, consisting of connective tissue, fat, and lymphatics. It gets its blood supply from the gastroepiploic vessels and will survive on either the right- or left-sided vessels . Most commonly, the omental flap is transferred as a pedicle flap, but it can be used as a free tissue transfer (increasingly being used in lymphedema surgery).\n【54】 Chest wall and chest cavity defects are often dealt with by omental flap transfer. Sternotomy wound dehiscence can be corrected with this flap, and empyema cavities can be filled with a large-volume omentum. With use in the chest, the most common complication is an upper abdominal or diaphragmatic hernia as a result of the transfer. This can be managed by transecting the pedicle a few months after transfer once the omentum has reestablished a blood supply and simply repairing the fascia or diaphragm.\n【55】 The lymphatic-rich omental free flap can also be transferred to a lymphedematous upper extremity to improve symptoms.   \"Surgical treatment of primary and secondary lymphedema\".)\n【56】 DIEP flap — The use of free tissue transfer has become commonplace in breast reconstruction, with the deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap most often used .   \"Options for autologous flap-based breast reconstruction\", section on 'Perforator flaps'.)\n【57】 Though technically demanding and more time-consuming than pedicled flaps, perforator flaps have less morbidity at the donor site. The artery and vein are harvested with DIEP flap dissection as they perforate through the rectus muscle. The perforator is dissected free of the muscle, leaving all of the muscle behind, and as such, muscle function is preserved. Long-term studies have confirmed improved abdominal wall function in these patients when compared with pedicled TRAM flaps. Once dissected, the flap is transferred to the chest wall and the flap vessels are anastomosed to the internal mammary or thoracodorsal vessels as the recipients. Most arterial microanastomoses are handsewn with interrupted suture, while an anastomotic coupler is favored for the venous anastomosis .\n【58】 TRAM flap — The transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap can also be used for breast reconstruction\n【59】 The skin island includes the lower abdominal skin from just above the umbilicus to the suprapubic region, and the underlying muscle. With regard to blood supply to the skin, four zones (I to IV) are described. In planning the flap, one must take into account that zone IV and often zone II have poor blood supply, and the use of these areas should be avoided if possible. The anterior sheath is entered just above the pubis, the rectus muscle is transected, and the inferior epigastric artery and vein are ligated. The rectus abdominis muscle is then lifted out of the rectus sheath, with serial ligation of the intercostal neurovascular bundles as they are encountered. In the unilateral procedure, fascial-sparing incisions are possible, so closure of the abdominal wall defect can often be accomplished by primary repair without the need for mesh reinforcement. In the bilateral procedure, mesh repair is always required. Late abdominal bulging is more common in patients repaired with mesh compared with those closed primarily. A tunnel is made through the middle third of the inframammary crease. The flap is transposed into the defect and inset in the mastectomy defect. Repair of the harvest site is then accomplished, the abdominal wound is closed over drains in layers, and then the new breast mound is formed.\n【60】 Anterolateral thigh flap — The anterolateral thigh flap is commonly used to provide additional coverage for the abdominal wall. Although the abdominal wall is an excellent source of flap material for local and regional repair, at times additional tissue is needed, such as following abdominal wall sarcoma resection or wounds that result from radiation treatment of cervical or prostate cancer.\n【61】 The anterolateral thigh flap is based on a descending branch of the lateral femoral circumflex artery and has a large arc of rotation . A limited arc can occur in some patients with a low takeoff of the vessel. The flap is commonly found to be septocutaneous; however, in some patients the perforator artery and veins traverse muscle and an intramuscular dissection is required.\n【62】 Donor site morbidity, including skin separation and lymphocele, are recognized complications of flap harvest.\n【63】 Radial forearm flap — The radial forearm flap is often used when there are exposed tendons or bone following trauma, infection, or surgical extirpation. This flap can also be transferred as a reverse flow flap if the patient has an intact palmar arch allowing coverage of the hand up to the metacarpophalangeal joints either on the dorsal or palmar surface.\n【64】 The radial forearm flap is an axial flap that can be raised as a fasciocutaneous flap, a fascia-only flap, or even an osteocutaneous flap (portion of the distal radius included) . It is based on the radial artery and the venae comitantes, though often superficial veins are included in the flap elevation to improve venous outflow.\n【65】 Dissection of the flap pedicle is relatively simple, following the path between brachioradialis and flexor carpi radialis with care to avoid radial nerve injury while elevating the flap.\n【66】 Donor site morbidity can be a problem with flaps that include skin since the donor site will usually require a skin graft for closure. This problem led to increasing use of a fascia-only flap, which allows primary skin repair at the donor site but requires skin grafting at the wound site instead.\n【67】 Medial gastrocnemius flap — One of the earliest described muscle flaps is the medial gastrocnemius flap. This flap is based on the medial sural artery and vein. The most common uses are salvage of total knee replacement and coverage of compound tibial fractures.   \"Surgical reconstruction of the lower extremity\".)\n【68】 The flap is elevated through a medial incision adjacent the tibia. This incision can be entirely separate from the recipient site, or, often, it connects to the recipient site at its most inferior aspect. The muscle is elevated from distal to proximal starting at the junction of the middle and distal third of the calf, taking care not to injure the Achilles tendon. The insertion site of the Achilles is transected, and the flap is lifted out of its bed. Dissection then proceeds proximally, releasing the muscle from all surrounding fascial attachments. The vascular pedicle enters the muscle high in the calf, just posterior to the knee joint, and is usually not formally dissected during flap elevation.\n【69】 The arc of rotation of this flap will cover the distal thigh down to the middle third of the calf. The transposition of the flap can be limited by the muscle fascia. This can be improved by scoring or removing the muscle fascia at the time of transfer. Following inset of the flap into the defect, a split-thickness skin graft can be applied. A negative pressure wound dressing is used to hold the skin graft in place. The knee is immobilized for two to four weeks while the flap and overlying graft heal.\n【70】 FUTURE DIRECTIONS — In addition to prefabricated and prelaminated flaps, an exciting new frontier in flap and reconstructive surgery is the creation of bioengineered flaps . The construction of such flaps is similar to the other efforts underway in tissue and organ transplantation (eg, modified pig heart). Fabricating bioengineered flaps is a complex undertaking, requiring knowledge of each component of the tissue to be engineered, including oxygen requirements.\n【71】 Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.

HPA axis suppression may lead to adrenal crisis. Withdrawal and discontinuation of a corticosteroid should be done slowly and carefully. Particular care is required when patients are transferred from systemic corticosteroids to inhaled corticosteroids due to possible adrenal insufficiency or withdrawal from steroids, including an increase in allergic symptoms. Adult patients receiving ≥20 mg per day of prednisone (or equivalent) may be most susceptible. Fatalities have occurred due to adrenal insufficiency in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to aerosol steroids; aerosol steroids do not provide the systemic steroid needed to treat patients having trauma, surgery, infections (particularly gastroenteritis), or other conditions with severe electrolyte loss. Select surgical patients on long-term, high-dose, inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) should be given stress doses of hydrocortisone IV during the surgical period and the dose reduced rapidly within 24 hours after surgery (NAEPP 2007). An eosinophilic esophagitis trial evaluated the impact of discontinuation of corticosteroid (oral budesonide or fluticasone, duration of therapy: 104.6 ± 23.7 days) in pediatric patients and showed 65.5% of subjects had adrenal suppression (AS) (diagnosed by low-dose ACTH stimulation test) and was further characterized as long-term with a median duration of 43 weeks (Ahmet 2016).\n【60】 Bronchospasm: Paradoxical bronchospasm that may be life-threatening may occur with use of inhaled bronchodilating agents; reaction should be distinguished from inadequate response. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs, discontinue fluticasone and institute alternative therapy.\n【61】 Hypersensitivity: Immediate hypersensitivity reactions (eg, angioedema, bronchospasm, hypotension, rash, urticaria), including anaphylaxis, may occur.\n【62】 Immunosuppression: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may increase the incidence of secondary infection, mask acute infection (including fungal infections), prolong or exacerbate viral infections, or limit response to vaccines. Avoid use if possible in patients with ocular herpes; tuberculosis (TB) infection (latent TB) or disease (active TB) of the respiratory tract; or viral, fungal, or bacterial or parasitic systemic infections. Exposure to chickenpox and measles should be avoided; if the patient is exposed, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin or pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin, respectively, may be indicated; if chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered.\n【63】 Oral candidiasis: Local oropharyngeal Candida infections have been reported; if this occurs, treat appropriately while continuing therapy. Patients should be instructed to rinse mouth with water without swallowing after each use.\n【64】 Vasculitis: Rare cases of vasculitis (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis [formerly known as Churg-Strauss]) or other systemic eosinophilic conditions can occur; often associated with decrease and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following initiation of inhaled corticosteroid.\n【65】 Asthma: Appropriate use: Supplemental steroids (oral or parenteral) may be needed during stress or severe asthma attacks. Use is contraindicated in status asthmaticus or during other acute episodes of asthma requiring intensive measures.\n【66】 Bone mineral density: Use with caution in patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral count such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, postmenopausal status, tobacco use, advanced age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (eg, antiseizure medications or oral corticosteroids); long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids have been associated with decreases in bone mineral density.\n【67】 Hepatic impairment: Use with caution in patients with hepatic impairment. Impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of fluticasone in plasma.\n【68】 Ocular disease: Use with caution in patients with cataracts and/or glaucoma; increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and cataracts have occurred with prolonged use. Consider routine eye exams in chronic users.\n【69】 Pneumonia: Inhaled corticosteroids, including fluticasone, have been associated with an increased risk of pneumonia in some long-term studies (>6 months) in COPD patients (Dransfield 2013; Yang 2012). In addition, an observational study found a reduction in this risk when the inhaled corticosteroid was discontinued, particularly so with fluticasone (Suissa 2015).\n【70】 Pediatric: Orally inhaled corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients (~1 centimeter per year [range: 0.3 to 1.8 cm per year] and related to dose and duration of exposure). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, each patient should be titrated to the lowest effective dose. Growth should be routinely monitored in pediatric patients.\n【71】 ArmonAir Digihaler, ArmonAir RespiClick, Arnuity Ellipta, and Flovent Diskus: May contain lactose; very rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients with severe milk protein allergy.\n【72】 Discontinuation of therapy: A gradual tapering of dose may be required prior to discontinuing therapy; there have been reports of systemic corticosteroid withdrawal symptoms when used both as inhalation and orally (eg, joint/muscle pain, lassitude, depression) when withdrawing oral inhalation therapy.\n【73】 Transfer to oral inhaler: When transferring to oral inhalation therapy from systemic corticosteroid therapy, previously suppressed allergic conditions (rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, and eosinophilic conditions) may be unmasked. Withdraw systemic corticosteroid therapy by gradually tapering the dose. Monitor lung function, beta-agonist use, asthma symptoms, and for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency (eg, fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea/vomiting, hypotension) during withdrawal.\n【74】 Warnings: Additional Pediatric Considerations\n【75】 Although recommended in children ≥12 years and adolescents, using higher doses (quintupled) in children <12 years of age has not shown efficacy and may be associated with a higher risk of adverse effects. A study in children 5 to 11 years of age with mild to moderate persistent asthma evaluated quintupling the dose of the inhaled corticosteroid (fluticasone) following the early signs of decreased asthma control; results showed that quintupled fluticasone dosages did not reduce the rate of severe exacerbations and may have been associated adverse effects (decreased linear growth, particularly in patients <8 years of age) (Jackson 2018).\n【76】 Product Availability\n【77】 ArmonAir RespiClick has been discontinued in the United States for >1 year.\n【78】 Dosage Forms Considerations\n【79】 Flovent HFA 10.6 g and 12 g canisters contain 120 inhalations.\n【80】 Dosage Forms: US\n【81】 Excipient information presented when available (limited, particularly for generics); consult specific product labeling.

Risk X: Avoid combination\n【145】 Clofazimine: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors). Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【146】 Cosyntropin: Corticosteroids (Orally Inhaled) may diminish the diagnostic effect of Cosyntropin.  Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【147】 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Moderate): May increase the serum concentration of Fluticasone (Oral Inhalation). Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【148】 CYP3A4 Inhibitors (Strong): May increase the serum concentration of Fluticasone (Oral Inhalation). Management: Consider alternatives to this combination if possible. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is not recommended. If combined, monitor patients for systemic corticosteroid adverse effects (eg, adrenal suppression). Risk D: Consider therapy modification\n【149】 Desmopressin: Corticosteroids (Orally Inhaled) may enhance the hyponatremic effect of Desmopressin.  Risk X: Avoid combination\n【150】 Fexinidazole: May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors). Risk X: Avoid combination\n【151】 Fusidic Acid (Systemic): May increase the serum concentration of CYP3A4 Substrates (High risk with Inhibitors). Risk X: Avoid combination\n【152】 Loxapine: Agents to Treat Airway Disease may enhance the adverse/toxic effect of Loxapine. More specifically, the use of Agents to Treat Airway Disease is likely a marker of patients who are likely at a greater risk for experiencing significant bronchospasm from use of inhaled loxapine.  Management: This is specific to the Adasuve brand of loxapine, which is an inhaled formulation.  This does not apply to non-inhaled formulations of loxapine. Risk X: Avoid combination\n【153】 Nirmatrelvir and Ritonavir: May increase the serum concentration of Fluticasone (Oral Inhalation). Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【154】 Tobacco (Smoked): May diminish the therapeutic effect of Corticosteroids (Orally Inhaled). Risk C: Monitor therapy\n【155】 Dietary Considerations\n【156】 ArmonAir Digihaler, ArmonAir RespiClick, Arnuity Ellipta, and Flovent Diskus may contain lactose; very rare anaphylactic reactions have been reported in patients with severe milk protein allergy.\n【157】 Reproductive Considerations\n【158】 Uncontrolled asthma may negatively affect fertility by increasing time to pregnancy and reducing birth rate. Fertility may be improved in patients adequately treated with inhaled corticosteroids (Couillard 2021; ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]). Inhaled corticosteroids used for the treatment of asthma should not be discontinued in patients planning to become pregnant (GINA 2022). The lowest dose that maintains asthma control should be continued (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]).\n【159】 Pregnancy Considerations\n【160】 Fluticasone can be detected in cord blood following maternal use via oral inhalation during pregnancy (Battista 2016).\n【161】 Maternal use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in usual doses is not associated with an increased risk of fetal malformations; a small risk of malformations was observed in one study following high maternal doses of an alternative ICS (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]).\n【162】 Uncontrolled asthma is associated with adverse events in pregnancy (increased risk of perinatal mortality, preeclampsia, preterm birth, low birth weight infants, cesarean delivery, and the development of gestational diabetes). Poorly controlled asthma or asthma exacerbations may have a greater fetal/maternal risk than what is associated with appropriately used asthma medications. Maternal treatment improves pregnancy outcomes by reducing the risk of some adverse events (eg, preterm birth, gestational diabetes) (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]; GINA 2022).\n【163】 ICS are recommended for the treatment of asthma during pregnancy. Due to the risk of exacerbations, stepping down or stopping ICS should not be done during pregnancy (GINA 2022). Fluticasone oral inhalation is considered compatible for use during pregnancy. Pregnant patients adequately controlled on fluticasone for asthma may continue therapy; if initiating treatment during pregnancy, use of an agent with more data in pregnant patients may be preferred. The lowest dose that maintains asthma control should be continued (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]). Maternal asthma symptoms should be monitored monthly during pregnancy (ERS/TSANZ [Middleton 2020]; GINA 2022).\n【164】 Monitoring Parameters\n【165】 Monitor growth in pediatric patients (via stadiometry). Check mucus membranes for signs of fungal infection. Monitor for symptoms of asthma, FEV1, peak flow, and/or other pulmonary function tests; HPA axis suppression; ocular effects (eg, cataracts, increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma); bone mineral density; possible eosinophilic conditions (including Churg-Strauss syndrome) and for hepatic impairment\n【166】 Mechanism of Action\n【167】 Fluticasone belongs to a group of corticosteroids which utilizes a fluorocarbothioate ester linkage at the 17 carbon position; extremely potent vasoconstrictive and anti-inflammatory activity. The effectiveness of inhaled fluticasone is due to its direct local effect.\n【168】 Pharmacokinetics (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【169】 Onset of action: Maximal benefit may take 1 to 2 weeks or longer.\n【170】 Absorption: Absorbed systemically primarily via lungs (Flovent Diskus: ~18%); minimal GI absorption (<1%) due to presystemic metabolism.\n【171】 Distribution: 4.2 L/kg.\n【172】 Protein binding: >99%.\n【173】 Metabolism: Hepatic via CYP3A4 to 17β-carboxylic acid (negligible activity).\n【174】 Bioavailability: Oral inhalation: 13.9%; Flovent Diskus: ~8%.\n【175】 Half-life elimination: IV: ~8 hours; Oral inhalation: Fluticasone furoate: 24 hours (plasma elimination phase following repeat dosing); Fluticasone propionate: ~11.2 hours (terminal half-life).\n【176】 Time to peak, plasma: 0.5 to 1 hour.\n【177】 Excretion: Feces (as parent drug and metabolites); urine (<5% as metabolites).\n【178】 Pharmacokinetics: Additional Considerations (Adult Data Unless Noted)\n【179】 Hepatic function impairment: Accumulation of fluticasone in plasma may occur.\n【180】 Brand Names: International\n【181】 International Brand Names by Country\n", "title": "Fluticasone (oral inhalation)  Pediatric drug information", "tags": "", "lang": "en", "attr": "{\"exta\": {\"url\": \"http://uptodate.98tsg.com//contents/fluticasone-oral-inhalation-pediatric-drug-information?search=%E5%8F%A3%E8%85%94%E3%80%81%E8%88%8C%E6%88%96%E5%94%87%E7%9A%84%E7%97%87%E7%8A%B6%E6%88%96%E4%B8%BB%E8%AF%89&source=search_result&selectedTitle=37%7E150&usage_type=default\"}}", "ext": "{}", "dataset": "dataset", "batch_name": "20231117", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": null, "type6": null, "type5": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 01:15:49", "update_time": "2024-03-04 23:16:39"}

To prevent hyperphosphatemia, interrupt burosumab therapy in patients with tumor-induced osteomalacia receiving treatment for the underlying tumor. Reassess serum phosphorus after underlying tumor-related treatment has been completed; reinitiate and adjust burosumab dose as clinically necessary.\n【42】 Hypersensitivity: May cause hypersensitivity reactions (eg, rash, urticaria). Discontinue therapy immediately if serious hypersensitivity reactions occur.\n【43】 Injection site reactions: Local injection site reactions may occur. Most reactions are mild in severity, occur within 1 day of injection, and typically resolve within 1 to 3 days with no treatment. Discontinue use if severe injection site reactions occur.\n【44】 Restless leg syndrome: New onset or worsening of existing restless leg syndrome has been reported in adults.\n【45】 Polysorbate 80: Some dosage forms may contain polysorbate 80 (also known as Tweens). Hypersensitivity reactions, usually a delayed reaction, have been reported following exposure to pharmaceutical products containing polysorbate 80 in certain individuals (Isaksson 2002; Lucente 2000; Shelley 1995).
